### [1] [Hierarchical Process Reward Models are Symbolic Vision Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03126)
*Shan Zhang,Aotian Chen,Kai Zou,Jindong Gu,Yuan Xue,Anton van den Hengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their relationships, using hierarchical rewards for consistency. It outperforms pixel-based models and GPT-4o in reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable interpretable diagram understanding in machine vision by shifting from pixel-based models to symbolic representations with logical rules.

Method: Proposes a symbolic auto-encoder with hierarchical rewards for parsing diagrams into geometric primitives and relationships, stabilized reinforcement learning for reconstruction, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks.

Result: Achieves 98.2% MSE reduction in reconstruction, surpasses GPT-4o by 0.6% in chart reconstruction, and improves by +13% on perception and +3% on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The neuro-symbolic system combines neural reasoning with symbolic interpretability, demonstrating superior performance in diagram-related tasks.

Abstract: Symbolic computer vision represents diagrams through explicit logical rules and structured representations, enabling interpretable understanding in machine vision. This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks.

### [2] [Drainage: A Unifying Framework for Addressing Class Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03182)
*Yasser Taha,Grégoire Montavon,Nils Körber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a 'drainage node' framework to handle noisy labels and ambiguous data in deep learning, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in deep learning like noisy labels, class ambiguity, and rejection of out-of-distribution samples.

Method: Introduces a 'drainage node' at the network output to reallocate probability mass toward uncertainty while maintaining end-to-end training.

Result: Achieves up to 9% accuracy improvement in high-noise scenarios and matches/surpasses state-of-the-art on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The drainage node framework enhances robustness, stability, and applicability beyond classification tasks.

Abstract: Modern deep learning faces significant challenges with noisy labels, class ambiguity, as well as the need to robustly reject out-of-distribution or corrupted samples. In this work, we propose a unified framework based on the concept of a "drainage node'' which we add at the output of the network. The node serves to reallocate probability mass toward uncertainty, while preserving desirable properties such as end-to-end training and differentiability. This mechanism provides a natural escape route for highly ambiguous, anomalous, or noisy samples, particularly relevant for instance-dependent and asymmetric label noise. In systematic experiments involving the addition of varying proportions of instance-dependent noise or asymmetric noise to CIFAR-10/100 labels, our drainage formulation achieves an accuracy increase of up to 9\% over existing approaches in the high-noise regime. Our results on real-world datasets, such as mini-WebVision, mini-ImageNet and Clothing-1M, match or surpass existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analysis reveals a denoising effect, where the drainage neuron consistently absorbs corrupt, mislabeled, or outlier data, leading to more stable decision boundaries. Furthermore, our drainage formulation enables applications well beyond classification, with immediate benefits for web-scale, semi-supervised dataset cleaning, and open-set applications.

### [3] [Does Head Pose Correction Improve Biometric Facial Recognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03199)
*Justin Norman,Hany Farid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Targeted AI-driven head-pose correction and image restoration are explored to improve biometric facial recognition accuracy in poor-quality images, with selective CFR-GAN and CodeFormer combination showing promise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric facial recognition models struggle with real-world images due to poor quality, non-frontal poses, and occlusions, prompting research into restoration techniques.

Method: Evaluated three restoration approaches (NextFace, CFR-GAN, CodeFormer) using a model-agnostic pipeline to assess their impact on recognition accuracy.

Result: Naive application degraded accuracy, but selective use of CFR-GAN with CodeFormer improved recognition performance.

Conclusion: Selective AI-driven restoration can enhance facial recognition accuracy in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Biometric facial recognition models often demonstrate significant decreases in accuracy when processing real-world images, often characterized by poor quality, non-frontal subject poses, and subject occlusions. We investigate whether targeted, AI-driven, head-pose correction and image restoration can improve recognition accuracy. Using a model-agnostic, large-scale, forensic-evaluation pipeline, we assess the impact of three restoration approaches: 3D reconstruction (NextFace), 2D frontalization (CFR-GAN), and feature enhancement (CodeFormer). We find that naive application of these techniques substantially degrades facial recognition accuracy. However, we also find that selective application of CFR-GAN combined with CodeFormer yields meaningful improvements.

### [4] [Flux4D: Flow-based Unsupervised 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03210)
*Jingkang Wang,Henry Che,Yun Chen,Ze Yang,Lily Goli,Sivabalan Manivasagam,Raquel Urtasun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flux4D is a scalable, unsupervised framework for 4D reconstruction of dynamic scenes, outperforming existing methods in quality, scalability, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS face scalability issues and require annotations or per-scene optimization, limiting their practicality for large-scale dynamic scenes.

Method: Flux4D predicts 3D Gaussians and motion dynamics using photometric losses and regularization, eliminating the need for annotations or pre-trained models.

Result: Flux4D enables rapid reconstruction of dynamic scenes, scales well, and generalizes to unseen environments, showing superior performance on outdoor datasets.

Conclusion: Flux4D offers a simple yet effective solution for unsupervised 4D reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in scalability and generalization.

Abstract: Reconstructing large-scale dynamic scenes from visual observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with critical implications for robotics and autonomous systems. While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an "as static as possible" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes. Our approach enables efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes within seconds, scales effectively to large datasets, and generalizes well to unseen environments, including rare and unknown objects. Experiments on outdoor driving datasets show Flux4D significantly outperforms existing methods in scalability, generalization, and reconstruction quality.

### [5] [Object Counting with GPT-4o and GPT-5: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03233)
*Richard Füzesséry,Kaziwa Saleh,Sándor Szénási,Zoltán Vámossy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using multi-modal LLMs (GPT-4o and GPT-5) for zero-shot object counting with textual prompts, achieving performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities for unsupervised zero-shot object counting, eliminating the need for annotated data or visual exemplars.

Method: Utilizes GPT-4o and GPT-5 with textual prompts to perform counting on the FSC-147 and CARPK datasets.

Result: The models achieve competitive performance on FSC-147, sometimes exceeding state-of-the-art zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for zero-shot object counting, offering a viable alternative to traditional supervised approaches.

Abstract: Zero-shot object counting attempts to estimate the number of object instances belonging to novel categories that the vision model performing the counting has never encountered during training. Existing methods typically require large amount of annotated data and often require visual exemplars to guide the counting process. However, large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools with remarkable reasoning and data understanding abilities, which suggest the possibility of utilizing them for counting tasks without any supervision. In this work we aim to leverage the visual capabilities of two multi-modal LLMs, GPT-4o and GPT-5, to perform object counting in a zero-shot manner using only textual prompts. We evaluate both models on the FSC-147 and CARPK datasets and provide a comparative analysis. Our findings show that the models achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art zero-shot approaches on FSC-147, in some cases, even surpass them.

### [6] [LLM-Guided Material Inference for 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03237)
*Nafiseh Izadyar,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage LLM-based method infers material composition from 3D point clouds by decoupling object identity from material properties, achieving high plausibility without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D shape datasets and models neglect material properties, which are crucial for object appearance.

Method: A two-stage LLM approach: first predicts object semantics, then assigns materials to segments, both zero-shot.

Result: Evaluated on 1,000 shapes, the method achieves high semantic and material plausibility using LLM-as-a-Judge.

Conclusion: LLMs can bridge geometric reasoning and material understanding in 3D data as general-purpose priors.

Abstract: Most existing 3D shape datasets and models focus solely on geometry, overlooking the material properties that determine how objects appear. We introduce a two-stage large language model (LLM) based method for inferring material composition directly from 3D point clouds with coarse segmentations. Our key insight is to decouple reasoning about what an object is from what it is made of. In the first stage, an LLM predicts the object's semantic; in the second stage, it assigns plausible materials to each geometric segment, conditioned on the inferred semantics. Both stages operate in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific training. Because existing datasets lack reliable material annotations, we evaluate our method using an LLM-as-a-Judge implemented in DeepEval. Across 1,000 shapes from Fusion/ABS and ShapeNet, our method achieves high semantic and material plausibility. These results demonstrate that language models can serve as general-purpose priors for bridging geometric reasoning and material understanding in 3D data.

### [7] [2-Shots in the Dark: Low-Light Denoising with Minimal Data Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03245)
*Liying Lu,Raphaël Achddou,Sabine Süsstrunk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a practical noise synthesis method for low-light denoising using only one noisy image and dark frame per ISO, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based denoisers need paired datasets of clean-noisy images, which are hard to collect, prompting the need for synthetic noise models.

Method: Uses Poisson distribution for signal-dependent noise and Fourier-domain spectral sampling for signal-independent noise, requiring minimal data.

Result: Accurately models noise properties, outperforming competitors without relying on large datasets or simplified models.

Conclusion: The method is effective, practical, and delivers top performance in low-light denoising benchmarks.

Abstract: Raw images taken in low-light conditions are very noisy due to low photon count and sensor noise. Learning-based denoisers have the potential to reconstruct high-quality images. For training, however, these denoisers require large paired datasets of clean and noisy images, which are difficult to collect. Noise synthesis is an alternative to large-scale data acquisition: given a clean image, we can synthesize a realistic noisy counterpart. In this work, we propose a general and practical noise synthesis method that requires only one single noisy image and one single dark frame per ISO setting. We represent signal-dependent noise with a Poisson distribution and introduce a Fourier-domain spectral sampling algorithm to accurately model signal-independent noise. The latter generates diverse noise realizations that maintain the spatial and statistical properties of real sensor noise. As opposed to competing approaches, our method neither relies on simplified parametric models nor on large sets of clean-noisy image pairs. Our synthesis method is not only accurate and practical, it also leads to state-of-the-art performances on multiple low-light denoising benchmarks.

### [8] [PixPerfect: Seamless Latent Diffusion Local Editing with Discriminative Pixel-Space Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03247)
*Haitian Zheng,Yuan Yao,Yongsheng Yu,Yuqian Zhou,Jiebo Luo,Zhe Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixPerfect is a pixel-level refinement framework for LDMs that addresses pixel-level inconsistencies in local image editing, achieving high-fidelity results across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fully eliminate artifacts like chromatic shifts and texture mismatches introduced by latent compression in LDMs.

Method: PixPerfect uses a differentiable discriminative pixel space, an artifact simulation pipeline, and direct pixel-space refinement to improve editing quality.

Result: Experiments show PixPerfect enhances perceptual fidelity and performance in tasks like inpainting and object removal.

Conclusion: PixPerfect sets a new standard for robust, high-fidelity local image editing with LDMs.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have markedly advanced the quality of image inpainting and local editing. However, the inherent latent compression often introduces pixel-level inconsistencies, such as chromatic shifts, texture mismatches, and visible seams along editing boundaries. Existing remedies, including background-conditioned latent decoding and pixel-space harmonization, usually fail to fully eliminate these artifacts in practice and do not generalize well across different latent representations or tasks. We introduce PixPerfect, a pixel-level refinement framework that delivers seamless, high-fidelity local edits across diverse LDM architectures and tasks. PixPerfect leverages (i) a differentiable discriminative pixel space that amplifies and suppresses subtle color and texture discrepancies, (ii) a comprehensive artifact simulation pipeline that exposes the refiner to realistic local editing artifacts during training, and (iii) a direct pixel-space refinement scheme that ensures broad applicability across diverse latent representations and tasks. Extensive experiments on inpainting, object removal, and insertion benchmarks demonstrate that PixPerfect substantially enhances perceptual fidelity and downstream editing performance, establishing a new standard for robust and high-fidelity localized image editing.

### [9] [PyroFocus: A Deep Learning Approach to Real-Time Wildfire Detection in Multispectral Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03257)
*Mark Moussa,Andre Williams,Seth Roffe,Douglas Morton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates deep learning models for wildfire detection using multispectral/hyperspectral data, introduces PyroFocus for efficient onboard processing, and demonstrates its effectiveness with NASA's MASTER data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires necessitate low-latency, efficient onboard detection methods for real-time emergency and environmental management.

Method: The study compares custom CNNs and Transformer models for fire classification and introduces PyroFocus, a two-stage pipeline for classification and FRP regression/segmentation to optimize onboard resources.

Result: PyroFocus balances speed and accuracy, showing promise for real-time edge deployment in wildfire monitoring.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is computationally efficient and effective for real-time fire detection, making it suitable for future missions.

Abstract: Rapid and accurate wildfire detection is crucial for emergency response and environmental management. In airborne and spaceborne missions, real-time algorithms must distinguish between no fire, active fire, and post-fire conditions, and estimate fire intensity. Multispectral and hyperspectral thermal imagers provide rich spectral information, but high data dimensionality and limited onboard resources make real-time processing challenging. As wildfires increase in frequency and severity, the need for low-latency and computationally efficient onboard detection methods is critical.
  We present a systematic evaluation of multiple deep learning architectures, including custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, for multi-class fire classification. We also introduce PyroFocus, a two-stage pipeline that performs fire classification followed by fire radiative power (FRP) regression or segmentation to reduce inference time and computational cost for onboard deployment. Using data from NASA's MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER), which is similar to a next-generation fire detection sensor, we compare accuracy, inference latency, and resource efficiency.
  Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage pipeline achieves strong trade-offs between speed and accuracy, demonstrating significant potential for real-time edge deployment in future wildfire monitoring missions.

### [10] [SpatialReasoner: Active Perception for Large-Scale 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03284)
*Hongpei Zheng,Shijie Li,Yanran Li,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces H$^2$U3D, a dataset for house-scale 3D visual question answering, and SpatialReasoner, an active perception framework that outperforms baselines with fewer images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments, where current models are limited to room-scale scenarios.

Method: Proposes H$^2$U3D dataset with multi-floor environments and automated annotations, and SpatialReasoner framework using supervised learning followed by reinforcement learning with adaptive rewards.

Result: SpatialReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on H$^2$U3D, using significantly fewer images (3-4) compared to baselines (16+).

Conclusion: The coarse-to-fine active exploration paradigm is effective for large-scale 3D spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments remains challenging for current vision-language models, which are typically constrained to room-scale scenarios. We introduce H$^2$U3D (Holistic House Understanding in 3D), a 3D visual question answering dataset designed for house-scale scene understanding. H$^2$U3D features multi-floor environments spanning up to three floors and 10-20 rooms, covering more than 300 m$^2$. Through an automated annotation pipeline, it constructs hierarchical coarse-to-fine visual representations and generates diverse question-answer pairs with chain-of-thought annotations. We further propose SpatialReasoner, an active perception framework that autonomously invokes spatial tools to explore 3D scenes based on textual queries. SpatialReasoner is trained through a two-stage strategy: a supervised cold start followed by reinforcement learning with an adaptive exploration reward that promotes efficient exploration while discouraging redundant operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpatialReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on H$^2$U3D, outperforming strong baselines including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Pro. Notably, our method attains superior results while using only 3-4 images in total on average, compared to baselines requiring 16+ images, highlighting the effectiveness of our coarse-to-fine active exploration paradigm.

### [11] [NavMapFusion: Diffusion-based Fusion of Navigation Maps for Online Vectorized HD Map Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03317)
*Thomas Monninger,Zihan Zhang,Steffen Staab,Sihao Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NavMapFusion is a diffusion-based framework that merges low-fidelity navigation maps with high-fidelity sensor data for accurate, real-time environmental representations in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HD maps are static and require online updates due to constantly changing environments. SD maps are too coarse for direct use but can guide online map construction.

Method: NavMapFusion uses iterative denoising conditioned on sensor data and low-fidelity maps, treating discrepancies as noise in the diffusion process.

Result: The method improves accuracy by 21.4% on 100 m ranges and scales well for larger ranges, maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: NavMapFusion effectively fuses coarse priors with sensor data, enabling accurate and up-to-date maps for safer autonomous driving.

Abstract: Accurate environmental representations are essential for autonomous driving, providing the foundation for safe and efficient navigation. Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

### [12] [Step-by-step Layered Design Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03335)
*Faizan Farooq Khan,K J Joseph,Koustava Goswami,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Balaji Vasan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SLEDGE, a method for step-by-step layered design generation, addressing the gap in treating design synthesis as a single-step process. It includes a new dataset and benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches overlook the complexity of design generation by treating it as a single-step problem, ignoring the progressive refinement inherent in creative processes.

Method: Proposes SLEDGE, leveraging multi-modal LLMs to model design updates as layered changes grounded in sequential instructions. Introduces a new dataset and benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Experimental analysis shows SLEDGE's efficacy compared to state-of-the-art methods tailored to the new problem setting.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of step-by-step design generation and encourages further research in this under-explored area.

Abstract: Design generation, in its essence, is a step-by-step process where designers progressively refine and enhance their work through careful modifications. Despite this fundamental characteristic, existing approaches mainly treat design synthesis as a single-step generation problem, significantly underestimating the inherent complexity of the creative process. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel problem setting called Step-by-Step Layered Design Generation, which tasks a machine learning model with generating a design that adheres to a sequence of instructions from a designer. Leveraging recent advancements in multi-modal LLMs, we propose SLEDGE: Step-by-step LayEred Design GEnerator to model each update to a design as an atomic, layered change over its previous state, while being grounded in the instruction. To complement our new problem setting, we introduce a new evaluation suite, including a dataset and a benchmark. Our exhaustive experimental analysis and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches tailored to our new setup demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We hope our work will attract attention to this pragmatic and under-explored research area.

### [13] [ProtoEFNet: Dynamic Prototype Learning for Inherently Interpretable Ejection Fraction Estimation in Echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03339)
*Yeganeh Ghamary,Victoria Wu,Hooman Vaseli,Christina Luong,Teresa Tsang,Siavash Bigdeli,Purang Abolmaesumi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoEFNet is a video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression, offering interpretability and accuracy comparable to black-box models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EF estimation is manual and subjective, while existing deep learning lacks transparency, reducing clinical trust.

Method: ProtoEFNet uses dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes and a Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss for discriminative representations.

Result: Achieves accuracy similar to non-interpretable models, with a 2% F1 score boost using PAS loss.

Conclusion: ProtoEFNet combines interpretability and accuracy, enhancing clinical trust in EF prediction.

Abstract: Ejection fraction (EF) is a crucial metric for assessing cardiac function and diagnosing conditions such as heart failure. Traditionally, EF estimation requires manual tracing and domain expertise, making the process time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. Most current deep learning methods for EF prediction are black-box models with limited transparency, which reduces clinical trust. Some post-hoc explainability methods have been proposed to interpret the decision-making process after the prediction is made. However, these explanations do not guide the model's internal reasoning and therefore offer limited reliability in clinical applications. To address this, we introduce ProtoEFNet, a novel video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression. The model learns dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes that capture clinically meaningful cardiac motion patterns. Additionally, the proposed Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss enforces discriminative representations across the continuous EF spectrum. Our experiments on the EchonetDynamic dataset show that ProtoEFNet can achieve accuracy on par with its non-interpretable counterpart while providing clinically relevant insight. The ablation study shows that the proposed loss boosts performance with a 2% increase in F1 score from 77.67$\pm$2.68 to 79.64$\pm$2.10.

### [14] [HalluGen: Synthesizing Realistic and Controllable Hallucinations for Evaluating Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03345)
*Seunghoi Kim,Henry F. J. Tregidgo,Chen Jin,Matteo Figini,Daniel C. Alexander*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework, synthesizes realistic hallucinations for evaluating and mitigating errors in safety-critical image restoration, demonstrated in low-field MRI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in generative models undermine reliability in safety-critical domains like medical imaging, but evaluating them is hindered by costly and subjective labeled data.

Method: Introduces HalluGen to synthesize controllable hallucinations, creating a large-scale dataset (4,350 annotated images) for systematic evaluation.

Result: HalluGen produces realistic but incorrect outputs (IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36) and enables benchmarking hallucination metrics and training detectors.

Conclusion: HalluGen provides a scalable foundation for evaluating hallucinations in safety-critical image restoration, improving reliability and trust.

Abstract: Generative models are prone to hallucinations: plausible but incorrect structures absent in the ground truth. This issue is problematic in image restoration for safety-critical domains such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, where such errors undermine reliability and trust. For example, in low-field MRI, widely used in resource-limited settings, restoration models are essential for enhancing low-quality scans, yet hallucinations can lead to serious diagnostic errors. Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, we construct the first large-scale hallucination dataset comprising 4,350 annotated images derived from 1,450 brain MR images for low-field enhancement, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation. We demonstrate its utility in two applications: (1) benchmarking image quality metrics and developing Semantic Hallucination Assessment via Feature Evaluation (SHAFE), a feature-based metric with soft-attention pooling that improves hallucination sensitivity over traditional metrics; and (2) training reference-free hallucination detectors that generalize to real restoration failures. Together, HalluGen and its open dataset establish the first scalable foundation for evaluating hallucinations in safety-critical image restoration.

### [15] [Hierarchical Attention for Sparse Volumetric Anomaly Detection in Subclinical Keratoconus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03346)
*Lynn Kandakji,William Woof,Nikolas Pontikos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hierarchical attention models outperform 2D/3D CNNs and ViTs in detecting sparse anomalies in volumetric medical imaging, showing higher sensitivity and specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting subtle, non-adjacent early disease signals in volumetric medical imaging, which existing architectures fail to capture optimally.

Method: Compares sixteen deep learning architectures (2D/3D CNNs, hybrids, volumetric transformers) for subclinical keratoconus detection using 3D OCT volumes.

Result: Hierarchical attention models achieve 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity, with mechanistic analyses revealing better spatial scale alignment.

Conclusion: Hierarchical attention is a principled and effective approach for early pathological change detection in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: The detection of weak, spatially distributed anomalies in volumetric medical imaging remains a major challenge. The subtle, non-adjacent nature of early disease signals is often lost due to suboptimal architectural inductive biases: 2D/3D CNNs impose strong locality, while ViTs diffuse unconstrained global attention. This conflict leaves the optimal inductive structure for robust, sparse volumetric pattern recognition unresolved. This study presents a controlled comparison of sixteen modern deep learning architectures spanning 2D/3D convolutional, hybrid, and volumetric transformer families for subclinical keratoconus (SKC) detection from 3D anterior segment OCT volumes. We demonstrate that hierarchical attention models offer a superior and more parameter-efficient inductive bias, surpassing the performance of both 2D and 3D CNNs and ViTs. Our results show 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity in the sparse anomaly (subclinical) regime. Mechanistic analyses reveal that this advantage stems from precise spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate, multi-slice extent of subclinical abnormalities. This avoids excessive CNN locality and diffuse global attention. Attention-distance measurements confirm a key insight into architectural adaptation: the required spatial integration length shifts significantly based on the signal strength, with subclinical cases necessitating longer integration compared to both healthy and manifest disease states. Representational similarity and auxiliary age/sex prediction tasks further support the generalizability of these inductive principles. The findings provide design guidance for future volumetric anomaly detection systems, establishing hierarchical attention as a principled and effective approach for early pathological change analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Motivation: Current visual tasks operate on 2D projections, limiting performance. Modeling the full 4D world (3D space + time) could improve understanding and generation.

Method: SeeU reconstructs 4D from 2D frames, learns continuous 4D dynamics with low-rank representation and physical constraints, then reprojects to 2D for novel content.

Result: SeeU achieves continuous, physically-consistent visual generation, excelling in tasks like unseen temporal/spatial generation and video editing.

Conclusion: Modeling dynamics in 4D enhances visual tasks, showcasing SeeU's potential for novel content generation.

Abstract: Images and videos are discrete 2D projections of the 4D world (3D space + time). Most visual understanding, prediction, and generation operate directly on 2D observations, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose SeeU, a novel approach that learns the continuous 4D dynamics and generate the unseen visual contents. The principle behind SeeU is a new 2D$\to$4D$\to$2D learning framework. SeeU first reconstructs the 4D world from sparse and monocular 2D frames (2D$\to$4D). It then learns the continuous 4D dynamics on a low-rank representation and physical constraints (discrete 4D$\to$continuous 4D). Finally, SeeU rolls the world forward in time, re-projects it back to 2D at sampled times and viewpoints, and generates unseen regions based on spatial-temporal context awareness (4D$\to$2D). By modeling dynamics in 4D, SeeU achieves continuous and physically-consistent novel visual generation, demonstrating strong potentials in multiple tasks including unseen temporal generation, unseen spatial generation, and video editing.

*Md Rashidul Islam,Bakary Gibba,Altagi Abdallah Bakheit Abdelgadir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a deep learning-based system for automatic lung cancer classification using CT scans, achieving 98% accuracy with DenseNet169 and SVM models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of lung cancer is critical for patient survival, but manual CT scan interpretation is slow and error-prone.

Method: Uses DenseNet169 with attention-based feature extraction, Focal Loss, and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN); integrates SVM with MobileNetV2 for features. Incorporates Grad-CAM and SHAP for interpretability.

Result: Both models achieved 98% accuracy, demonstrating high robustness for medical applications.

Conclusion: Deep learning can enhance lung cancer diagnosis with accuracy, transparency, and robustness.

Abstract: Lung cancer is a very deadly disease worldwide, and its early diagnosis is crucial for increasing patient survival rates. Computed tomography (CT) scans are widely used for lung cancer diagnosis as they can give detailed lung structures. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and prone to human error. To surmount this challenge, the study proposes a deep learning-based automatic lung cancer classification system to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. The IQOTHNCCD lung cancer dataset is utilized, which is a public CT scan dataset consisting of cases categorized into Normal, Benign, and Malignant and used DenseNet169, which includes Squeezeand-Excitation blocks for attention-based feature extraction, Focal Loss for handling class imbalance, and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature fusion. In addition, an SVM model was developed using MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, improving its classification performance. For model interpretability enhancement, the study integrated Grad-CAM for the visualization of decision-making regions in CT scans and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for explanation of feature contributions within the SVM model. Intensive evaluation was performed, and it was found that both DenseNet169 and SVM models achieved 98% accuracy, suggesting their robustness for real-world medical practice. These results open up the potential for deep learning to improve the diagnosis of lung cancer by a higher level of accuracy, transparency, and robustness.

*Nan Zhou,Huandong Wang,Jiahao Li,Han Li,Yali Song,Qiuhua Wang,Yong Li,Xinlei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FireSentry introduces a high-resolution wildfire dataset and FiReDiff, a dual-modality model, significantly improving fine-grained wildfire spread prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wildfire prediction models lack fine-grained spatiotemporal resolution. FireSentry aims to bridge this gap with high-resolution data.

Method: FireSentry collects sub-meter spatial and sub-second temporal data via UAVs. FiReDiff predicts infrared video sequences first, then segments fire masks.

Result: FiReDiff outperforms existing methods with significant gains in video quality (up to 50%) and mask accuracy (up to 62.5%).

Conclusion: FireSentry and FiReDiff advance fine-grained wildfire forecasting and dynamic disaster simulation, with the dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Fine-grained wildfire spread prediction is crucial for enhancing emergency response efficacy and decision-making precision. However, existing research predominantly focuses on coarse spatiotemporal scales and relies on low-resolution satellite data, capturing only macroscopic fire states while fundamentally constraining high-precision localized fire dynamics modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present FireSentry, a provincial-scale multi-modal wildfire dataset characterized by sub-meter spatial and sub-second temporal resolution. Collected using synchronized UAV platforms, FireSentry provides visible and infrared video streams, in-situ environmental measurements, and manually validated fire masks. Building on FireSentry, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing physics-based, data-driven, and generative models, revealing the limitations of existing mask-only approaches. Our analysis proposes FiReDiff, a novel dual-modality paradigm that first predicts future video sequences in the infrared modality, and then precisely segments fire masks in the mask modality based on the generated dynamics. FiReDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with video quality gains of 39.2% in PSNR, 36.1% in SSIM, 50.0% in LPIPS, 29.4% in FVD, and mask accuracy gains of 3.3% in AUPRC, 59.1% in F1 score, 42.9% in IoU, and 62.5% in MSE when applied to generative models. The FireSentry benchmark dataset and FiReDiff paradigm collectively advance fine-grained wildfire forecasting and dynamic disaster simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShelfGaussian is a multi-modal Gaussian-based 3D scene understanding framework leveraging vision foundation models for supervision, outperforming existing methods in tasks like semantic occupancy prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian-based methods either limit object representation to closed-set semantics or rely on 2D self-supervision, compromising rendering ability or geometry quality.

Method: Introduces a Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer for feature querying across sensor modalities and a Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm for joint optimization at 2D and 3D levels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic occupancy prediction on Occ3D-nuScenes and performs well in real-world UGV scenarios.

Conclusion: ShelfGaussian effectively combines multi-modal sensing and advanced supervision to enhance 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: We introduce ShelfGaussian, an open-vocabulary multi-modal Gaussian-based 3D scene understanding framework supervised by off-the-shelf vision foundation models (VFMs). Gaussian-based methods have demonstrated superior performance and computational efficiency across a wide range of scene understanding tasks. However, existing methods either model objects as closed-set semantic Gaussians supervised by annotated 3D labels, neglecting their rendering ability, or learn open-set Gaussian representations via purely 2D self-supervision, leading to degraded geometry and limited to camera-only settings. To fully exploit the potential of Gaussians, we propose a Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer that enables Gaussians to query features from diverse sensor modalities, and a Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm that efficiently optimizes Gaussians with VFM features jointly at 2D image and 3D scene levels. We evaluate ShelfGaussian on various perception and planning tasks. Experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes demonstrate its state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic occupancy prediction performance. ShelfGaussian is further evaluated on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to assess its in the-wild performance across diverse urban scenarios.

*Yujian Zhao,Hankun Liu,Guanglin Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOS is a novel framework addressing the optical-SAR modality gap for ship ReID, using modality-consistent learning and cross-modal data generation to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal ship ReID between optical and SAR imagery is crucial for maritime surveillance but hindered by the significant modality gap.

Method: MOS combines Modality-Consistent Representation Learning (denoising SAR images and class-wise alignment loss) and Cross-modal Data Generation and Feature fusion (using a diffusion model for synthesis and feature fusion).

Result: MOS achieves significant improvements (+3.0%, +6.2%, +16.4% in R1 accuracy) across evaluation protocols on the HOSS ReID dataset.

Conclusion: MOS effectively bridges the optical-SAR modality gap and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with plans to release code and models.

Abstract: Cross-modal ship re-identification (ReID) between optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has recently emerged as a critical yet underexplored task in maritime intelligence and surveillance. However, the substantial modality gap between optical and SAR images poses a major challenge for robust identification. To address this issue, we propose MOS, a novel framework designed to mitigate the optical-SAR modality gap and achieve modality-consistent feature learning for optical-SAR cross-modal ship ReID. MOS consists of two core components: (1) Modality-Consistent Representation Learning (MCRL) applies denoise SAR image procession and a class-wise modality alignment loss to align intra-identity feature distributions across modalities. (2) Cross-modal Data Generation and Feature fusion (CDGF) leverages a brownian bridge diffusion model to synthesize cross-modal samples, which are subsequently fused with original features during inference to enhance alignment and discriminability. Extensive experiments on the HOSS ReID dataset demonstrate that MOS significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation protocols, achieving notable improvements of +3.0%, +6.2%, and +16.4% in R1 accuracy under the ALL to ALL, Optical to SAR, and SAR to Optical settings, respectively. The code and trained models will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViDiC-1K, a dataset and task for Video Difference Captioning (ViDiC), addressing the gap in models' ability to describe differences between video pairs. It evaluates multimodal models using a dual-checklist framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored capability of vision-language systems in understanding dynamic scene differences, particularly compositional, spatial, and temporal changes.

Method: Introduces ViDiC-1K dataset with 1,000 video pairs annotated for seven categories, and proposes a dual-checklist evaluation framework using LLM-as-a-Judge.

Result: Experiments on nineteen multimodal models show a performance gap in comparative description and difference perception.

Conclusion: ViDiC-1K serves as a challenging benchmark for advancing video understanding, edit awareness, and comparative reasoning in multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Understanding visual differences between dynamic scenes requires the comparative perception of compositional, spatial, and temporal changes--a capability that remains underexplored in existing vision-language systems. While prior work on Image Difference Captioning (IDC) has enabled models to describe semantic changes between static images, these approaches fail to capture motion continuity, event evolution, or editing consistency over time. We introduce the ViDiC (Video Difference Captioning) task and its corresponding ViDiC-1K dataset, designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide fine-grained descriptions of similarities and differences between video pairs. ViDiC-1K comprises 1,000 curated video pairs annotated with over 4,000 comparative checklist items, covering seven categories: subject, style, background, cinematography, motion, location, and playback techniques. To ensure reliable evaluation, we propose a dual-checklist framework that measures the accuracy of similarity and difference separately, based on the LLM-as-a-Judge protocol. Experiments on nineteen representative multimodal models reveal a significant performance gap in their comparative description and difference perception abilities. We hope ViDiC-1K can be a challenging benchmark that lays a solid foundation for advancing video understanding, edit awareness, and comparative reasoning in multimodal intelligence.

*Yuqi Ji,Junjie Ke,Lihuo He,Jun Liu,Kaifan Zhang,Yu-Kun Lai,Guiguang Ding,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLOA introduces a real-time affordance detection model integrating object detection and affordance learning via an LLM adapter, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing affordance detection methods either focus only on the 'how' aspect or treat object detection and affordance learning as separate tasks, lacking interaction and real-time capability.

Method: YOLOA employs a lightweight detector with object detection and affordance learning branches refined by an LLM Adapter, improving class priors, box offsets, and affordance gates.

Result: YOLOA achieves 52.8 / 73.1 mAP on ADG-Det / IIT-Heat benchmarks with real-time performance (up to 89.77 FPS).

Conclusion: YOLOA successfully balances accuracy and efficiency in affordance detection.

Abstract: Affordance detection aims to jointly address the fundamental "what-where-how" challenge in embodied AI by understanding "what" an object is, "where" the object is located, and "how" it can be used. However, most affordance learning methods focus solely on "how" objects can be used while neglecting the "what" and "where" aspects. Other affordance detection methods treat object detection and affordance learning as two independent tasks, lacking effective interaction and real-time capability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce YOLO Affordance (YOLOA), a real-time affordance detection model that jointly handles these two tasks via a large language model (LLM) adapter. Specifically, YOLOA employs a lightweight detector consisting of object detection and affordance learning branches refined through the LLM Adapter. During training, the LLM Adapter interacts with object and affordance preliminary predictions to refine both branches by generating more accurate class priors, box offsets, and affordance gates. Experiments on our relabeled ADG-Det and IIT-Heat benchmarks demonstrate that YOLOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (52.8 / 73.1 mAP on ADG-Det / IIT-Heat) while maintaining real-time performance (up to 89.77 FPS, and up to 846.24 FPS for the lightweight variant). This indicates that YOLOA achieves an excellent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: A label-efficient framework uses frozen diffusion model features for hyperspectral imaging classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with sparse labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) faces challenges like low spatial resolution and sparse annotations, prompting the need for efficient solutions.

Method: Leverages frozen diffusion model features, extracts low-level representations from early denoising timesteps, and integrates spectral-spatial info via a FiLM-based fusion module.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on hyperspectral datasets using sparse labels, with ablation studies validating diffusion-derived features and spectral fusion.

Conclusion: Pretrained diffusion models can enable domain-agnostic, label-efficient learning for remote sensing and scientific imaging.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) enables detailed land cover classification, yet low spatial resolution and sparse annotations pose significant challenges. We present a label-efficient framework that leverages spatial features from a frozen diffusion model pretrained on natural images. Our approach extracts low-level representations from high-resolution decoder layers at early denoising timesteps, which transfer effectively to the low-texture structure of HSI. To integrate spectral and spatial information, we introduce a lightweight FiLM-based fusion module that adaptively modulates frozen spatial features using spectral cues, enabling robust multimodal learning under sparse supervision. Experiments on two recent hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only the provided sparse training labels. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of diffusion-derived features and spectral-aware fusion. Overall, our results indicate that pretrained diffusion models can support domain-agnostic, label-efficient representation learning for remote sensing and broader scientific imaging tasks.

TL;DR: A novel VLP framework integrates MAGEN and O-MAKE to improve medical image-text pair quality and learning, achieving top zero-shot performance in dermatology tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLP methods struggle with noisy web data and complex long medical texts.

Method: Proposes MAGEN for enhanced data quality and O-MAKE for fine-grained alignment of unstructured texts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on disease classification and cross-modal retrieval across eight datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in medical VLP and will release augmented dataset and code.

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining (VLP) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in medical image analysis, enabling representation learning from large-scale image-text pairs without relying on expensive manual annotations. However, existing methods often struggle with the noise inherent in web-collected data and the complexity of unstructured long medical texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VLP framework integrating a Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system and Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining. First, MAGEN enhances data quality by synthesizing knowledge-enriched descriptions via a foundation model-assisted captioning and retrieval-based verification pipeline. Second, O-MAKE addresses the difficulty of learning from long, unstructured texts by decomposing them into distinct knowledge aspects. This facilitates fine-grained alignment at both global and patch levels, while explicitly modeling medical concept relationships through ontology-guided mechanisms. We validate our framework in the field of dermatology, where comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on disease classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks across eight datasets. Our code and the augmented dataset Derm1M-AgentAug, comprising over 400k skin-image-text pairs, will be released at https://github.com/SiyuanYan1/Derm1M.

*Tongxu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LM-CartSeg is an automatic pipeline for knee MRI segmentation and radiomics analysis, improving accuracy and stability across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robust, automatic ROIs for knee MRI radiomics and improve quality control.

Method: Trains 3D nnU-Net models, refines predictions with geometric rules, and evaluates segmentation and radiomics features.

Result: Significant improvement in segmentation accuracy (DSC 0.91) and stable L/M compartments; radiomics features showed discriminative potential.

Conclusion: LM-CartSeg offers a reliable, automated tool for knee OA radiomics studies, outperforming manual methods.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Radiomics of knee MRI requires robust, anatomically meaningful regions of interest (ROIs) that jointly capture cartilage and subchondral bone. Most existing work relies on manual ROIs and rarely reports quality control (QC). We present LM-CartSeg, a fully automatic pipeline for cartilage/bone segmentation, geometric lateral/medial (L/M) compartmentalisation and radiomics analysis. Methods: Two 3D nnU-Net models were trained on SKM-TEA (138 knees) and OAIZIB-CM (404 knees). At test time, zero-shot predictions were fused and refined by simple geometric rules: connected-component cleaning, construction of 10 mm subchondral bone bands in physical space, and a data-driven tibial L/M split based on PCA and k-means. Segmentation was evaluated on an OAIZIB-CM test set (103 knees) and on SKI-10 (100 knees). QC used volume and thickness signatures. From 10 ROIs we extracted 4 650 non-shape radiomic features to study inter-compartment similarity, dependence on ROI size, and OA vs. non-OA classification on OAIZIB-CM Results: Post-processing improved macro ASSD on OAIZIB-CM from 2.63 to 0.36 mm and HD95 from 25.2 to 3.35 mm, with DSC 0.91; zero-shot DSC on SKI-10 was 0.80. The geometric L/M rule produced stable compartments across datasets, whereas a direct L/M nnU-Net showed domain-dependent side swaps. Only 6 to 12 percent of features per ROI were strongly correlated with volume or thickness. Radiomics-based models models restricted to size-linked features. Conclusions: LM-CartSeg yields automatic, QCd ROIs and radiomic features that carry discriminative information beyond simple morphometry, providing a practical foundation for multi-centre knee OA radiomics studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in unsupervised keypoint methods for unconditional generative settings in 3D object representation.

Method: Learns spatially structured 3D keypoints from point clouds, conditioning an Elucidated Diffusion Model (EDM) for shape reconstruction.

Result: Keypoints show repeatable spatial structure and smooth interpolation, achieving a 6% improvement in consistency.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures geometric variation and enhances 3D generative pipelines.

Abstract: Understanding and representing the structure of 3D objects in an unsupervised manner remains a core challenge in computer vision and graphics. Most existing unsupervised keypoint methods are not designed for unconditional generative settings, restricting their use in modern 3D generative pipelines; our formulation explicitly bridges this gap. We present an unsupervised framework for learning spatially structured 3D keypoints from point cloud data. These keypoints serve as a compact and interpretable representation that conditions an Elucidated Diffusion Model (EDM) to reconstruct the full shape. The learned keypoints exhibit repeatable spatial structure across object instances and support smooth interpolation in keypoint space, indicating that they capture geometric variation. Our method achieves strong performance across diverse object categories, yielding a 6 percentage-point improvement in keypoint consistency compared to prior approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GalaxyDiT accelerates video generation by improving computational reuse and guidance alignment, achieving significant speedups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models like DiTs and CFG are computationally intensive, limiting their adoption despite superior performance.

Method: GalaxyDiT uses rank-order correlation analysis to select optimal proxies for reuse, ensuring efficient computation without training.

Result: Achieves 1.87×–2.37× speedup with <1% quality drop on VBench-2.0 and better PSNR than previous methods.

Conclusion: GalaxyDiT offers a training-free, efficient solution for high-quality video generation with significant computational savings.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, becoming essential tools in creative content generation and physical simulation. Transformer-based architectures (DiTs) and classifier-free guidance (CFG) are two cornerstones of this success, enabling strong prompt adherence and realistic video quality. Despite their versatility and superior performance, these models require intensive computation. Each video generation requires dozens of iterative steps, and CFG doubles the required compute. This inefficiency hinders broader adoption in downstream applications.
  We introduce GalaxyDiT, a training-free method to accelerate video generation with guidance alignment and systematic proxy selection for reuse metrics. Through rank-order correlation analysis, our technique identifies the optimal proxy for each video model, across model families and parameter scales, thereby ensuring optimal computational reuse. We achieve $1.87\times$ and $2.37\times$ speedup on Wan2.1-1.3B and Wan2.1-14B with only 0.97% and 0.72% drops on the VBench-2.0 benchmark. At high speedup rates, our approach maintains superior fidelity to the base model, exceeding prior state-of-the-art approaches by 5 to 10 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).

TL;DR: The paper introduces geometric regularization losses into video generation using depth prediction to enhance 3D structural consistency, improving temporal coherence and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods lack explicit 3D structure modeling, causing inconsistencies and artifacts. This work aims to bridge the gap between appearance generation and 3D modeling.

Method: The authors augment latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction and introduce a multi-view geometric loss to align depth maps across frames in a 3D coordinate system.

Result: Experiments show the method produces more stable and geometrically consistent videos compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating 3D geometric losses improves video generation quality by ensuring spatio-temporal coherence and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of high-quality and visually realistic clips using diffusion transformer models. However, most existing approaches operate purely in the 2D pixel space and lack explicit mechanisms for modeling 3D structures, often resulting in temporally inconsistent geometries, implausible motions, and structural artifacts. In this work, we introduce geometric regularization losses into video generation by augmenting latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction. We adopted depth as the geometric representation because of the great progress in depth prediction and its compatibility with image-based latent encoders. Specifically, to enforce structural consistency over time, we propose a multi-view geometric loss that aligns the predicted depth maps across frames within a shared 3D coordinate system. Our method bridges the gap between appearance generation and 3D structure modeling, leading to improved spatio-temporal coherence, shape consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our approach produces significantly more stable and geometrically consistent results than existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkDeeper is a framework for autonomous vehicles that improves visual grounding by reasoning about future spatial states using a Spatial-Aware World Model and hypergraph-guided decoding. It outperforms SOTA methods and shows robustness in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual grounding methods for autonomous vehicles struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions due to lack of reasoning over 3D spatial relations and future scene evolution.

Method: ThinkDeeper uses a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) to distill current scenes into command-aware latent states and predict future states. A hypergraph-guided decoder hierarchically fuses these states with multimodal inputs for robust localization.

Result: ThinkDeeper ranks #1 on Talk2Car and outperforms SOTA baselines on DrivePilot, MoCAD, and RefCOCO/+/g benchmarks. It shows strong robustness and efficiency, even with 50% training data.

Conclusion: ThinkDeeper's forward-looking reasoning and multimodal fusion enhance visual grounding in autonomous driving, demonstrating superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Interpreting natural-language commands to localize target objects is critical for autonomous driving (AD). Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization. In addition, we present DrivePilot, a multi-source VG dataset in AD, featuring semantic annotations generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-prompted LLM pipeline. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, ThinkDeeper ranks #1 on the Talk2Car leaderboard and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on DrivePilot, MoCAD, and RefCOCO/+/g benchmarks. Notably, it shows strong robustness and efficiency in challenging scenes (long-text, multi-agent, ambiguity) and retains superior performance even when trained on 50% of the data.

*Shojiro Yamabe,Futa Waseda,Daiki Shiono,Tsubasa Takahashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Text-Printed Image (TPI), a method to train vision-language models using only text, bridging the modality gap between text and images by rendering text on a white canvas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and privacy concerns of collecting large image-text pairs for fine-tuning LVLMs, leveraging widely available and editable text data instead.

Method: Introduces TPI, which renders textual descriptions onto plain white images to create synthetic training data, preserving text semantics without needing real images.

Result: TPI outperforms synthetic images from diffusion models across four models and seven benchmarks, proving effective for text-centric training and data augmentation.

Conclusion: TPI demonstrates the potential of text-centric training and automated data generation for LVLMs, offering scalability and cost-efficiency.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been applied to diverse VQA tasks. However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces lightweight modules (BDM, SD²M, SD³M, TD²M) for enhancing infrared small target detection by decomposing features, leading to networks SD²Net (SISTD) and STD²Net (MISTD) with SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in infrared small target detection (ISTD) like lack of target texture and background clutter by enhancing targets and suppressing backgrounds.

Method: Propose Basis Decomposition Module (BDM) and extend it to SD²M, SD³M, TD²M. Develop SD²Net for SISTD and STD²Net for MISTD using these modules in U-shaped architectures with motion information.

Result: SD²Net performs well on SISTD; STD²Net achieves mIoU of 87.68% on MISTD, outperforming SD²Net (64.97%).

Conclusion: The proposed modules and networks effectively enhance ISTD performance, achieving SOTA results.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) faces two major challenges: a lack of discernible target texture and severe background clutter, which results in the background obscuring the target. To enhance targets and suppress backgrounds, we propose the Basis Decomposition Module (BDM) as an extensible and lightweight module based on basis decomposition, which decomposes a complex feature into several basis features and enhances certain information while eliminating redundancy. Extending BDM leads to a series of modules, including the Spatial Difference Decomposition Module (SD$^\mathrm{2}$M), Spatial Difference Decomposition Downsampling Module (SD$^\mathrm{3}$M), and Temporal Difference Decomposition Module (TD$^\mathrm{2}$M). Based on these modules, we develop the Spatial Difference Decomposition Network (SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net) for single-frame ISTD (SISTD) and the Spatiotemporal Difference Decomposition Network (STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net) for multi-frame ISTD (MISTD). SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net integrates SD$^\mathrm{2}$M and SD$^\mathrm{3}$M within an adapted U-shaped architecture. We employ TD$^\mathrm{2}$M to introduce motion information, which transforms SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net into STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net. Extensive experiments on SISTD and MISTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. On the SISTD task, SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net performs well compared to most established networks. On the MISTD datasets, STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net achieves a mIoU of 87.68\%, outperforming SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net, which achieves a mIoU of 64.97\%.

### [32] [Procedural Mistake Detection via Action Effect Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03474)
*Wenliang Guo,Yujiang Pu,Yu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a framework that jointly analyzes action execution and outcomes for mistake detection in procedural tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus only on action execution, ignoring outcomes (action effects), which often reveal errors. This gap limits reliable mistake detection.

Method: AEM probabilistically models action execution and outcomes by selecting informative effect frames, combining visual and symbolic cues in a shared latent space, and using a prompt-based detector for alignment with intended semantics.

Result: AEM outperforms existing methods on EgoPER and CaptainCook4D benchmarks in one-class classification, showing improved mistake detection.

Conclusion: Modeling both execution and outcomes enhances mistake detection, and effect-aware representations have broader potential applications.

Abstract: Mistake detection in procedural tasks is essential for building intelligent systems that support learning and task execution. Existing approaches primarily analyze how an action is performed, while overlooking what it produces, i.e., the \textbf{action effect}. Yet many errors manifest not in the execution itself but in the resulting outcome, such as an unintended object state or incorrect spatial arrangement. To address this gap, we propose Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a unified framework that jointly captures action execution and its outcomes through a probabilistic formulation. AEM first identifies the outcome of an action by selecting the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality. It then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs, aligning them in a shared latent space to form robust effect-aware representations. To detect mistakes, we further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EgoPER and CaptainCook4D benchmarks under the challenging one-class classification (OCC) setting. These results demonstrate that modeling both execution and outcome yields more reliable mistake detection, and highlight the potential of effect-aware representations to benefit a broader range of downstream applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing diagnostic accuracy disparities across demographic groups in medical AI systems.

Method: Introduces differentiable MaxAccGap loss and three LoRA variants: FR-LoRA, GR-LoRA, and Hybrid-LoRA.

Result: GR-LoRA reduces disparities by 69% while maintaining 53.15% accuracy; requires only 0.24% trainable parameters.

Conclusion: Fairness-aware LoRA enables practical deployment of equitable medical AI with minimal resource usage.

Abstract: Vision-language models achieve expert-level performance on medical imaging tasks but exhibit significant diagnostic accuracy disparities across demographic groups. We introduce fairness-aware Low-Rank Adaptation for medical VLMs, combining parameter efficiency with explicit fairness optimization. Our key algorithmic contribution is a differentiable MaxAccGap loss that enables end-to-end optimization of accuracy parity across demographic groups. We propose three methods: FR-LoRA integrates MaxAccGap regularization into the training objective, GR-LoRA applies inverse frequency weighting to balance gradient contributions, and Hybrid-LoRA combines both mechanisms.Evaluated on 10,000 glaucoma fundus images, GR-LoRA reduces diagnostic accuracy disparities by 69% while maintaining 53.15% overall accuracy. Ablation studies reveal that strong regularization strength achieves optimal fairness with minimal accuracy trade-off, and race-specific optimization yields 60% disparity reduction. Our approach requires only 0.24% trainable parameters, enabling practical deployment of fair medical AI in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

TL;DR: The paper proposes shifting from action-centric to object-centric reasoning in procedural activities, introducing Object-IVQA for benchmarking and a framework for improved AI performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of action-centric methods in handling flexible procedural tasks by focusing on object states and transitions.

Method: Introduces Object-IVQA, a benchmark with videos and QA pairs, and an agent framework integrating object-centric planning, perception, analysis, and generation tools.

Result: Existing models struggle with object-level tasks, while the proposed framework shows significant improvement.

Conclusion: Object-centric reasoning enhances AI's ability to handle procedural tasks, with potential applications in assistive technologies.

Abstract: Understanding procedural activities is crucial for developing future assistive AI that can reason about complex real-world tasks. Existing action-centric methods struggle with the flexibility of real procedures, where step order varies depending on object states. In this work, we propose to shift the focus to an object-centric paradigm by regarding actions as mechanisms that drive state transitions. To advance this direction, we introduce Object-IVQA, a long-form instructional video benchmark with 107 videos and 514 open-ended question-answer pairs annotated with temporally grounded evidence. The benchmark evaluates four dimensions of object-centric reasoning, including state evolution, precondition verification, counterfactual reasoning and mistake recognition. We further propose an agent framework that orchestrates object-centric planning, perception, analysis and generation tools, enabling explicit evidence retrieval and multi-hop reasoning across disjoint segments. Experiments show that existing large vision-language models struggle in object-level recognition and reasoning, whereas our framework achieves substantially improvement.

TL;DR: NAS-LoRA enhances SAM's adaptation to specialized domains using Neural Architecture Search for dynamic optimization, reducing training costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM lacks spatial priors in its Transformer encoder, limiting high-level semantic learning. Adapting SAM efficiently for tasks like medical imaging is challenging.

Method: Proposes NAS-LoRA, integrating a lightweight NAS block between LoRA's encoder and decoder for dynamic prior optimization. Uses stage-wise optimization for balanced semantic learning.

Result: Improves PEFT methods, reduces training costs by 24.14%, and maintains inference efficiency.

Conclusion: NAS-LoRA effectively bridges SAM's semantic gap for specialized domains, showcasing NAS's role in enhancing PEFT for visual models.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful visual foundation model for image segmentation. However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EEA is a video agent framework that balances exploration and exploitation using semantic guidance and hierarchical tree search for efficient long-form video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for long-form video understanding are computationally heavy or inefficient in balancing exploration and exploitation, leading to incomplete coverage.

Method: EEA uses semantic guidance with hierarchical tree search, dynamically updating task-relevant semantic queries and prioritizing semantically relevant frames. It combines intrinsic rewards from VLMs with semantic priors.

Result: Experiments show EEA outperforms existing methods in performance and computational efficiency across long-video benchmarks.

Conclusion: EEA effectively balances exploration and exploitation, improving efficiency and coverage in long-form video understanding.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding requires efficient navigation of extensive visual data to pinpoint sparse yet critical information. Current approaches to longform video understanding either suffer from severe computational overhead due to dense preprocessing, or fail to effectively balance exploration and exploitation, resulting in incomplete information coverage and inefficiency. In this work, we introduce EEA, a novel video agent framework that archives exploration-exploitation balance through semantic guidance with hierarchical tree search process. EEA autonomously discovers and dynamically updates task-relevant semantic queries, and collects video frames closely matched to these queries as semantic anchors. During the tree search process, instead of uniform expansion, EEA preferentially explores semantically relevant frames while ensuring sufficient coverage within unknown segments. Moreover, EEA adaptively combines intrinsic rewards from visionlanguage models (VLMs) with semantic priors by explicitly modeling uncertainty to achieve stable and precise evaluation of video segments. Experiments across various long-video benchmarks validate the superior performance and computational efficiency of our proposed method.

*Seogkyu Jeon,Kibeom Hong,Hyeran Byun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel domain generalization framework, DPMFormer, addresses semantic misalignment in DGSS by using domain-aware prompts, contrastive learning, and consistency learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DGSS methods ignore semantic misalignment between visual and textual contexts due to fixed prompts, limiting performance.

Method: DPMFormer introduces domain-aware prompt learning, domain-aware contrastive learning with texture perturbation, and domain-robust consistency learning.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on various DGSS benchmarks.

Conclusion: DPMFormer effectively aligns visual and textual semantics and improves generalization across domains.

Abstract: Recent domain generalized semantic segmentation (DGSS) studies have achieved notable improvements by distilling semantic knowledge from Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, they overlook the semantic misalignment between visual and textual contexts, which arises due to the rigidity of a fixed context prompt learned on a single source domain. To this end, we present a novel domain generalization framework for semantic segmentation, namely Domain-aware Prompt-driven Masked Transformer (DPMFormer). Firstly, we introduce domain-aware prompt learning to facilitate semantic alignment between visual and textual cues. To capture various domain-specific properties with a single source dataset, we propose domain-aware contrastive learning along with the texture perturbation that diversifies the observable domains. Lastly, to establish a framework resilient against diverse environmental changes, we have proposed the domain-robust consistency learning which guides the model to minimize discrepancies of prediction from original and the augmented images. Through experiments and analyses, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which establishes a new state-of-the-art on various DGSS benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/jone1222/DPMFormer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computer vision-based framework for automated dance movement analysis using YOLOv8, v11, and SAM, achieving high precision in detection and segmentation for quantifying dance metrics like steps, spatial coverage, and rhythm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of automated dance movement analysis without specialized equipment or markers, leveraging modern computer vision techniques.

Method: The framework integrates YOLOv8 and v11 for dancer detection and SAM for segmentation, enabling tracking and quantification of dance movements in videos.

Result: The system achieved 94% detection precision, 89% recall, and 83% segmentation accuracy (IoU). Results showed the primary dancer executed 23% more steps, 37% higher motion intensity, and utilized 42% more space than secondary dancers.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates technical feasibility but acknowledges limitations like single-video validation and lack of ground truth comparisons, suggesting future systematic studies.

Abstract: This paper presents a preliminary investigation into automated dance movement analysis using contemporary computer vision techniques. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that integrates YOLOv8 and v11 for dancer detection with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise segmentation, enabling the tracking and quantification of dancer movements in video recordings without specialized equipment or markers. Our approach identifies dancers within video frames, counts discrete dance steps, calculates spatial coverage patterns, and measures rhythm consistency across performance sequences. Testing this framework on a single 49-second recording of Ghanaian AfroBeats dance demonstrates technical feasibility, with the system achieving approximately 94% detection precision and 89% recall on manually inspected samples. The pixel-level segmentation provided by SAM, achieving approximately 83% intersection-over-union with visual inspection, enables motion quantification that captures body configuration changes beyond what bounding-box approaches can represent. Analysis of this preliminary case study indicates that the dancer classified as primary by our system executed 23% more steps with 37% higher motion intensity and utilized 42% more performance space compared to dancers classified as secondary. However, this work represents an early-stage investigation with substantial limitations including single-video validation, absence of systematic ground truth annotations, and lack of comparison with existing pose estimation methods. We present this framework to demonstrate technical feasibility, identify promising directions for quantitative dance metrics, and establish a foundation for future systematic validation studies.

TL;DR: FloodDiffusion is a framework for real-time, text-driven human motion generation using a tailored diffusion forcing approach, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of chunk-by-chunk or auto-regressive methods in generating seamless, text-aligned human motion sequences with low latency.

Method: Uses a diffusion forcing framework enhanced with bi-directional attention, a lower triangular time scheduler, and continuous text conditioning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with an FID of 0.057 on HumanML3D benchmark.

Conclusion: The tailored diffusion forcing framework effectively models real motion distributions for streaming motion generation.

Abstract: We present FloodDiffusion, a new framework for text-driven, streaming human motion generation. Given time-varying text prompts, FloodDiffusion generates text-aligned, seamless motion sequences with real-time latency. Unlike existing methods that rely on chunk-by-chunk or auto-regressive model with diffusion head, we adopt a diffusion forcing framework to model this time-series generation task under time-varying control events. We find that a straightforward implementation of vanilla diffusion forcing (as proposed for video models) fails to model real motion distributions. We demonstrate that to guarantee modeling the output distribution, the vanilla diffusion forcing must be tailored to: (i) train with a bi-directional attention instead of casual attention; (ii) implement a lower triangular time scheduler instead of a random one; (iii) utilize a continues time-varying way to introduce text conditioning. With these improvements, we demonstrate in the first time that the diffusion forcing-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the streaming motion generation task, reaching an FID of 0.057 on the HumanML3D benchmark.

TL;DR: CartoMapQA is a benchmark evaluating LVLMs' map interpretation skills through QA tasks, revealing challenges like map-specific semantics and geospatial reasoning, aiming to improve real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LVLMs' ability to interpret cartographic maps, a largely unexplored area, to guide improvements for real-world uses like navigation and urban planning.

Method: Introduces CartoMapQA, a dataset with 2000 samples (maps, questions, answers) testing low- to high-level map skills (symbol recognition, route reasoning).

Result: Evaluations show LVLMs struggle with map semantics, geospatial reasoning, and OCR errors, highlighting persistent weaknesses.

Conclusion: CartoMapQA isolates LVLM weaknesses, offering a tool to enhance architectures for better map understanding in practical applications like navigation.

Abstract: The rise of Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) has unlocked new possibilities for seamlessly integrating visual and textual information. However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

TL;DR: OpenTrack3D is a novel framework for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that generalizes to mesh-free environments by using a visual-spatial tracker and MLLM for superior performance and compositional reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in mesh-free environments and struggle with compositional queries due to reliance on dataset-specific proposals and weak CLIP-based textual reasoning.

Method: OpenTrack3D uses a visual-spatial tracker to create consistent object proposals online, lifts 2D masks to 3D point clouds, and replaces CLIP with an MLLM for better textual reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like ScanNet200 and SceneFun3D, with strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: OpenTrack3D effectively addresses limitations of prior methods, offering accurate and generalizable 3D instance segmentation.

Abstract: Generalizing open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) to diverse, unstructured, and mesh-free environments is crucial for robotics and AR/VR, yet remains a significant challenge. We attribute this to two key limitations of existing methods: (1) proposal generation relies on dataset-specific proposal networks or mesh-based superpoints, rendering them inapplicable in mesh-free scenarios and limiting generalization to novel scenes; and (2) the weak textual reasoning of CLIP-based classifiers, which struggle to recognize compositional and functional user queries. To address these issues, we introduce OpenTrack3D, a generalizable and accurate framework. Unlike methods that rely on pre-generated proposals, OpenTrack3D employs a novel visual-spatial tracker to construct cross-view consistent object proposals online. Given an RGB-D stream, our pipeline first leverages a 2D open-vocabulary segmenter to generate masks, which are lifted to 3D point clouds using depth. Mask-guided instance features are then extracted using DINO feature maps, and our tracker fuses visual and spatial cues to maintain instance consistency. The core pipeline is entirely mesh-free, yet we also provide an optional superpoints refinement module to further enhance performance when scene mesh is available. Finally, we replace CLIP with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM), significantly enhancing compositional reasoning for complex user queries. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including ScanNet200, Replica, ScanNet++, and SceneFun3D, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepSeek-OCR's vision-based text compression is challenged by simpler methods, which outperform it in reconstruction and language modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether vision-based compression uniquely benefits text reconstruction and aids language modeling, challenging assumptions in the optical-compression narrative.

Method: Comparison of DeepSeek-OCR's vision encoder against simple alternatives (mean pooling and hierarchical encoder) at matched compression ratios.

Result: Simpler methods match or surpass vision-based compression for reconstruction and outperform it in language modeling, where vision fails to beat truncation.

Conclusion: Vision-based compression's advantages are overstated; simpler methods are more effective.

Abstract: DeepSeek-OCR demonstrates that rendered text can be reconstructed with high fidelity from a small number of vision tokens. This finding has sparked excitement about vision-based context compression for language models. But the evaluation stops at reconstruction; whether these representations help language modeling remains untested. We test two assumptions implicit in the optical-compression narrative: that vision-based compression provides unique advantages for text reconstruction from compressed representations, and that DeepSeek-OCR's reconstruction results are evidence that vision-based compression will be useful for language modeling. Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation. The excitement around optical context compression outpaces the evidence. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/ivnle/bad-autoencoding

TL;DR: PRIS is a framework that redesigns prompts during inference to improve text-to-visual generation by addressing recurring failures and using element-level factual correction for precise alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise alignment between user intent and generated visuals is challenging, and fixed prompts limit quality improvement through scaling.

Method: PRIS adaptively revises prompts based on failure patterns in generated visuals, using element-level factual correction for feedback.

Result: Experiments show PRIS achieves a 15% gain on VBench 2.0, demonstrating effectiveness in text-to-image and text-to-video tasks.

Conclusion: Jointly scaling prompts and visuals is essential for leveraging inference-time scaling laws effectively.

Abstract: Achieving precise alignment between user intent and generated visuals remains a central challenge in text-to-visual generation, as a single attempt often fails to produce the desired output. To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0. These results highlight that jointly scaling prompts and visuals is key to fully leveraging scaling laws at inference-time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are brittle under simple orientation changes or corruptions, highlighting the need for robust tool-based reasoning beyond fixed tool registries.

Method: Proposes CodeVision, a framework using code as tools, trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a dense process reward function.

Result: Improves performance on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series, enabling flexible tool composition, efficient execution, and robust error recovery.

Conclusion: CodeVision addresses MLLM brittleness and scales tool use effectively, introducing datasets and benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that think with images can interactively use tools to reason about visual inputs, but current approaches often rely on a narrow set of tools with limited real-world necessity and scalability. In this work, we first reveal a critical and previously overlooked weakness: even state-of-the-art MLLMs are surprisingly brittle, showing significant performance degradation on images with simple orientation changes or natural corruptions, underscoring the need for more robust tool-based reasoning. To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries. We train our model using a two-stage methodology, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a high-quality dataset curated for complex, multi-turn tool composition and error recovery, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel and dense process reward function to encourage strategic and efficient tool use. To facilitate this research, we construct new SFT and RL datasets and introduce a challenging new benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate robustness to orientation changes and multi-tool reasoning. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series show that our approach significantly improves model performance and fosters emergent capabilities such as flexible tool composition, efficient chained execution, and robust error recovery from runtime feedback.

TL;DR: CookAnything is a diffusion-based framework for generating coherent, adaptable image sequences from cooking instructions, addressing limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with multi-step scenarios like recipe illustration and lack adaptability to variable instruction lengths.

Method: CookAnything introduces Step-wise Regional Control (SRC), Flexible RoPE positional encoding, and Cross-Step Consistency Control (CSCC) for flexible and consistent image generation.

Result: Benchmark tests show CookAnything outperforms existing methods in training-based and training-free settings.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, high-quality visual synthesis for complex instructions, with potential applications in instructional media and procedural content creation.

Abstract: Cooking is a sequential and visually grounded activity, where each step such as chopping, mixing, or frying carries both procedural logic and visual semantics. While recent diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, they struggle to handle structured multi-step scenarios like recipe illustration. Additionally, current recipe illustration methods are unable to adjust to the natural variability in recipe length, generating a fixed number of images regardless of the actual instructions structure. To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length. The framework introduces three key components: (1) Step-wise Regional Control (SRC), which aligns textual steps with corresponding image regions within a single denoising process; (2) Flexible RoPE, a step-aware positional encoding mechanism that enhances both temporal coherence and spatial diversity; and (3) Cross-Step Consistency Control (CSCC), which maintains fine-grained ingredient consistency across steps. Experimental results on recipe illustration benchmarks show that CookAnything performs better than existing methods in training-based and training-free settings. The proposed framework supports scalable, high-quality visual synthesis of complex multi-step instructions and holds significant potential for broad applications in instructional media, and procedural content creation.

TL;DR: AdaptVision is an efficient Vision-Language Model paradigm that adaptively minimizes visual tokens using a coarse-to-fine approach and reinforcement learning, achieving better performance with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs rely on excessive visual tokens passively, lacking adaptability to varying task needs, prompting the need for autonomous token reduction.

Method: AdaptVision uses low-resolution images initially and selectively crops key regions via a bounding box tool, trained with Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO) balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Result: AdaptVision outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs in benchmarks while using significantly fewer visual tokens.

Conclusion: The adaptive token acquisition approach in AdaptVision enhances efficiency and performance, proving effective for vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in visual question answering tasks, but their reliance on large numbers of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods.

*Nan Sun,Zhenyu Zhang,Xixun Lin,Kun Wang,Yanmin Shang,Naibin Gu,Shuohuan Wang,Yu Sun,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang,Yanan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-ITI is a framework detecting and addressing visual neglect in MLLMs to reduce hallucinations without over-intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from hallucinations due to visual neglect; existing methods over-intervene, introducing new issues.

Method: Introduces V-ITI, using head-level activation patterns to detect neglect and intervene only when necessary.

Result: V-ITI reduces hallucinations across benchmarks without harming general performance.

Conclusion: Targeted intervention alleviates hallucinations efficiently.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in numerous vision-language tasks yet suffer from hallucinations, producing content inconsistent with input visuals, that undermine reliability in precision-sensitive domains. This issue stems from a fundamental problem of visual neglect, where models fail to adequately prioritize input images. Existing methods typically alleviate hallucinations by intervening in the attention score or output logits, focusing on "how to intervene" but overlooking the prerequisite "when to intervene", which leads to the "over-intervention" problem and subsequently introduces new hallucinations and unnecessary computational overhead. To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks and different MLLM families demonstrate that V-ITI consistently mitigates vision-related hallucinations while preserving general task performance.

*Sen Fang,Yalin Feng,Hongbin Zhong,Yanxin Zhang,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stable Signer, a streamlined hierarchical end-to-end model for Sign Language Production (SLP) that improves accuracy and efficiency by focusing on text understanding and pose-to-video generation, leveraging SLUL and SLP-MoE blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLP methods suffer from gradual error accumulation due to inaccuracies in text conversion, pose generation, and video rendering. The paper aims to simplify and optimize the task by reducing redundant stages.

Method: The model redefines SLP as a hierarchical end-to-end task with text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid stages. It uses SLUL for text understanding and SLP-MoE for hand gesture rendering. SLUL is trained with SAGM Loss.

Result: Stable Signer achieves a 48.6% performance improvement over state-of-the-art SLP generation methods.

Conclusion: The streamlined hierarchical approach with SLUL and SLP-MoE effectively enhances SLP accuracy and quality, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the process of converting the complex input text into a real video. Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos. SLUL is trained using the newly developed Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss (SAGM Loss). Its performance has improved by 48.6% compared to the current SOTA generation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of timely, multimodal, and robust content moderation in livestreaming environments, especially for novel or subtle violations.

Method: Deploy a hybrid framework integrating supervised classification for known violations and reference-based similarity matching for novel cases, enhanced by multimodal large language models.

Result: Achieves 67% recall at 80% precision for classification and 76% recall at 80% precision for similarity matching, reducing unwanted livestream views by 6-8%.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework offers scalable and adaptable multimodal content governance, effectively tackling explicit violations and emerging adversarial behaviors.

Abstract: Content moderation remains a critical yet challenging task for large-scale user-generated video platforms, especially in livestreaming environments where moderation must be timely, multimodal, and robust to evolving forms of unwanted content. We present a hybrid moderation framework deployed at production scale that combines supervised classification for known violations with reference-based similarity matching for novel or subtle cases. This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight. In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision. Large-scale A/B tests show a 6-8% reduction in user views of unwanted livestreams}. These results demonstrate a scalable and adaptable approach to multimodal content governance, capable of addressing both explicit violations and emerging adversarial behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and 3D articulated object representations, which existing models fail to address.

Method: Fine-tune a point cloud model for coarse object generation, refine using hypergraph learning (parts as vertices), and generate joints (edges) via diffusion models.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated on the PartNet-Mobility dataset through qualitative and quantitative experiments.

Conclusion: GAOT effectively generates articulated objects from text prompts, advancing the field beyond current limitations.

Abstract: Articulated object generation has seen increasing advancements, yet existing models often lack the ability to be conditioned on text prompts. To address the significant gap between textual descriptions and 3D articulated object representations, we propose GAOT, a three-phase framework that generates articulated objects from text prompts, leveraging diffusion models and hypergraph learning in a three-step process. First, we fine-tune a point cloud generation model to produce a coarse representation of objects from text prompts. Given the inherent connection between articulated objects and graph structures, we design a hypergraph-based learning method to refine these coarse representations, representing object parts as graph vertices. Finally, leveraging a diffusion model, the joints of articulated objects-represented as graph edges-are generated based on the object parts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the PartNet-Mobility dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior performance over previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLASTE, an end-to-end framework for Scene Text Editing (STE) that addresses inconsistency and length-insensitivity issues by combining global and local features, yielding superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STE methods struggle with maintaining coherence and handling text length variations, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: GLASTE integrates global-local contextual information, uses joint losses, and enhances text image features. It represents text style as a size-independent vector and employs affine fusion.

Result: Experiments show GLASTE outperforms prior methods in consistency and handling text length changes.

Conclusion: GLASTE effectively addresses STE challenges, validated by real-world dataset performance.

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) involves replacing text in a scene image with new target text while preserving both the original text style and background texture. Existing methods suffer from two major challenges: inconsistency and length-insensitivity. They often fail to maintain coherence between the edited local patch and the surrounding area, and they struggle to handle significant differences in text length before and after editing. To tackle these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework called Global-Local Aware Scene Text Editing (GLASTE), which simultaneously incorporates high-level global contextual information along with delicate local features. Specifically, we design a global-local combination structure, joint global and local losses, and enhance text image features to ensure consistency in text style within local patches while maintaining harmony between local and global areas. Additionally, we express the text style as a vector independent of the image size, which can be transferred to target text images of various sizes. We use an affine fusion to fill target text images into the editing patch while maintaining their aspect ratio unchanged. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that our GLASTE model outperforms previous methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative results and effectively mitigates the two challenges.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniComp is a video compression framework driven by information uniqueness, optimizing token retention under computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance video compression by maximizing information fidelity through minimizing reconstruction error, leveraging information uniqueness.

Method: Introduces three modules: Frame Group Fusion, Token Allocation, and Spatial Dynamic Compression for semantic grouping and adaptive compression.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in preserving essential visual tokens within limited computational budgets.

Conclusion: Information uniqueness is crucial for effective token compression, as demonstrated by UniComp's superior performance.

Abstract: Distinct from attention-based compression methods, this paper presents an information uniqueness driven video compression framework, termed UniComp, which aims to maximize the information fidelity of video representations under constrained computational budgets. Starting from the information-theoretic perspective, we formulate the vision compression as an optimization problem that minimizes conditional entropy (reconstruction error) between retained and full tokens. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of information uniqueness to measure intrinsic redundancy among tokens to link with reconstruction error. Based on uniqueness, we design three modules-Frame Group Fusion, Token Allocation, and Spatial Dynamic Compression-that progressively perform semantic frame grouping, adaptive resource allocation, and fine-grained spatial compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniComp consistently outperforms existing compression methods in preserving essential visual tokens under limited computational budgets, highlighting the pivotal role of information uniqueness in token compression efficacy.

*Yizhi Zhang,Lei Fan,Zhulin Tao,Donglin Di,Yang Song,Sidong Liu,Cong Cong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a method leveraging a multi-stain dataset to improve H&E slide representations by aligning features with IHC biomarkers, enhancing performance in computational pathology tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of aligned multi-stain datasets limits the enrichment of H&E-based features with biologically meaningful IHC data, necessitating better alignment methods for robust representations.

Method: CSCL uses a two-stage pretraining framework: patch-wise contrastive alignment and slide-level representation learning with MIL, integrating stain-specific features and enforcing slide-level consistency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved performance in cancer classification, biomarker status prediction, and survival analysis, yielding transferable H&E representations.

Conclusion: CSCL addresses inter-stain misalignment challenges, producing high-quality, transferable WSI representations for computational pathology.

Abstract: Universal, transferable whole-slide image (WSI) representations are central to computational pathology. Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOT-BI uses motion perception to distinguish humans from bots in surveys, tested successfully with high human accuracy and low bot success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a simple, effective method to differentiate between human respondents and automated systems in online processes, leveraging human perceptual abilities.

Method: DOT-BI displays a hidden number with a random black-and-white pixel texture background, perceptible to humans due to motion and scale differences but not detectable by bots.

Result: State-of-the-art models failed to extract the hidden number. Online surveys showed 99.5% human success with quick completion times, and lab tests confirmed no usability issues.

Conclusion: DOT-BI is a promising, human-friendly solution for bot identification in online processes, supported by preliminary successful tests and released tools for adoption.

Abstract: We propose the Dynamic Optical Test for Bot Identification (DOT-BI): a quick and easy method that uses human perception of motion to differentiate between human respondents and automated systems in surveys and online processes. In DOT-BI, a 'hidden' number is displayed with the same random black-and-white pixel texture as its background. Only the difference in motion and scale between the number and the background makes the number perceptible to humans across frames, while frame-by-frame algorithmic processing yields no meaningful signal. We conducted two preliminary assessments. Firstly, state-of-the-art, video-capable, multimodal models (GPT-5-Thinking and Gemini 2.5 Pro) fail to extract the correct value, even when given explicit instructions about the mechanism. Secondly, in an online survey (n=182), 99.5% (181/182) of participants solved the task, with an average end-to-end completion time of 10.7 seconds; a supervised lab study (n=39) found no negative effects on perceived ease-of-use or completion time relative to a control. We release code to generate tests and 100+ pre-rendered variants to facilitate adoption in surveys and online processes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BBF introduces a context-aware video frame interpolation framework guided by audio/visual semantics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by flexibly handling multiple conditional modalities and employing a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based video frame interpolation methods struggle with diverse scenarios and fail in fine-grained tasks like audio-visual synchronized interpolation.

Method: BBF enhances input design for multiple modalities, uses a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism with a DiT backbone, and adopts progressive multi-stage training with dynamic adjustments.

Result: BBF outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods in both generic and audio-visual synchronized interpolation tasks.

Conclusion: BBF establishes a unified framework for video frame interpolation under multi-channel conditioning, improving performance and versatility.

Abstract: Handling fast, complex, and highly non-linear motion patterns has long posed challenges for video frame interpolation. Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BBF outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods on both generic interpolation and audio-visual synchronized interpolation tasks, establishing a unified framework for video frame interpolation under coordinated multi-channel conditioning.

TL;DR: HyperRNA is a generative model using hypergraphs and an encoder-decoder architecture to solve the RNA inverse folding problem, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The RNA inverse folding problem is complex due to the intricate sequence-structure relationship, requiring innovative solutions for accurate RNA design.

Method: HyperRNA uses preprocessing (3-bead coarse-grained representation), encoding (attention and hypergraph-based encoder), and decoding (autoregressive sequence generation).

Result: Experiments on PDBBind and RNAsolo show HyperRNA outperforms existing RNA design methods.

Conclusion: HyperRNA demonstrates the potential of hypergraphs in RNA engineering, offering improved RNA sequence generation.

Abstract: The RNA inverse folding problem, a key challenge in RNA design, involves identifying nucleotide sequences that can fold into desired secondary structures, which are critical for ensuring molecular stability and function. The inherent complexity of this task stems from the intricate relationship between sequence and structure, making it particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework, named HyperRNA, a generative model with an encoder-decoder architecture that leverages hypergraphs to design RNA sequences. Specifically, our HyperRNA model consists of three main components: preprocessing, encoding and decoding.
  In the preprocessing stage, graph structures are constructed by extracting the atom coordinates of RNA backbone based on 3-bead coarse-grained representation. The encoding stage processes these graphs, capturing higher order dependencies and complex biomolecular interactions using an attention embedding module and a hypergraph-based encoder. Finally, the decoding stage generates the RNA sequence in an autoregressive manner. We conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments on the PDBBind and RNAsolo datasets to evaluate the inverse folding task for RNA sequence generation and RNA-protein complex sequence generation. The experimental results demonstrate that HyperRNA not only outperforms existing RNA design methods but also highlights the potential of leveraging hypergraphs in RNA engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of rendering articulated human avatars realistically across a wide range of camera motions, particularly focusing on maintaining quality for close-up views.

Method: CloseUpAvatar represents avatars with textured planes featuring two sets of learnable textures (low and high-frequency). It dynamically switches textures based on camera distance, optimizing rendering quality.

Result: Experiments on the ActorsHQ dataset show CloseUpAvatar outperforms existing methods in rendering quality for novel camera positions while maintaining high FPS.

Conclusion: CloseUpAvatar effectively balances rendering quality and performance, enabling realistic avatar representation across varying camera distances without excessive computational cost.

Abstract: We present a CloseUpAvatar - a novel approach for articulated human avatar representation dealing with more general camera motions, while preserving rendering quality for close-up views. CloseUpAvatar represents an avatar as a set of textured planes with two sets of learnable textures for low and high-frequency detail. The method automatically switches to high-frequency textures only for cameras positioned close to the avatar's surface and gradually reduces their impact as the camera moves farther away. Such parametrization of the avatar enables CloseUpAvatar to adjust rendering quality based on camera distance ensuring realistic rendering across a wider range of camera orientations than previous approaches. We provide experiments using the ActorsHQ dataset with high-resolution input images. CloseUpAvatar demonstrates both qualitative and quantitative improvements over existing methods in rendering from novel wide range camera positions, while maintaining high FPS by limiting the number of required primitives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of localized attention mechanisms in Vision Transformers for fusing local details with global context in medical image segmentation.

Method: Proposes HBFormer with a Hybrid-Bridge design, integrating U-shaped encoder-decoder and Swin Transformer. Features MFF decoder for multi-scale and contextual fusion using channel and spatial attention modules.

Result: Outperforms benchmarks on multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor datasets, excelling in microtumor and miniature organ segmentation.

Conclusion: HBFormer sets new benchmarks in medical image segmentation with its innovative architecture and feature fusion capabilities.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a cornerstone of modern clinical diagnostics. While Vision Transformers that leverage shifted window-based self-attention have established new benchmarks in this field, they are often hampered by a critical limitation: their localized attention mechanism struggles to effectively fuse local details with global context. This deficiency is particularly detrimental to challenging tasks such as the segmentation of microtumors and miniature organs, where both fine-grained boundary definition and broad contextual understanding are paramount. To address this gap, we propose HBFormer, a novel Hybrid-Bridge Transformer architecture. The 'Hybrid' design of HBFormer synergizes a classic U-shaped encoder-decoder framework with a powerful Swin Transformer backbone for robust hierarchical feature extraction. The core innovation lies in its 'Bridge' mechanism, a sophisticated nexus for multi-scale feature integration. This bridge is architecturally embodied by our novel Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) decoder. Departing from conventional symmetric designs, the MFF decoder is engineered to fuse multi-scale features from the encoder with global contextual information. It achieves this through a synergistic combination of channel and spatial attention modules, which are constructed from a series of dilated and depth-wise convolutions. These components work in concert to create a powerful feature bridge that explicitly captures long-range dependencies and refines object boundaries with exceptional precision. Comprehensive experiments on challenging medical image segmentation datasets, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor benchmarks, demonstrate that HBFormer achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its outstanding capabilities in microtumor and miniature organ segmentation.

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented framework improves dental point-cloud completion by integrating a prototype memory into encoder-decoder pipelines, enhancing accuracy and detail recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial dental point clouds often have large missing regions due to occlusion or limited scanning, leading to biased global features and unreliable decoder outputs.

Method: The proposed framework retrieves and fuses the nearest manifold prototype from a learnable memory with the query feature using confidence-gated weighting before decoding.

Result: Experiments show improved Chamfer Distance metrics and visual enhancements like sharper cusps and ridges without needing tooth-position labels.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages cross-sample regularities for accurate and faithful dental point-cloud completion.

Abstract: Partial dental point clouds often suffer from large missing regions caused by occlusion and limited scanning views, which bias encoder-only global features and force decoders to hallucinate structures. We propose a retrieval-augmented framework for tooth completion that integrates a prototype memory into standard encoder--decoder pipelines. After encoding a partial input into a global descriptor, the model retrieves the nearest manifold prototype from a learnable memory and fuses it with the query feature through confidence-gated weighting before decoding. The memory is optimized end-to-end and self-organizes into reusable tooth-shape prototypes without requiring tooth-position labels, thereby providing structural priors that stabilize missing-region inference and free decoder capacity for detail recovery. The module is plug-and-play and compatible with common completion backbones, while keeping the same training losses. Experiments on a self-processed Teeth3DS benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements in Chamfer Distance, with visualizations showing sharper cusps, ridges, and interproximal transitions. Our approach provides a simple yet effective way to exploit cross-sample regularities for more accurate and faithful dental point-cloud completion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D foundation models lack 3D consistency, causing spatial misalignment and temporal flickering in complex environments. Motion4D aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses a two-part iterative optimization framework (sequential and global) with a 3D confidence map and adaptive resampling. Enhances semantics via iterative refinement.

Result: Outperforms 2D foundation models and 3D-based approaches in tasks like tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: Motion4D effectively integrates 2D priors into a 4D framework, achieving superior performance in dynamic scene analysis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for 2D vision have substantially improved the analysis of dynamic scenes from monocular videos. However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, these models often lack 3D consistency, a fundamental requirement for understanding scene geometry and motion, thereby causing severe spatial misalignment and temporal flickering in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present Motion4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating 2D priors from foundation models into a unified 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our method features a two-part iterative optimization framework: 1) Sequential optimization, which updates motion and semantic fields in consecutive stages to maintain local consistency, and 2) Global optimization, which jointly refines all attributes for long-term coherence. To enhance motion accuracy, we introduce a 3D confidence map that dynamically adjusts the motion priors, and an adaptive resampling process that inserts new Gaussians into under-represented regions based on per-pixel RGB and semantic errors. Furthermore, we enhance semantic coherence through an iterative refinement process that resolves semantic inconsistencies by alternately optimizing the semantic fields and updating prompts of SAM2. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our Motion4D significantly outperforms both 2D foundation models and existing 3D-based approaches across diverse scene understanding tasks, including point-based tracking, video object segmentation, and novel view synthesis.

TL;DR: LAMP uses LLMs to convert natural language into 3D motion trajectories for objects and cameras, improving motion control in video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interfaces for motion control in video generation are limited; LAMP aims to enhance controllability by leveraging LLMs.

Method: LAMP employs a motion DSL and LLMs to translate natural language into structured motion programs, mapped deterministically to 3D trajectories.

Result: LAMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in motion controllability and alignment with user intent.

Conclusion: LAMP introduces a novel framework for generating object and camera motions directly from natural language, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress in visual fidelity and controllability, enabling conditioning on text, layout, or motion. Among these, motion control - specifying object dynamics and camera trajectories - is essential for composing complex, cinematic scenes, yet existing interfaces remain limited. We introduce LAMP that leverages large language models (LLMs) as motion planners to translate natural language descriptions into explicit 3D trajectories for dynamic objects and (relatively defined) cameras. LAMP defines a motion domain-specific language (DSL), inspired by cinematography conventions. By harnessing program synthesis capabilities of LLMs, LAMP generates structured motion programs from natural language, which are deterministically mapped to 3D trajectories. We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories. Experiments demonstrate LAMP's improved performance in motion controllability and alignment with user intent compared to state-of-the-art alternatives establishing the first framework for generating both object and camera motions directly from natural language specifications.

*Yaokun Li,Shuaixian Wang,Mantang Guo,Jiehui Huang,Taojun Ding,Mu Hu,Kaixuan Wang,Shaojie Shen,Guang Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCamDriving is a vision-based framework for generating novel-trajectory videos using dense 3DGS renderings for precise camera control. It employs a two-stage training paradigm and a data curation strategy to enhance scalability and performance, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like repair-based or LiDAR-based approaches struggle with complex artifacts or rely on sparse data, prompting the need for a vision-based solution with better geometric guidance.

Method: ReCamDriving uses dense 3DGS renderings for explicit geometric guidance, adopting a two-stage training paradigm (coarse camera control first, then fine-grained guidance). It also includes a 3DGS-based data curation strategy to address train-test gaps.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art camera controllability and structural consistency, demonstrated through extensive experiments on the ParaDrive dataset (110K+ parallel-trajectory video pairs).

Conclusion: ReCamDriving successfully addresses limitations of prior methods by leveraging dense 3DGS renderings and innovative training strategies, offering scalable and precise camera-controllable video generation.

Abstract: We propose ReCamDriving, a purely vision-based, camera-controlled novel-trajectory video generation framework. While repair-based methods fail to restore complex artifacts and LiDAR-based approaches rely on sparse and incomplete cues, ReCamDriving leverages dense and scene-complete 3DGS renderings for explicit geometric guidance, achieving precise camera-controllable generation. To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCamDriving achieves state-of-the-art camera controllability and structural consistency.

*Jiahao Zhang,Xiao Zhao,Guangyu Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MKSNet introduces a Multi-Kernel Selection mechanism and dual attention modules to improve small object detection in remote sensing imagery, outperforming state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in detecting small objects in high-resolution remote sensing images due to information loss in deep CNN layers and spatial redundancy.

Method: Proposes MKSNet with Multi-Kernel Selection for contextual capture and dual attention (spatial and channel) for feature optimization.

Result: MKSNet significantly outperforms existing models on DOTA-v1.0 and HRSC2016 benchmarks.

Conclusion: MKSNet effectively addresses small object detection challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating superior performance and innovation.

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have substantially advanced object detection capabilities, particularly in remote sensing imagery. However, challenges persist, especially in detecting small objects where the high resolution of these images and the small size of target objects often result in a loss of critical information in the deeper layers of conventional CNNs. Additionally, the extensive spatial redundancy and intricate background details typical in remote-sensing images tend to obscure these small targets. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Kernel Selection Network (MKSNet), a novel network architecture featuring a novel Multi-Kernel Selection mechanism. The MKS mechanism utilizes large convolutional kernels to effectively capture an extensive range of contextual information. This innovative design allows for adaptive kernel size selection, significantly enhancing the network's ability to dynamically process and emphasize crucial spatial details for small object detection. Furthermore, MKSNet also incorporates a dual attention mechanism, merging spatial and channel attention modules. The spatial attention module adaptively fine-tunes the spatial weights of feature maps, focusing more intensively on relevant regions while mitigating background noise. Simultaneously, the channel attention module optimizes channel information selection, improving feature representation and detection accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the DOTA-v1.0 and HRSC2016 benchmark demonstrate that MKSNet substantially surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in detecting small objects in remote sensing images. These results highlight MKSNet's superior ability to manage the complexities associated with multi-scale and high-resolution image data, confirming its effectiveness and innovation in remote sensing object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSVP introduces a lightweight, multi-scale prompting module for small-image benchmarks, improving performance across CNNs and Vision Transformers with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of attention given to prompting techniques in small-image benchmarks like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, which are widely used in education and research.

Method: Develops Multi-Scale Visual Prompting (MSVP), a backbone-agnostic module that learns and fuses global, mid-scale, and local prompt maps with input images using a lightweight 1×1 convolution.

Result: MSVP significantly improves performance across various backbones (CNN and Vision Transformer) with less than 0.02% additional parameters and negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: Multi-scale prompting effectively provides an inductive bias for low-resolution images, making MSVP a versatile and efficient solution for small-image benchmarks.

Abstract: Visual prompting has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to adapt vision models using lightweight, learnable parameters injected into the input space. However, prior work mainly targets large Vision Transformers and high-resolution datasets such as ImageNet. In contrast, small-image benchmarks like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 remain widely used in education, prototyping, and research, yet have received little attention in the context of prompting. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Scale Visual Prompting (MSVP)}, a simple and generic module that learns a set of global, mid-scale, and local prompt maps fused with the input image via a lightweight $1 \times 1$ convolution. MSVP is backbone-agnostic, adds less than $0.02\%$ parameters, and significantly improves performance across CNN and Vision Transformer backbones.
  We provide a unified benchmark on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 using a simple CNN, ResNet-18, and a small Vision Transformer. Our method yields consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. We further include ablations on prompt scales, fusion strategies, and backbone architectures, along with qualitative analyzes using prompt visualizations and Grad-CAM. Our results demonstrate that multi-scale prompting provides an effective inductive bias even on low-resolution images.

*Qi'ao Xu,Tianwen Qian,Yuqian Fu,Kailing Li,Yang Jiao,Jiacheng Zhang,Xiaoling Wang,Liang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToG-Bench introduces a task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos, addressing gaps in existing methods by focusing on task-oriented reasoning, explicit-implicit dual grounding, and one-to-many grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STVG studies lack task-oriented reasoning, which is crucial for embodied agents. ToG-Bench aims to bridge this gap by introducing a benchmark that emphasizes task-driven interactions.

Method: ToG-Bench is built on ScanNet videos, featuring 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented instructions. It uses a semi-automated pipeline combining foundation models and human refinement.

Result: Benchmarking seven MLLMs reveals challenges in task-oriented STVG, with performance gaps in explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding.

Conclusion: ToG-Bench highlights the difficulty of integrating perception and interaction in embodied scenarios, offering a valuable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: A core capability towards general embodied intelligence lies in localizing task-relevant objects from an egocentric perspective, formulated as Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG). Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Colon-X introduces ColonVQA, a comprehensive multimodal dataset for colonoscopy, and ColonReason, a reasoning-focused dataset, along with ColonR1, an advanced model outperforming benchmarks in clinical reasoning under data-scarce conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance multimodal intelligence in colonoscopy by bridging the gap between multimodal understanding and clinical reasoning.

Method: Constructs ColonVQA (1.1M+ entries) and ColonReason datasets, evaluates 22 MLLMs, and develops ColonR1 with task-adaptive rewarding and gradient-stable optimization.

Result: ColonR1 achieves 56.61% accuracy, surpassing supervised fine-tuning by 25.22%, setting a new baseline for multimodal colonoscopy analysis.

Conclusion: Colon-X provides robust datasets and models for advancing multimodal colonoscopy intelligence, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: In this study, we present Colon-X, an open initiative aimed at advancing multimodal intelligence in colonoscopy. We begin by constructing ColonVQA, the most comprehensive multimodal dataset ever built for colonoscopy, featuring over 1.1M+ visual question answering entries across 76 clinical findings and 18 multimodal tasks. Beyond serving as a community-wide data foundation, we further investigate a critical yet underexplored transition in colonoscopy - evolving from multimodal understanding to clinical reasoning: (a) To capture the current landscape of multimodal understanding behaviors, we systematically assess the generalizability of 22 multimodal large language models and examine their reliability under human-induced perturbations. The results reveal that clinical outputs from leading MLLMs remain far from robust and trustworthy. (b) To narrow this gap, we further explore reasoning-centric intelligence tailored for colonoscopy. Specifically, we curate ColonReason, a clinically grounded reasoning dataset annotated through a multi-expert debating pipeline, and develop ColonR1, the first R1-styled model incorporating task-adaptive rewarding and gradient-stable optimization techniques. Under data-scarce conditions, our ColonR1 achieves 56.61% overall accuracy, outperforming supervised fine-tuning by 25.22%, and sets a new reasoning-enabled baseline for multimodal colonoscopy analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConvRot introduces group-wise rotation-based quantization using RHT to reduce memory and latency in diffusion transformers, achieving W4A4 inference without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of growing memory footprint and inference latency in diffusion transformers as model sizes increase.

Method: Proposes ConvRot, a quantization method leveraging RHT to suppress outliers and reduce complexity, and ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module for efficient W4A4 inference.

Result: Achieves a 2.26× speedup and 4.05× memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity on FLUX.1-dev.

Conclusion: ConvRot enables efficient W4A4 inference in diffusion transformers without compromising quality, marking a first in rotation-based quantization applications.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating high-quality images. However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\times$ speedup and 4.05$\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity. To our knowledge, this is the first application of rotation-based quantization for plug-and-play W4A4 inference in diffusion transformers.

TL;DR: GaussianBlender introduces a feed-forward framework for instant, high-fidelity, and multi-view consistent text-driven 3D stylization, overcoming limitations of existing per-asset optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for scalable and efficient 3D stylization methods in game development, virtual reality, and digital arts drives the need for frameworks that avoid time-intensive per-asset optimization and multi-view inconsistencies.

Method: GaussianBlender learns structured, disentangled latent spaces from spatially-grouped 3D Gaussians and uses a latent diffusion model for text-conditioned edits.

Result: The framework delivers instant, geometry-preserving, and multi-view consistent stylization, outperforming methods requiring per-instance optimization.

Conclusion: GaussianBlender enables practical, democratized 3D stylization at scale, surpassing existing limitations.

Abstract: 3D stylization is central to game development, virtual reality, and digital arts, where the demand for diverse assets calls for scalable methods that support fast, high-fidelity manipulation. Existing text-to-3D stylization methods typically distill from 2D image editors, requiring time-intensive per-asset optimization and exhibiting multi-view inconsistency due to the limitations of current text-to-image models, which makes them impractical for large-scale production. In this paper, we introduce GaussianBlender, a pioneering feed-forward framework for text-driven 3D stylization that performs edits instantly at inference. Our method learns structured, disentangled latent spaces with controlled information sharing for geometry and appearance from spatially-grouped 3D Gaussians. A latent diffusion model then applies text-conditioned edits on these learned representations. Comprehensive evaluations show that GaussianBlender not only delivers instant, high-fidelity, geometry-preserving, multi-view consistent stylization, but also surpasses methods that require per-instance test-time optimization - unlocking practical, democratized 3D stylization at scale.

TL;DR: The paper discusses active visual perception, emphasizing its dynamic interaction with environments to enhance sensing and address uncertainties, highlighting applications and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how active visual perception improves information acquisition in complex environments compared to passive systems, and its potential impact on fields like robotics and surveillance.

Method: The paper provides a comprehensive overview, analyzing the capabilities of active visual perception, its current research, and integration with multimodal sensory inputs.

Result: Identifies the advantages of active visual perception in dynamic environments but acknowledges challenges like real-time processing and decision-making complexities.

Conclusion: Active visual perception holds significant promise but requires addressing key challenges for wider adoption across various applications.

Abstract: Active visual perception refers to the ability of a system to dynamically engage with its environment through sensing and action, allowing it to modify its behavior in response to specific goals or uncertainties. Unlike passive systems that rely solely on visual data, active visual perception systems can direct attention, move sensors, or interact with objects to acquire more informative data. This approach is particularly powerful in complex environments where static sensing methods may not provide sufficient information. Active visual perception plays a critical role in numerous applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, and surveillance systems. However, despite its significant promise, there are several challenges that need to be addressed, including real-time processing of complex visual data, decision-making in dynamic environments, and integrating multimodal sensory inputs. This paper explores both the opportunities and challenges inherent in active visual perception, providing a comprehensive overview of its potential, current research, and the obstacles that must be overcome for broader adoption.

### [70] [Structured Uncertainty Similarity Score (SUSS): Learning a Probabilistic, Interpretable, Perceptual Metric Between Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03701)
*Paula Seidler,Neill D. F. Campbell,Ivor J A Simpson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SUSS is a new perceptual similarity score that models images with structured distributions, trained generatively to align with human vision, offering transparency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perceptual similarity measures either lack interpretability (LPIPS) or miss key perceptual properties (SSIM). SUSS aims to bridge this gap.

Method: SUSS models images using structured multivariate Normal distributions trained generatively. Scores are weighted sums of component log-probabilities, with weights learned from human data.

Result: SUSS aligns well with human judgments, provides interpretable explanations, and performs competitively as a perceptual loss in imaging tasks.

Conclusion: SUSS offers a transparent, interpretable, and effective perceptual similarity score that bridges the strengths of existing methods.

Abstract: Perceptual similarity scores that align with human vision are critical for both training and evaluating computer vision models. Deep perceptual losses, such as LPIPS, achieve good alignment but rely on complex, highly non-linear discriminative features with unknown invariances, while hand-crafted measures like SSIM are interpretable but miss key perceptual properties.
  We introduce the Structured Uncertainty Similarity Score (SUSS); it models each image through a set of perceptual components, each represented by a structured multivariate Normal distribution. These are trained in a generative, self-supervised manner to assign high likelihood to human-imperceptible augmentations. The final score is a weighted sum of component log-probabilities with weights learned from human perceptual datasets. Unlike feature-based methods, SUSS learns image-specific linear transformations of residuals in pixel space, enabling transparent inspection through decorrelated residuals and sampling.
  SUSS aligns closely with human perceptual judgments, shows strong perceptual calibration across diverse distortion types, and provides localized, interpretable explanations of its similarity assessments. We further demonstrate stable optimization behavior and competitive performance when using SUSS as a perceptual loss for downstream imaging tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes PosA-VLA, a framework to improve Vision-Language-Action models by reducing redundant actions through pose-conditioned supervision, enhancing precision and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs produce inconsistent and redundant actions due to uniform perception fields, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments.

Method: PosA-VLA uses pose-conditioned supervision to anchor visual attention, aligning instruction semantics with actionable visual cues without extra modules.

Result: Extensive experiments show precise, efficient behavior in robotic tasks and robust generalization in challenging environments.

Conclusion: PosA-VLA enhances VLA models by improving action precision and efficiency, making them more suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable performance on embodied tasks and shown promising potential for real-world applications. However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.

*Melane Navaratnarajah,David A. Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlackCAtt is a black-box algorithm that uses causal pixels to create explainable, imperceptible adversarial attacks on object detectors, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in object detectors with explainable attacks and help developers understand and prevent them.

Method: BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with detector outputs to craft attacks, treating detectors as black boxes.

Result: BlackCAtt outperforms baselines: 2.7x better at removing detections, 3.86x at changing them, and 5.75x at triggering new ones.

Conclusion: Causal pixels enable precise, imperceptible attacks, demonstrating BlackCAtt's effectiveness across diverse detectors.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are a useful way to expose vulnerabilities in object detectors. Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box. We compare the performance of BlackCAtt with other black-box attack methods and show that identification of causal pixels leads to more precisely targeted and less perceptible attacks. On the COCO test dataset, our approach is 2.7 times better than the baseline in removing a detection, 3.86 times better in changing a detection, and 5.75 times better in triggering new, spurious, detections. The attacks generated by BlackCAtt are very close to the original image, and hence imperceptible, demonstrating the power of causal pixels.

*Yufeng Li,Wenchao Zhao,Bo Dang,Weimin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved ResNet34-based model for brain tumor classification, incorporating multi-scale feature extraction and channel attention, achieving 98.8% accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual classification of brain tumor images is inefficient and inaccurate, even with shallow CNNs. Improved automation and accuracy are needed.

Method: Enhanced ResNet34 with multi-scale input, Inception v2 downsampling, and channel attention for feature prioritization.

Result: Five-fold validation shows 98.8% accuracy, outperforming ResNet34 by 1% with 20% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The improved model achieves higher accuracy and reduced complexity, making it efficient for brain tumor classification.

Abstract: Previously, image interpretation in radiology relied heavily on manual methods. However, manual classification of brain tumor medical images is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Even with shallow convolutional neural network models, the accuracy is not ideal. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor image classification, this paper proposes a brain tumor classification model based on an improved ResNet34 network. This model uses the ResNet34 residual network as the backbone network and incorporates multi-scale feature extraction. It uses a multi-scale input module as the first layer of the ResNet34 network and an Inception v2 module as the residual downsampling layer. Furthermore, a channel attention mechanism module assigns different weights to different channels of the image from a channel domain perspective, obtaining more important feature information. The results after a five-fold crossover experiment show that the average classification accuracy of the improved network model is approximately 98.8%, which is not only 1% higher than ResNet34, but also only 80% of the number of parameters of the original model. Therefore, the improved network model not only improves accuracy but also reduces clutter, achieving a classification effect with fewer parameters and higher accuracy.

*Korada Sri Vardhana,Shrikrishna Lolla,Soma Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SelfDebias is an unsupervised method to mitigate biases in diffusion models by leveraging semantic clusters during inference, ensuring fairer outputs without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address biases inherited by diffusion models from large-scale datasets, aiming to produce less stereotypical and more equitable image generations.

Method: Identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space to guide the diffusion process, minimizing KL divergence between output and uniform distributions.

Result: Effectively debiases images across demographic and abstract dimensions while preserving visual fidelity, applicable to various diffusion models.

Conclusion: SelfDebias offers a scalable, unsupervised solution for reducing biases in diffusion models without requiring labeled data or external classifiers.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved widespread success due to their ability to generate high-resolution, photorealistic images. These models are trained on large-scale datasets, like LAION-5B, often scraped from the internet. However, since this data contains numerous biases, the models inherently learn and reproduce them, resulting in stereotypical outputs. We introduce SelfDebias, a fully unsupervised test-time debiasing method applicable to any diffusion model that uses a UNet as its noise predictor. SelfDebias identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space and uses these clusters to guide the diffusion process during inference, minimizing the KL divergence between the output distribution and the uniform distribution. Unlike supervised approaches, SelfDebias does not require human-annotated datasets or external classifiers trained for each generated concept. Instead, it is designed to automatically identify semantic modes. Extensive experiments show that SelfDebias generalizes across prompts and diffusion model architectures, including both conditional and unconditional models. It not only effectively debiases images along key demographic dimensions while maintaining the visual fidelity of the generated images, but also more abstract concepts for which identifying biases is also challenging.

*Hong-Kai Zheng,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSRS enhances VAR models for image generation by refining token maps early to reduce errors, improving quality with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address structural errors in VAR models caused by parallel token sampling, ensuring better image coherence.

Method: Proposes Latent Scale Rejection Sampling (LSRS) to refine token maps progressively using a scoring model during inference.

Result: LSRS improves VAR's generation quality (lower FID scores) with only slight increases in inference time (1%-15%).

Conclusion: LSRS efficiently enhances VAR-based image generation by prioritizing early scale refinement.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling approach for image generation proposes autoregressive processing across hierarchical scales, decoding multiple tokens per scale in parallel. This method achieves high-quality generation while accelerating synthesis. However, parallel token sampling within a scale may lead to structural errors, resulting in suboptimal generated images. To mitigate this, we propose Latent Scale Rejection Sampling (LSRS), a method that progressively refines token maps in the latent scale during inference to enhance VAR models. Our method uses a lightweight scoring model to evaluate multiple candidate token maps sampled at each scale, selecting the high-quality map to guide subsequent scale generation. By prioritizing early scales critical for structural coherence, LSRS effectively mitigates autoregressive error accumulation while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that LSRS significantly improves VAR's generation quality with minimal additional computational overhead. For the VAR-d30 model, LSRS increases the inference time by merely 1% while reducing its FID score from 1.95 to 1.78. When the inference time is increased by 15%, the FID score can be further reduced to 1.66. LSRS offers an efficient test-time scaling solution for enhancing VAR-based generation.

Motivation: Existing cardiac image analysis frameworks are fragmented, requiring separate networks for different tasks. PULSE aims to unify these tasks within a single architecture.

Result: PULSE achieves robust generalization across datasets and modalities, learning task-invariant priors and adapting to new imaging modalities with minimal supervision.

Conclusion: PULSE advances the field toward a scalable, foundation-style cardiac analysis framework by unifying tasks and improving generalization.

Abstract: Cardiac image analysis remains fragmented across tasks: anatomical segmentation, disease classification, and grounded clinical report generation are typically handled by separate networks trained under different data regimes. No existing framework unifies these objectives within a single architecture while retaining generalization across imaging modalities and datasets. We introduce PULSE, a multi-task vision-language framework built on self-supervised representations and optimized through a composite supervision strategy that balances region overlap learning, pixel wise classification fidelity, and boundary aware IoU refinement. A multi-scale token reconstruction decoder enables anatomical segmentation, while shared global representations support disease classification and clinically grounded text output allowing the model to transition from pixels to structures and finally clinical reasoning within one architecture. Unlike prior task-specific pipelines, PULSE learns task-invariant cardiac priors, generalizes robustly across datasets, and can be adapted to new imaging modalities with minimal supervision. This moves the field closer to a scalable, foundation style cardiac analysis framework.

TL;DR: A method for automatic recognition and translation of Egyptian hieroglyphs using segmentation, mapping to Gardiner codes, and CNN-based translation, achieving a BLEU score of 42.2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in translating hieroglyphs due to their visual nature and multiple meanings per glyph. Deep learning advancements offer potential solutions.

Method: Three-stage approach: segmentation with Contour and Detectron2, mapping symbols to Gardiner codes, and translation using a CNN model.

Result: Achieved a BLEU score of 42.2, outperforming prior research.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively translates hieroglyphs, demonstrating deep learning's potential for ancient script translation.

Abstract: Egyptian hieroglyphs, the ancient Egyptian writing system, are composed entirely of drawings. Translating these glyphs into English poses various challenges, including the fact that a single glyph can have multiple meanings. Deep learning translation applications are evolving rapidly, producing remarkable results that significantly impact our lives. In this research, we propose a method for the automatic recognition and translation of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs from images to English. This study utilized two datasets for classification and translation: the Morris Franken dataset and the EgyptianTranslation dataset. Our approach is divided into three stages: segmentation (using Contour and Detectron2), mapping symbols to Gardiner codes, and translation (using the CNN model). The model achieved a BLEU score of 42.2, a significant result compared to previous research.

### [79] [A Robust Camera-based Method for Breath Rate Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03827)
*Alexey Protopopov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust method for measuring human breath rate from video footage achieves high accuracy with minimal hardware, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cheap cameras enable breath rate measurement from video, but existing methods lack accuracy or ideal condition adaptability.

Method: Combines mathematical transforms to measure breath rate, tested on videos of 14 volunteers totaling over 2.5 hours.

Result: Achieved a relative deviation under 5% and mean absolute error of 0.57 respirations per minute, surpassing prior works.

Conclusion: The proposed method is robust against movement distortions, enabling remote breath rate measurement without behavior restrictions.

Abstract: Proliferation of cheap and accessible cameras makes it possible to measure a subject's breath rate from video footage alone. Recent works on this topic have proposed a variety of approaches for accurately measuring human breath rate, however they are either tested in near-ideal conditions, or produce results that are not sufficiently accurate. The present study proposes a more robust method to measure breath rate in humans with minimal hardware requirements using a combination of mathematical transforms with a relative deviation from the ground truth of less than 5%. The method was tested on videos taken from 14 volunteers with a total duration of over 2 hours 30 minutes. The obtained results were compared to reference data and the average mean absolute error was found to be at 0.57 respirations per minute, which is noticeably better than the results from previous works. The breath rate measurement method proposed in the present article is more resistant to distortions caused by subject movement and thus allows one to remotely measure the subject's breath rate without any significant limitations on the subject's behavior.

*Ture Hassler,Ida Åkerholm,Marcus Nordström,Gabriele Balletti,Orcun Goksel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LUnet, a lean Unet architecture with fixed channels across layers, reducing parameters significantly while maintaining performance comparable to traditional and pruned Unets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Unet architectures demand high memory, limiting batch sizes and inference speed. Pruning methods are lengthy and lack generalization. The study hypothesizes that the final structure, not pruning strategy, is key.

Method: The authors design LUnet with a flat hierarchy, avoiding channel doubling as resolution halves. They compare it with pruned Unets (e.g., STAMP) and evaluate on MRI and CT datasets.

Result: LUnet achieves similar or better performance than pruned Unets with 30x fewer parameters. Skip connections enable reduced bottleneck channels without performance loss.

Conclusion: LUnet offers a compact, efficient alternative to traditional and pruned Unets, with fewer parameters and comparable performance, making it suitable for semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Unet and its variations have been standard in semantic image segmentation, especially for computer assisted radiology. Current Unet architectures iteratively downsample spatial resolution while increasing channel dimensions to preserve information content. Such a structure demands a large memory footprint, limiting training batch sizes and increasing inference latency. Channel pruning compresses Unet architecture without accuracy loss, but requires lengthy optimization and may not generalize across tasks and datasets. By investigating Unet pruning, we hypothesize that the final structure is the crucial factor, not the channel selection strategy of pruning. Based on our observations, we propose a lean Unet architecture (LUnet) with a compact, flat hierarchy where channels are not doubled as resolution is halved. We evaluate on a public MRI dataset allowing comparable reporting, as well as on two internal CT datasets. We show that a state-of-the-art pruning solution (STAMP) mainly prunes from the layers with the highest number of channels. Comparatively, simply eliminating a random channel at the pruning-identified layer or at the largest layer achieves similar or better performance. Our proposed LUnet with fixed architectures and over 30 times fewer parameters achieves performance comparable to both conventional Unet counterparts and data-adaptively pruned networks. The proposed lean Unet with constant channel count across layers requires far fewer parameters while achieving performance superior to standard Unet for the same total number of parameters. Skip connections allow Unet bottleneck channels to be largely reduced, unlike standard encoder-decoder architectures requiring increased bottleneck channels for information propagation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for HAR face challenges such as information redundancy, noise susceptibility, and high storage costs. HP-Net aims to overcome these by leveraging rich, concise features.

Method: HP-Net uses a feedback pooling module to extract robust features, a spatial-motion co-learning module, and a text refinement modulation module to integrate multimodal data.

Result: HP-Net outperforms existing methods on benchmarks like NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Toyota-Smarthome, and UAV-Human.

Conclusion: HP-Net provides a robust solution for HAR by effectively pooling features and integrating multimodal data, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) in videos has garnered widespread attention due to the rich information in RGB videos. Nevertheless, existing methods for extracting deep features from RGB videos face challenges such as information redundancy, susceptibility to noise and high storage costs. To address these issues and fully harness the useful information in videos, we propose a novel heatmap pooling network (HP-Net) for action recognition from videos, which extracts information-rich, robust and concise pooled features of the human body in videos through a feedback pooling module. The extracted pooled features demonstrate obvious performance advantages over the previously obtained pose data and heatmap features from videos. In addition, we design a spatial-motion co-learning module and a text refinement modulation module to integrate the extracted pooled features with other multimodal data, enabling more robust action recognition. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Toyota-Smarthome and UAV-Human consistently verify the effectiveness of our HP-Net, which outperforms the existing human action recognition methods.

*Letian Zhou,Songhua Liu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDA addresses limitations in Dataset Distillation (DD) by aligning general text-to-image models with target dataset semantics using core distribution discovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance without target-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DD methods either rely on expensive diffusion models trained on target datasets or suffer from distributional mismatches with generic text-to-image models. CoDA aims to overcome these issues by aligning general priors with target semantics.

Method: CoDA identifies the intrinsic core distribution of the target dataset using density-based discovery and aligns the generative process of an off-the-shelf text-to-image model with this distribution.

Result: CoDA matches or surpasses previous DD methods' performance without target-specific training, achieving a new SOTA accuracy of 60.4% at 50 IPC on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: CoDA offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for DD by leveraging generic generative models, bridging the gap between general priors and target-specific semantics.

Abstract: Prevailing Dataset Distillation (DD) methods leveraging generative models confront two fundamental limitations. First, despite pioneering the use of diffusion models in DD and delivering impressive performance, the vast majority of approaches paradoxically require a diffusion model pre-trained on the full target dataset, undermining the very purpose of DD and incurring prohibitive training costs. Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model. Our key idea is to first identify the "intrinsic core distribution" of the target dataset using a robust density-based discovery mechanism. We then steer the generative process to align the generated samples with this core distribution. By doing so, CoDA effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose generative priors and target semantics, yielding highly representative distilled datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that, without relying on a generative model specifically trained on the target dataset, CoDA achieves performance on par with or even superior to previous methods with such reliance across all benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K and its subsets. Notably, it establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.4% at the 50-images-per-class (IPC) setup on ImageNet-1K. Our code is available on the project webpage: https://github.com/zzzlt422/CoDA

*Jin-Ting He,Fu-Jen Tsai,Yan-Tsung Peng,Min-Hung Chen,Chia-Wen Lin,Yen-Yu Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlurDM integrates blur formation into diffusion models for deblurring, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models don't fully utilize blurring processes, limiting deblurring potential.

Method: BlurDM uses a dual-diffusion forward scheme and latent space integration for deblurring.

Result: BlurDM consistently improves deblurring on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: BlurDM effectively integrates blur dynamics into diffusion models for better deblurring.

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for dynamic scene deblurring; however, existing studies often fail to leverage the intrinsic nature of the blurring process within diffusion models, limiting their full potential. To address it, we present a Blur Diffusion Model (BlurDM), which seamlessly integrates the blur formation process into diffusion for image deblurring. Observing that motion blur stems from continuous exposure, BlurDM implicitly models the blur formation process through a dual-diffusion forward scheme, diffusing both noise and blur onto a sharp image. During the reverse generation process, we derive a dual denoising and deblurring formulation, enabling BlurDM to recover the sharp image by simultaneously denoising and deblurring, given pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred image as input. Additionally, to efficiently integrate BlurDM into deblurring networks, we perform BlurDM in the latent space, forming a flexible prior generation network for deblurring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlurDM significantly and consistently enhances existing deblurring methods on four benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: DIQ-H is a new benchmark evaluating Vision-Language Model robustness under dynamic visual degradation in temporal sequences, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on persistent hallucinations and temporal errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook temporal degradation and error propagation in VLMs, critical for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. DIQ-H aims to fill this gap.

Method: DIQ-H applies physics-based corruptions (e.g., motion blur, sensor noise) and measures hallucination persistence, error recovery, and temporal consistency through multi-turn QA tasks. UIR generates pseudo-ground-truth using uncertainty filtering.

Result: Experiments show robustness gaps: GPT-4o achieves a 78.5% recovery rate, while open-source models struggle (<60% temporal consistency). UIR improves accuracy by 15.3%.

Conclusion: DIQ-H offers a comprehensive platform for assessing VLM reliability in real-world scenarios, highlighting significant robustness challenges.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deployed in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving must handle continuous visual streams under imperfect conditions. However, existing benchmarks focus on static, high-quality images and ignore temporal degradation and error propagation, which are critical failure modes where transient visual corruption induces hallucinations that persist across subsequent frames. We introduce DIQ-H, the first benchmark for evaluating VLM robustness under dynamic visual degradation in temporal sequences. DIQ-H applies physics-based corruptions including motion blur, sensor noise, and compression artifacts, and measures hallucination persistence, error recovery, and temporal consistency through multi-turn question-answering tasks. To enable scalable annotation, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Iterative Refinement (UIR), which generates reliable pseudo-ground-truth using lightweight VLMs with uncertainty filtering, achieving a 15.3 percent accuracy improvement. Experiments on 16 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal substantial robustness gaps: even advanced models such as GPT-4o achieve only a 78.5 percent recovery rate, while open-source models struggle with temporal consistency at less than 60 percent. DIQ-H provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating VLM reliability in real-world deployments.

*Hang Xu,Linjiang Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores text embedding perturbation (TEP) in T2I diffusion models to enhance generative diversity and quality by leveraging complementary randomness behaviors in the frequency domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The stochastic noise in T2I diffusion models' impact on performance is unexplored. This work addresses this gap by analyzing randomness effects and proposing TEP.

Method: Introduces step-based text embedding perturbation and adapts perturbation intensity based on frequency-specific contributions and tolerance. Combines with spatial noise.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements on benchmarks with minimal additional computation.

Conclusion: TEP enhances generative diversity and quality by complementing spatial noise, showing promise for seamless integration into existing TTS methods.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) aims to achieve better results by increasing random sampling and evaluating samples based on rules and metrics. However, in text-to-image(T2I) diffusion models, most related works focus on search strategies and reward models, yet the impact of the stochastic characteristic of noise in T2I diffusion models on the method's performance remains unexplored. In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

TL;DR: A public dataset of 339 prostate biopsy slides from Iraq aims to improve AI model generalizability in pathology for underrepresented regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of diverse histopathology datasets, especially from non-Western regions like the Middle East, limits AI model generalizability. This dataset seeks to address that gap.

Method: The dataset includes 339 whole-slide images from 185 Iraqi patients, with Gleason scores and grades assigned by three pathologists. Scanned using three types of scanners, the data remains in native formats.

Result: The dataset supports grading concordance, color normalization, and cross-scanner robustness evaluations.

Conclusion: Public release of this diverse dataset enhances AI development for global populations and will be available via the Bioimage Archive under CC BY 4.0.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in digital pathology. Publicly available histopathology datasets remain scarce, and those that do exist predominantly represent Western populations. Consequently, the generalizability of AI models to populations from less digitized regions, such as the Middle East, is largely unknown. This motivates the public release of our dataset to support the development and validation of pathology AI models across globally diverse populations. We present 339 whole-slide images of prostate core needle biopsies from a consecutive series of 185 patients collected in Erbil, Iraq. The slides are associated with Gleason scores and International Society of Urological Pathology grades assigned independently by three pathologists. Scanning was performed using two high-throughput scanners (Leica and Hamamatsu) and one compact scanner (Grundium). All slides were de-identified and are provided in their native formats without further conversion. The dataset enables grading concordance analyses, color normalization, and cross-scanner robustness evaluations. Data will be deposited in the Bioimage Archive (BIA) under accession code: to be announced (TBA), and released under a CC BY 4.0 license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in long-form video understanding due to limited context lengths and computational costs motivate simpler yet effective solutions.

Method: DIG uses uniform sampling for global queries and a specialized pipeline for localized queries, adapting strategies based on query type.

Result: DIG consistently outperforms baselines and enhances LMM performance, scaling effectively to 256 input frames.

Conclusion: DIG demonstrates that complex search mechanisms aren't always necessary, offering a balanced and efficient solution for long-form video understanding.

Abstract: The application of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to long-form video understanding is constrained by limited context lengths and the computationally prohibitive cost of processing dense video tokens. Consequently, recent research has focused on query-aware frame selection, methods that often incur significant computational overhead. This paper challenges the assumption that such complex search mechanisms are universally necessary. We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries. Experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that DIG consistently outperforms existing baselines and robustly improves LMM performance, even when scaling the input frame count to 256.

Motivation: Explore the impact of pre-training, intermediate fine-tuning, and downstream tasks on a small ViT.

Method: Experiment with three distinct datasets and training objectives on a 5M-parameter ViT.

Result: Pre-training helps but has diminishing returns; intermediate fine-tuning can harm performance.

Conclusion: Targeted pre-training and careful data selection are key for small ViTs.

Abstract: While transformer-based architectures have taken computer vision and NLP by storm, they often require a vast amount of parameters and training data to attain strong performance. In this work, we experiment with three distinct pre-training, intermediate fine-tuning, and downstream datasets and training objectives to explore their marginal benefits on a small 5M-parameter vision transformer. We find that while pre-training and fine-tuning always help our model but have diminishing returns, intermediate fine-tuning can actually show harmful impact on downstream performance, potentially due to dissimilarity in task mechanics. Taken together, our results suggest that small-scale ViTs benefit most from targeted pre-training and careful data selection, while indiscriminate stacking of intermediate tasks can waste compute and even degrade performance.

TL;DR: This paper examines the relevance of temporal aspects in sketch representation learning, comparing sequence modeling approaches and their impact on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if treating sketches as sequences is justified and which internal orders are most relevant for representation quality.

Method: Investigates sequence modeling of sketches using positional encodings (absolute vs. relative coordinates) and compares autoregressive and non-autoregressive decoders.

Result: Absolute coordinates outperform relative ones, non-autoregressive decoders are better, and temporality's importance varies by order and task.

Conclusion: The temporal aspect's relevance depends on context, with absolute coordinates and non-autoregressive methods generally superior.

Abstract: Sketches are simple human hand-drawn abstractions of complex scenes and real-world objects. Although the field of sketch representation learning has advanced significantly, there is still a gap in understanding the true relevance of the temporal aspect to the quality of these representations. This work investigates whether it is indeed justifiable to treat sketches as sequences, as well as which internal orders play a more relevant role. The results indicate that, although the use of traditional positional encodings is valid for modeling sketches as sequences, absolute coordinates consistently outperform relative ones. Furthermore, non-autoregressive decoders outperform their autoregressive counterparts. Finally, the importance of temporality was shown to depend on both the order considered and the task evaluated.

Conclusion: CaravelMetrics offers a robust, automated tool for multiscale cerebrovascular analysis, aiding normative modeling and population-level studies.

Abstract: We present CaravelMetrics, a computational framework for automated cerebrovascular analysis that models vessel morphology through skeletonization-derived graph representations. The framework integrates atlas-based regional parcellation, centerline extraction, and graph construction to compute fifteen morphometric, topological, fractal, and geometric features. The features can be estimated globally from the complete vascular network or regionally within arterial territories, enabling multiscale characterization of cerebrovascular organization. Applied to 570 3D TOF-MRA scans from the IXI dataset (ages 20-86), CaravelMetrics yields reproducible vessel graphs capturing age- and sex-related variations and education-associated increases in vascular complexity, consistent with findings reported in the literature. The framework provides a scalable and fully automated approach for quantitative cerebrovascular feature extraction, supporting normative modeling and population-level studies of vascular health and aging.

TL;DR: PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations for finer mask granularity in attention mechanisms, improving efficiency and information retention without binary masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic complexity and information loss issues in sparse attention mechanisms by enabling finer mask granularity.

Method: PSA uses dynamic allocation of pooling levels to KV blocks, creating an interpolation between full retention and pruning, implemented via a hardware-friendly kernel.

Result: PSA outperforms existing sparse attention methods in video understanding and generation benchmarks, balancing efficiency and quality.

Conclusion: PSA effectively mitigates information loss while maintaining computational efficiency, offering superior trade-offs for attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are the core of foundation models, but their quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for scaling. This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs.

TL;DR: A Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA) was developed to detect local regrowth in rectal cancer patients using endoscopic images, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate early detection of local regrowth in rectal cancer patients undergoing watch-and-wait surveillance to manage care and prevent metastases.

Method: SSDCA combines longitudinal endoscopic images using pretrained Swin transformers and dual cross-attention for feature emphasis without spatial alignment.

Result: SSDCA achieved 81.76% balanced accuracy, 90.07% sensitivity, and 72.86% specificity, showing robustness against imaging artifacts.

Conclusion: SSDCA provides a reliable method for distinguishing between clinical complete response and local regrowth, enhancing patient monitoring.

Abstract: Increasing evidence supports watch-and-wait (WW) surveillance for patients with rectal cancer who show clinical complete response (cCR) at restaging following total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT). However, objectively accurate methods to early detect local regrowth (LR) from follow-up endoscopy images during WW are essential to manage care and prevent distant metastases. Hence, we developed a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA) to combine longitudinal endoscopic images at restaging and follow-up and distinguish cCR from LR. SSDCA leverages pretrained Swin transformers to extract domain agnostic features and enhance robustness to imaging variations. Dual cross attention is implemented to emphasize features from the two scans without requiring any spatial alignment of images to predict response. SSDCA as well as Swin-based baselines were trained using image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of image pairs from 62 patients. SSDCA produced the best balanced accuracy (81.76\% $\pm$ 0.04), sensitivity (90.07\% $\pm$ 0.08), and specificity (72.86\% $\pm$ 0.05). Robustness analysis showed stable performance irrespective of artifacts including blood, stool, telangiectasia, and poor image quality. UMAP clustering of extracted features showed maximal inter-cluster separation (1.45 $\pm$ 0.18) and minimal intra-cluster dispersion (1.07 $\pm$ 0.19) with SSDCA, confirming discriminative representation learning.

Result: FRESCO achieves high spatial-temporal consistency and visual coherence in video-to-video translation and text-guided video editing tasks.

Conclusion: FRESCO significantly advances zero-shot video adaptation by improving consistency and coherence, validated through comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: The remarkable success in text-to-image diffusion models has motivated extensive investigation of their potential for video applications. Zero-shot techniques aim to adapt image diffusion models for videos without requiring further model training. Recent methods largely emphasize integrating inter-frame correspondence into attention mechanisms. However, the soft constraint applied to identify the valid features to attend is insufficient, which could lead to temporal inconsistency. In this paper, we present FRESCO, which integrates intra-frame correspondence with inter-frame correspondence to formulate a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a consistent transformation of semantically similar content between frames. Our method goes beyond attention guidance to explicitly optimize features, achieving high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video, significantly enhancing the visual coherence of manipulated videos. We verify FRESCO adaptations on two zero-shot tasks of video-to-video translation and text-guided video editing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating high-quality, coherent videos, highlighting a significant advance over current zero-shot methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMo is a novel autoregressive model unifying 2D human videos and 3D motions for joint generation and understanding, overcoming structural differences and leveraging LLM-inspired techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often focus on single-modality generation or integration with unrelated modalities, leaving simultaneous optimization of 2D videos and 3D motions unexplored due to their distributional gaps.

Method: UniMo models videos and 3D motions as unified token sequences using separate embeddings and a novel 3D motion tokenizer with expert decoders for accurate reconstruction.

Result: The method successfully generates corresponding videos and motions while performing precise motion capture, demonstrating unified modeling's effectiveness.

Conclusion: UniMo showcases LLMs' potential for multimodal fusion, paving the way for integrating human-centric data into broader frameworks.

Abstract: We propose UniMo, an innovative autoregressive model for joint modeling of 2D human videos and 3D human motions within a unified framework, enabling simultaneous generation and understanding of these two modalities for the first time. Current methods predominantly focus on generating one modality given another as the condition or integrating either of them with other modalities such as text and audio. Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling. Moreover, to efficiently align with visual tokens and preserve 3D spatial information, we design a novel 3D motion tokenizer with a temporal expansion strategy, using a single VQ-VAE to produce quantized motion tokens. It features multiple expert decoders that handle body shapes, translation, global orientation, and body poses for reliable 3D motion reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method simultaneously generates corresponding videos and motions while performing accurate motion capture. This work taps into the capacity of LLMs to fuse diverse data types, paving the way for integrating human-centric information into existing models and potentially enabling multimodal, controllable joint modeling of humans, objects, and scenes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to enhance ground-truth images for better supervision in real-world image restoration, using adaptive frequency masks and super-resolution to improve perceptual details without artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for image restoration are limited by poor-quality ground-truth images in datasets due to real-world data acquisition constraints.

Method: A novel framework generates enhanced ground truth images via super-resolution and adaptive frequency masks, learned by a conditional mask generator. These masks fuse frequency components optimally, preserving semantic consistency while enriching details.

Result: The approach improves restored image quality, validated by experiments and user studies. A lightweight refinement network integrates with existing models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances supervision quality for restoration tasks, avoiding artifacts and improving perceptual details.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image restoration has achieved significant success. However, when addressing real-world degradations, model performance is limited by the quality of ground-truth images in datasets due to practical constraints in data acquisition. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that enhances existing ground truth images to provide higher-quality supervision for real-world restoration. Our framework generates perceptually enhanced ground truth images using super-resolution by incorporating adaptive frequency masks, which are learned by a conditional frequency mask generator. These masks guide the optimal fusion of frequency components from the original ground truth and its super-resolved variants, yielding enhanced ground truth images. This frequency-domain mixup preserves the semantic consistency of the original content while selectively enriching perceptual details, preventing hallucinated artifacts that could compromise fidelity. The enhanced ground truth images are used to train a lightweight output refinement network that can be seamlessly integrated with existing restoration models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the quality of restored images. We further validate the effectiveness of both supervision enhancement and output refinement through user studies. Code is available at https://github.com/dhryougit/Beyond-the-Ground-Truth.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUT3R leverages self-attention maps to dynamically suppress motion-induced artifacts in 3D reconstruction without retraining, improving temporal consistency and pose robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion-induced artifacts corrupt attention propagation in static 3D reconstruction, and the pretrained transformer already encodes implicit motion cues that are unused.

Method: MUT3R uses attention-derived motion cues to suppress dynamic content early in the transformer, employing an attention-level gating module during inference without retraining.

Result: The framework improves temporal consistency and camera pose robustness in dynamic benchmarks without additional training.

Conclusion: MUT3R offers a simple, training-free solution for motion-aware streaming reconstruction by leveraging implicit transformer cues.

Abstract: Recent stateful recurrent neural networks have achieved remarkable progress on static 3D reconstruction but remain vulnerable to motion-induced artifacts, where non-rigid regions corrupt attention propagation between the spatial memory and image feature. By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself. This early regulation stabilizes geometric reasoning in streaming scenarios and leads to improvements in temporal consistency and camera pose robustness across multiple dynamic benchmarks, offering a simple and training-free pathway toward motion-aware streaming reconstruction.

TL;DR: TempR1 is a reinforcement learning framework enhancing MLLMs' temporal understanding for diverse tasks like localization and action detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance through multi-task optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve MLLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities for long-form video analysis, addressing limitations of existing RL approaches restricted to narrow tasks.

Method: TempR1 uses a multi-task corpus and GRPO algorithm, categorizing temporal tasks into three types with tailored rewards for fine-grained temporal dependency capture.

Result: TempR1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, showing strong generalization and synergistic effects in complementary tasks.

Conclusion: TempR1 establishes a scalable and principled paradigm for advancing temporal reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Enhancing the temporal understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for advancing long-form video analysis, enabling tasks such as temporal localization, action detection, and time-sensitive question answering. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for improving temporal reasoning, existing approaches are often confined to limited task types and data, restricting their generalization across diverse temporal understanding scenarios. To address this challenge, we present TempR1, a temporal-aware multi-task reinforcement learning framework that systematically strengthens MLLMs' temporal comprehension. We curate a multi-task corpus that exposes the model to diverse temporal structures and semantics, and build upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to achieve stable and effective cross-task optimization. Specifically, we categorize temporal tasks into three correspondence types between predicted intervals and ground-truth instances, and design tailored localization rewards for each, enabling TempR1 to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and adapt to different temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempR1 attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, its joint optimization over complementary tasks yields a strong synergistic effect, enhancing both generalization and single-task performance, establishing a scalable and principled paradigm for temporal reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: UniID is a tuning-free framework integrating text embedding and adapter-based methods for high-fidelity face personalization with flexible text control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance identity fidelity and text controllability.

Method: UniID combines both paradigms with identity-focused training and normalized rescaling at inference.

Result: Outperforms six state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and text controllability.

Conclusion: UniID successfully integrates dual paradigms for superior face personalization.

Abstract: Tuning-free face personalization methods have developed along two distinct paradigms: text embedding approaches that map facial features into the text embedding space, and adapter-based methods that inject features through auxiliary cross-attention layers. While both paradigms have shown promise, existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high identity fidelity and flexible text controllability. We introduce UniID, a unified tuning-free framework that synergistically integrates both paradigms. Our key insight is that when merging these approaches, they should mutually reinforce only identity-relevant information while preserving the original diffusion prior for non-identity attributes. We realize this through a principled training-inference strategy: during training, we employ an identity-focused learning scheme that guides both branches to capture identity features exclusively; at inference, we introduce a normalized rescaling mechanism that recovers the text controllability of the base diffusion model while enabling complementary identity signals to enhance each other. This principled design enables UniID to achieve high-fidelity face personalization with flexible text controllability. Extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that UniID achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and text controllability.

TL;DR: DirectDrag is a mask- and prompt-free image editing framework that enables precise manipulation with minimal user input, using Auto Soft Mask Generation and Readout-Guided Feature Alignment to maintain high fidelity and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drag-based editing methods rely heavily on masks and textual prompts, leading to trade-offs between visual artifacts and poor spatial control when these constraints are removed. DirectDrag aims to eliminate these dependencies while preserving quality.

Method: DirectDrag introduces Auto Soft Mask Generation to infer editable regions from point displacement and Readout-Guided Feature Alignment to maintain structural consistency using intermediate diffusion activations.

Result: DirectDrag achieves superior image quality and competitive drag accuracy without needing masks or prompts, outperforming existing methods in experiments on DragBench and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: DirectDrag offers an efficient, high-fidelity solution for interactive image manipulation, demonstrating practicality without manual mask or prompt requirements.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing using generative models provides intuitive control over image structures. However, existing methods rely heavily on manually provided masks and textual prompts to preserve semantic fidelity and motion precision. Removing these constraints creates a fundamental trade-off: visual artifacts without masks and poor spatial control without prompts. To address these limitations, we propose DirectDrag, a novel mask- and prompt-free editing framework. DirectDrag enables precise and efficient manipulation with minimal user input while maintaining high image fidelity and accurate point alignment. DirectDrag introduces two key innovations. First, we design an Auto Soft Mask Generation module that intelligently infers editable regions from point displacement, automatically localizing deformation along movement paths while preserving contextual integrity through the generative model's inherent capacity. Second, we develop a Readout-Guided Feature Alignment mechanism that leverages intermediate diffusion activations to maintain structural consistency during point-based edits, substantially improving visual fidelity. Despite operating without manual mask or prompt, DirectDrag achieves superior image quality compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive drag accuracy. Extensive experiments on DragBench and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of DirectDrag for high-quality, interactive image manipulation.

TL;DR: The paper reveals that existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction models like VGGT inherently filter noisy images without explicit mechanisms, generalizing well across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address degraded performance in feed-forward 3D reconstruction due to noisy images, the study explores inherent outlier-suppressing behavior in models like VGGT.

Method: Analyzing layers of VGGT under synthetic distractors, identifying a discriminative layer for noise-filtering, and leveraging it without additional training.

Result: Experiments show consistent and generalized implicit filtering effectiveness in controlled and in-the-wild datasets.

Conclusion: Feed-forward models inherently suppress outliers, offering a simple yet effective solution for noisy image collections in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Reliable 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild image collections is often hindered by "noisy" images-irrelevant inputs with little or no view overlap with others. While traditional Structure-from-Motion pipelines handle such cases through geometric verification and outlier rejection, feed-forward 3D reconstruction models lack these explicit mechanisms, leading to degraded performance under in-the-wild conditions. In this paper, we discover that the existing feed-forward reconstruction model, e.g., VGGT, despite lacking explicit outlier-rejection mechanisms or noise-aware training, can inherently distinguish distractor images. Through an in-depth analysis under varying proportions of synthetic distractors, we identify a specific layer that naturally exhibits outlier-suppressing behavior. Further probing reveals that this layer encodes discriminative internal representations that enable an effective noise-filtering capability, which we simply leverage to perform outlier-view rejection in feed-forward 3D reconstruction without any additional fine-tuning or supervision. Extensive experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that this implicit filtering mechanism is consistent and generalizes well across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel framework learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically partitioning latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components without manual intervention, validated on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods manually partition latent variables or operate uniformly in high-dimensional data, limiting robust learning of group actions. This work aims to automate the discovery of transformation-relevant structures.

Method: Introduces an end-to-end framework using learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations. Jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings within a unified optimization framework.

Result: Validated on five 2D/3D datasets, the method automatically learns disentangled latent factors for group actions, with downstream tasks confirming representation effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework successfully automates latent-space partitioning for group actions, enhancing flexibility and robustness in disentangled representation learning.

Abstract: Modeling group actions on latent representations enables controllable transformations of high-dimensional image data. Prior works applying group-theoretic priors or modeling transformations typically operate in the high-dimensional data space, where group actions apply uniformly across the entire input, making it difficult to disentangle the subspace that varies under transformations. While latent-space methods offer greater flexibility, they still require manual partitioning of latent variables into equivariant and invariant subspaces, limiting the ability to robustly learn and operate group actions within the representation space. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework that for the first time learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically discovering transformation-relevant structures without manual intervention. Our method uses learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components. We formulate this within a unified optimization framework that jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings. The framework can be seamlessly integrated with any standard encoder-decoder architecture. We validate our approach on five 2D/3D image datasets, demonstrating its ability to automatically learn disentangled latent factors for group actions in diverse data, while downstream classification tasks confirm the effectiveness of the learned representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve lightweight implicit neural representations (INRs) for video compression by addressing performance and computational speed limitations of existing INR-based codecs.

Method: Incorporates multi-scale feature grids for better performance at low complexity and replaces autoregressive models with an octree-based context model for faster entropy coding.

Result: NVRC-Lite outperforms C3 with significant BD-rate savings (21.03% PSNR, 23.06% MS-SSIM) and achieves 8.4x encoding and 2.5x decoding speedup.

Conclusion: NVRC-Lite offers a practical, efficient solution for lightweight neural video compression, combining improved performance with faster processing.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the viability of utilizing over-fitted implicit neural representations (INRs) as alternatives to autoencoder-based models for neural video compression. Among these INR-based video codecs, Neural Video Representation Compression (NVRC) was the first to adopt a fully end-to-end compression framework that compresses INRs, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, some recently proposed lightweight INRs have shown comparable performance to their baseline codecs with computational complexity lower than 10kMACs/pixel. In this work, we extend NVRC toward lightweight representations, and propose NVRC-Lite, which incorporates two key changes. Firstly, we integrated multi-scale feature grids into our lightweight neural representation, and the use of higher resolution grids significantly improves the performance of INRs at low complexity. Secondly, we address the issue that existing INRs typically leverage autoregressive models for entropy coding: these are effective but impractical due to their slow coding speed. In this work, we propose an octree-based context model for entropy coding high-dimensional feature grids, which accelerates the entropy coding module of the model. Our experimental results demonstrate that NVRC-Lite outperforms C3, one of the best lightweight INR-based video codecs, with up to 21.03% and 23.06% BD-rate savings when measured in PSNR and MS-SSIM, respectively, while achieving 8.4x encoding and 2.5x decoding speedup. The implementation of NVRC-Lite will be made available.

TL;DR: C3G proposes a feed-forward framework for 3D scene reconstruction and understanding by estimating compact 3D Gaussians at essential locations, reducing redundancy and improving feature aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods generate excessive redundant Gaussians, leading to high memory overhead and poor feature aggregation, which degrade performance in novel view synthesis and scene understanding.

Method: C3G uses learnable tokens with self-attention to guide compact Gaussian generation and leverages attention patterns for efficient feature lifting.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods in novel view synthesis, 3D segmentation, and feature aggregation, showing superior memory efficiency and feature fidelity.

Conclusion: A compact representation with geometrically meaningful Gaussians is sufficient for high-quality 3D scene tasks, offering memory and performance advantages.

Abstract: Reconstructing and understanding 3D scenes from unposed sparse views in a feed-forward manner remains as a challenging task in 3D computer vision. Recent approaches use per-pixel 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction, followed by a 2D-to-3D feature lifting stage for scene understanding. However, they generate excessive redundant Gaussians, causing high memory overhead and sub-optimal multi-view feature aggregation, leading to degraded novel view synthesis and scene understanding performance. We propose C3G, a novel feed-forward framework that estimates compact 3D Gaussians only at essential spatial locations, minimizing redundancy while enabling effective feature lifting. We introduce learnable tokens that aggregate multi-view features through self-attention to guide Gaussian generation, ensuring each Gaussian integrates relevant visual features across views. We then exploit the learned attention patterns for Gaussian decoding to efficiently lift features. Extensive experiments on pose-free novel view synthesis, 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, and view-invariant feature aggregation demonstrate our approach's effectiveness. Results show that a compact yet geometrically meaningful representation is sufficient for high-quality scene reconstruction and understanding, achieving superior memory efficiency and feature fidelity compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: RELIC is a unified framework for interactive world modeling, addressing real-time long-horizon streaming, spatial memory, and user control simultaneously. It leverages autoregressive video-diffusion techniques and achieves 16 FPS generation with superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches often focus on isolated aspects of interactive world modeling, failing to combine real-time performance, long-horizon memory, and user control. RELIC aims to unify these elements.

Method: RELIC uses autoregressive video-diffusion distillation, compressing historical latent tokens with relative actions and camera poses for efficient memory. It also employs a memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm for long-duration generation.

Result: RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS, outperforming prior work in action following, long-horizon stability, and spatial-memory retrieval.

Conclusion: RELIC sets a strong foundation for next-gen interactive world modeling by integrating real-time performance, memory, and control into a unified framework.

Abstract: A truly interactive world model requires three key ingredients: real-time long-horizon streaming, consistent spatial memory, and precise user control. However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs lack precise spatial reasoning for embodied tasks, needing better adaptability in tool use without rigid pipelines.

Method: DIRL combines specialist demonstrations and frontier model traces in teaching, then refines tool coordination via RL.

Result: SpaceTools achieves SOTA on benchmarks (RoboSpatial-Home, BLINK, BOP-ASK) and reliable real-world robot manipulation.

Conclusion: DIRL significantly improves VLMs' tool-augmented spatial reasoning, offering a scalable solution for embodied applications.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong qualitative visual understanding, but struggle with metrically precise spatial reasoning required for embodied applications. The agentic paradigm promises that VLMs can use a wide variety of tools that could augment these capabilities, such as depth estimators, segmentation models, and pose estimators. Yet it remains an open challenge how to realize this vision without solely relying on handcrafted prompting strategies or enforcing fixed, predefined tool pipelines that limit VLMs' ability to discover optimal tool-use patterns. Reinforcement Learning could overcome this gap, but has so far been limited to reasoning with a single visual tool due to the large search space in multi-tool reasoning. We introduce Double Interactive Reinforcement Learning (DIRL), a two-phase training framework where VLMs learn to coordinate multiple tools through interactive exploration and feedback. In the teaching phase, we combine demonstrations from a single tool specialist trained via interactive RL with traces from a frontier model using all tools. In the exploration phase, the model further refines multi-tool coordination through continued RL. Our model, SpaceTools, with tool-augmented spatial reasoning ability, achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial understanding benchmarks (RoboSpatial-Home, BLINK, BOP-ASK) and demonstrates reliable real-world manipulation using a 7-DOF robot as a tool. DIRL provides substantial improvements over the vanilla SFT (+12% on RoboSpatial) and RL (+16% on RoboSpatial) baselines. Project page: https://spacetools.github.io/.

*Qinyu Zhao,Guangting Zheng,Tao Yang,Rui Zhu,Xingjian Leng,Stephen Gould,Liang Zheng*

TL;DR: SimFlow simplifies Normalizing Flows by fixing VAE variance to a constant, improving training stability and performance without additional noise or denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of prior NF methods involving complex pipelines and suboptimal VAE encoder performance.

Method: Fix the variance predicted by the VAE encoder to a constant (e.g., 0.5), simplifying the pipeline and enabling joint training of NF and VAE.

Result: Achieves a gFID score of 2.15 on ImageNet 256x256, outperforming STARFlow (2.40), and integrates with REPA-E for a new state-of-the-art gFID of 1.91.

Conclusion: SimFlow's simplicity and effectiveness advance NF performance, setting a new benchmark in image generation tasks.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) learn invertible mappings between the data and a Gaussian distribution. Prior works usually suffer from two limitations. First, they add random noise to training samples or VAE latents as data augmentation, introducing complex pipelines including extra noising and denoising steps. Second, they use a pretrained and frozen VAE encoder, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction and generation quality. In this paper, we find that the two issues can be solved in a very simple way: just fixing the variance (which would otherwise be predicted by the VAE encoder) to a constant (e.g., 0.5). On the one hand, this method allows the encoder to output a broader distribution of tokens and the decoder to learn to reconstruct clean images from the augmented token distribution, avoiding additional noise or denoising design. On the other hand, fixed variance simplifies the VAE evidence lower bound, making it stable to train an NF with a VAE jointly. On the ImageNet $256 \times 256$ generation task, our model SimFlow obtains a gFID score of 2.15, outperforming the state-of-the-art method STARFlow (gFID 2.40). Moreover, SimFlow can be seamlessly integrated with the end-to-end representation alignment (REPA-E) method and achieves an improved gFID of 1.91, setting a new state of the art among NFs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'single-life' learning, training vision models on one person's egocentric videos, showing aligned geometric understanding, generalizable representations, and comparable performance to diverse web data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of training visual models exclusively on individual lives' egocentric videos for robust and generalizable representation learning.

Method: Self-supervised training of visual encoders on distinct datasets capturing different lives, using cross-attention-based metrics for alignment and evaluating transferability to tasks like depth estimation.

Result: Models trained on individual lives achieve aligned geometric understanding, generalizable representations for unseen tasks, and performance comparable to diverse web data.

Conclusion: Single-life learning leverages shared world structure to train consistent and powerful visual representations, proving its effectiveness.

Abstract: We introduce the "single-life" learning paradigm, where we train a distinct vision model exclusively on egocentric videos captured by one individual. We leverage the multiple viewpoints naturally captured within a single life to learn a visual encoder in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate three key findings. First, models trained independently on different lives develop a highly aligned geometric understanding. We demonstrate this by training visual encoders on distinct datasets each capturing a different life, both indoors and outdoors, as well as introducing a novel cross-attention-based metric to quantify the functional alignment of the internal representations developed by different models. Second, we show that single-life models learn generalizable geometric representations that effectively transfer to downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, in unseen environments. Third, we demonstrate that training on up to 30 hours from one week of the same person's life leads to comparable performance to training on 30 hours of diverse web data, highlighting the strength of single-life representation learning. Overall, our results establish that the shared structure of the world, both leads to consistency in models trained on individual lives, and provides a powerful signal for visual representation learning.

### [110] [Entropy-Based Measurement of Value Drift and Alignment Work in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03047)
*Samih Fadli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic framework to assess large language model safety by measuring ethical entropy and alignment work, introducing a classifier for monitoring and alerting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static benchmarks fail to capture dynamic safety issues like value drift and jailbreak attacks, necessitating a real-time monitoring approach.

Method: Defines a five-way behavioral taxonomy, trains a classifier to estimate ethical entropy S(t), and measures entropy dynamics across stress tests for base and tuned models.

Result: Base models exhibit sustained entropy growth, while tuned models reduce ethical entropy by ~80%. The framework estimates alignment work rate and enables runtime oversight.

Conclusion: The dynamic framework effectively monitors and mitigates ethical entropy, providing a practical tool for real-time alignment oversight.

Abstract: Large language model safety is usually assessed with static benchmarks, but key failures are dynamic: value drift under distribution shift, jailbreak attacks, and slow degradation of alignment in deployment. Building on a recent Second Law of Intelligence that treats ethical entropy as a state variable which tends to increase unless countered by alignment work, we make this framework operational for large language models. We define a five-way behavioral taxonomy, train a classifier to estimate ethical entropy S(t) from model transcripts, and measure entropy dynamics for base and instruction-tuned variants of four frontier models across stress tests. Base models show sustained entropy growth, while tuned variants suppress drift and reduce ethical entropy by roughly eighty percent. From these trajectories we estimate an effective alignment work rate gamma_eff and embed S(t) and gamma_eff in a monitoring pipeline that raises alerts when entropy drift exceeds a stability threshold, enabling run-time oversight of value drift.

*Anudeex Shetty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores vulnerabilities in Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS) watermarks, revealing paraphrasing attacks can bypass existing defenses, and proposes WET, a robust watermarking technique using linear transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research showed EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks, prompting the need for robust watermarking to protect intellectual property.

Method: The authors demonstrate paraphrasing attacks bypass current EaaS watermarks and introduce WET, a watermarking technique based on linear transformation of embeddings.

Result: WET proves highly robust against paraphrasing attacks, achieving near-perfect verifiability in experiments.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in existing EaaS watermarks and validates WET as an effective defense against imitation attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Based on these LLMs, businesses have started to provide Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS), offering feature extraction capabilities (in the form of text embeddings) that benefit downstream natural language processing tasks. However, prior research has demonstrated that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks, where an attacker clones the service's model in a black-box manner without access to the model's internal workings. In response, watermarks have been added to the text embeddings to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers by allowing them to check for model ownership. This thesis focuses on defending against imitation attacks by investigating EaaS watermarks. To achieve this goal, we unveil novel attacks and propose and validate new watermarking techniques.
  Firstly, we show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing the input text when attackers clone the model during imitation attacks. Our study illustrates that paraphrasing can effectively bypass current state-of-the-art EaaS watermarks across various attack setups (including different paraphrasing techniques and models) and datasets in most instances. This demonstrates a new vulnerability in recent EaaS watermarking techniques.
  Subsequently, as a countermeasure, we propose a novel watermarking technique, WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation), which employs linear transformation of the embeddings. Watermark verification is conducted by applying a reverse transformation and comparing the similarity between recovered and original embeddings. We demonstrate its robustness against paraphrasing attacks with near-perfect verifiability. We conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the significance of each component and hyperparameter in WET.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reasoning Dependency Generation (RDG), a novel framework to mitigate choice-supportive bias in LLMs by generating unbiased reasoning data, showing significant improvements in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unexplored cognitive biases like choice-supportive bias in LLMs to enhance objectivity in AI-assisted decision making.

Method: RDG framework generates balanced reasoning QA pairs by modeling/unmodeling dependencies between choices, evidences, and justifications.

Result: LLMs fine-tuned with RDG data show 81.5% and 94.3% improvements in memory-based and evaluation-based experiments, respectively, without compromising standard benchmark performance.

Conclusion: RDG pioneers a solution for cognitive biases in LLMs, advancing reliable AI decision support systems.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that some Large Language Models exhibit choice-supportive bias (CSB) when performing evaluations, systematically favoring their chosen options and potentially compromising the objectivity of AI-assisted decision making. While existing debiasing approaches primarily target demographic and social biases, methods for addressing cognitive biases in LLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first solution to address CSB through Reasoning Dependency Generation (RDG), a novel framework for generating unbiased reasoning data to mitigate choice-supportive bias through fine-tuning. RDG automatically constructs balanced reasoning QA pairs, explicitly (un)modeling the dependencies between choices, evidences, and justifications. Our approach is able to generate a large-scale dataset of QA pairs across domains, incorporating Contextual Dependency Data and Dependency Decouple Data. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on RDG-generated data demonstrate a 81.5% improvement in memory-based experiments and 94.3% improvement in the evaluation-based experiment, while maintaining similar performance on standard BBQ benchmarks. This work pioneers an approach for addressing cognitive biases in LLMs and contributes to the development of more reliable AI-assisted decision support systems.

TL;DR: InvertiTune is a framework combining controlled data generation and supervised fine-tuning to improve single-shot KG construction from text, outperforming larger LLMs and existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of costly iterative LLM prompting in Text2KG methods, which often miss complex relations in text.

Method: InvertiTune uses a data-generation pipeline to extract subgraphs from knowledge bases, filter noise, and generate natural text descriptions, enabling effective SFT for KG construction.

Result: Outperforms larger non-fine-tuned LLMs and state-of-the-art Text2KG methods, showing strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for realistic, high-quality training data to advance efficient and high-performing Text2KG systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the ability to understand and generate text, enabling significant progress in automatic knowledge graph construction from text (Text2KG). Many Text2KG methods, however, rely on iterative LLM prompting, making them computationally expensive and prone to overlooking complex relations distributed throughout the text. To address these limitations, we propose InvertiTune, a framework that combines a controlled data generation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Within this framework, the data-generation pipeline systematically extracts subgraphs from large knowledge bases, applies noise filtering, and leverages LLMs to generate corresponding natural text descriptions, a task more aligned with LLM capabilities than direct KG generation from text. This pipeline enables generating datasets composed of longer texts paired with larger KGs that better reflect real-world scenarios compared to existing benchmarks, thus supporting effective SFT of lightweight models for single-shot KG construction. Experimental results on CE12k, a dataset generated using the introduced pipeline, show that InvertiTune outperforms larger non-fine-tuned LLMs as well as state-of-the-art Text2KG approaches, while also demonstrating stronger cross-dataset generalization on CrossEval-1200, a test set created from three established benchmark datasets and CE12k. These findings highlight the importance of realistic, high-quality training data for advancing efficient and high-performing Text2KG systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for analyzing causal explanations in political text using a lightweight causal language model to extract cause-effect pairs for large-scale study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explanations are crucial in politics but lack systematic analysis in political science, with existing methods being fragmented and issue-specific.

Method: A lightweight causal language model is trained to detect and parse explanations in political text, producing structured cause-effect pairs.

Result: The method shows modest annotation needs, generalizability, and accuracy compared to human coding, enabling large-scale analysis of causal explanations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap in systematic analysis of political explanations, offering scalable and accurate tools for downstream research.

Abstract: Explanations are a fundamental element of how people make sense of the political world. Citizens routinely ask and answer questions about why events happen, who is responsible, and what could or should be done differently. Yet despite their importance, explanations remain an underdeveloped object of systematic analysis in political science, and existing approaches are fragmented and often issue-specific. I introduce a framework for detecting and parsing explanations in political text. To do this, I train a lightweight causal language model that returns a structured data set of causal claims in the form of cause-effect pairs for downstream analysis. I demonstrate how causal explanations can be studied at scale, and show the method's modest annotation requirements, generalizability, and accuracy relative to human coding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy and security risks posed by LLMs memorizing PIIs from training data.

Method: Introduces RMFT, a privacy-preserving fine-tuning technique, and MaxTER framework for evaluating privacy-utility tradeoffs.

Result: RMFT achieves significant reductions in PII extraction rates with minimal perplexity increase, outperforming deduplication methods.

Conclusion: RMFT offers a viable solution for reducing PII memorization in LLMs without compromising utility significantly.

Abstract: The current literature on memorization in Natural Language Models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), poses severe security and privacy risks, as models tend to memorize personally identifying information (PIIs) from training data. We introduce Randomized Masked Fine-Tuning (RMFT), a novel privacy-preserving fine-tuning technique that reduces PII memorization while minimizing performance impact. Using the Enron Email Dataset, we demonstrate that RMFT achieves an 80.81% reduction in Total Extraction Rate and 80.17% reduction in Seen Extraction Rate compared to baseline fine-tuning, outperforming deduplication methods while maintaining only a 5.73% increase in perplexity. We present MaxTER, a Pareto-optimal evaluation framework for assessing privacy-utility tradeoffs, and show the performance of RMFT vs Deduplication by Area Under The Response Curve (AURC) metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate sociolinguistic annotation and analysis of bilingual discourse, overcoming manual annotation limitations and enabling cross-linguistic research.

Method: LLM-assisted pipeline for labeling topics, genres, and discourse functions in 3,691 code-switched sentences, integrating demographic metadata and enriching datasets.

Result: Found links between gender, language dominance, and discourse functions in Miami data, and diglossic division in Paraguayan texts, replicating prior qualitative findings quantitatively.

Conclusion: LLMs reliably recover sociolinguistic patterns, advancing computational methods for bilingual research, especially in low-resource contexts.

Abstract: This study presents an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline for the sociolinguistic and topical analysis of bilingual discourse in two typologically distinct contexts: Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaraní. Using large language models, we automatically labeled topic, genre, and discourse-pragmatic functions across a total of 3,691 code-switched sentences, integrated demographic metadata from the Miami Bilingual Corpus, and enriched the Spanish-Guaraní dataset with new topic annotations. The resulting distributions reveal systematic links between gender, language dominance, and discourse function in the Miami data, and a clear diglossic division between formal Guaraní and informal Spanish in Paraguayan texts. These findings replicate and extend earlier interactional and sociolinguistic observations with corpus-scale quantitative evidence. The study demonstrates that large language models can reliably recover interpretable sociolinguistic patterns traditionally accessible only through manual annotation, advancing computational methods for cross-linguistic and low-resource bilingual research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical text simplification resources often overlook diverse audience needs, prompting the creation of PERCS to enable targeted, persona-specific summarization.

Method: PERCS pairs biomedical abstracts with summaries for four personas (Laypersons to Experts), reviewed by physicians for accuracy and alignment using a detailed error taxonomy.

Result: Technical validation confirms differences in readability, vocabulary, and content depth across personas. Four LLMs were benchmarked, establishing baseline metrics.

Conclusion: PERCS supports research on persona-specific communication and controllable biomedical summarization, with public dataset and evaluation materials available.

Abstract: Automatic medical text simplification plays a key role in improving health literacy by making complex biomedical research accessible to diverse readers. However, most existing resources assume a single generic audience, overlooking the wide variation in medical literacy and information needs across user groups. To address this limitation, we introduce PERCS (Persona-guided Controllable Summarization), a dataset of biomedical abstracts paired with summaries tailored to four personas: Laypersons, Premedical Students, Non-medical Researchers, and Medical Experts. These personas represent different levels of medical literacy and information needs, emphasizing the need for targeted, audience-specific summarization. Each summary in PERCS was reviewed by physicians for factual accuracy and persona alignment using a detailed error taxonomy. Technical validation shows clear differences in readability, vocabulary, and content depth across personas. Along with describing the dataset, we benchmark four large language models on PERCS using automatic evaluation metrics that assess comprehensiveness, readability, and faithfulness, establishing baseline results for future research. The dataset, annotation guidelines, and evaluation materials are publicly available to support research on persona-specific communication and controllable biomedical summarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Idea-Gated Transformer to address Topic Drift in autoregressive LLMs by separating semantic planning from syntactic generation, using an auxiliary Idea Head to predict future context. It demonstrates improved Domain Retention without compromising perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive LLMs suffer from Topic Drift due to reliance on local associations. Scaling models helps, but the NTP objective's myopia persists. The authors aim to enhance controllability and semantic retention.

Method: Proposes the Idea-Gated Transformer with an auxiliary Idea Head predicting future bag-of-words distributions. Uses a differentiable gating mechanism to prune semantically irrelevant tokens during generation.

Result: Achieves comparable perplexity to GPT-2 but significantly better Domain Retention. The gating mechanism locks generation into semantic clusters and resists drift.

Conclusion: The Idea-Gated Transformer offers a parameter-efficient solution for more controllable language modeling by addressing Topic Drift through semantic gating.

Abstract: Autoregressive Language Models (LLMs) trained on Next-Token Prediction (NTP) often suffer from ``Topic Drift'' where the generation wanders away from the initial prompt due to a reliance on local associations rather than global planning \citep{holtzman2019curious}. While scaling model size mitigates this \citep{brown2020language}, the fundamental myopia of the NTP objective remains. In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary ``Idea Head'' trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation. We propose a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively pruning the search space in real-time. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that while the Idea-Gated model achieves comparable validation perplexity to a standard GPT-2 baseline, it exhibits significantly superior Domain Retention. Qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals that the gating mechanism successfully locks generation into specific semantic clusters (e.g., Finance, Science) and resists associative drift, offering a parameter-efficient path toward more controllable language modeling.

*Qingchuan Li,Mingyue Cheng,Zirui Liu,Daoyu Wang,Yuting Zeng,Tongxuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR), improves logical reasoning by combining confidence-aware symbolic translation with backward reasoning, outperforming baselines in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current logical reasoning methods in LLMs suffer from inefficiency and unreliability due to redundant paths and semantic drift, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: HBLR integrates confidence-aware symbolic translation (converting high-confidence spans to logic) with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning (verifying premises recursively). Reflection modules ensure semantic fidelity and correct flawed steps.

Result: HBLR outperforms baselines on five reasoning benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: HBLR effectively addresses limitations of forward reasoning paradigms, enhancing logical coherence and reliability.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core challenge in natural language understanding and a fundamental capability of artificial intelligence, underpinning scientific discovery, mathematical theorem proving, and complex decision-making. Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), most current approaches still rely on forward reasoning paradigms, generating step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. However, such methods often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift, resulting in inefficient and unreliable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR). The core idea is to integrate confidence-aware symbolic translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning. In the translation phase, only high-confidence spans are converted into logical form, such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain content remains in natural language. A translation reflection module further ensures semantic fidelity by evaluating symbolic outputs and reverting lossy ones back to text when necessary. In the reasoning phase, HBLR simulates human deductive thinking by assuming the conclusion is true and recursively verifying its premises. A reasoning reflection module further identifies and corrects flawed inference steps, enhancing logical coherence. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HBLR consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard first-order attention mechanisms struggle with low-rank bottlenecks and capturing complex multi-hop relationships, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Hon dynamically refines Query and Key vectors using nested self-attention loops before final computation, with parameter-efficient weight-sharing across recursive steps.

Result: Theoretically breaks the linear bottleneck of standard attention; empirically outperforms standard Transformers on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Hon offers a scalable, parameter-efficient solution to enhance Transformer representational power.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved significant success across various domains, relying on self-attention to capture dependencies. However, the standard first-order attention mechanism is often limited by a low-rank bottleneck, struggling to capture intricate, multi-hop relationships within a single layer. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{Higher-Order Attention Network (Hon)}, a novel architecture designed to enhance representational power through a recursive framework. Unlike standard approaches that use static linear projections for Queries and Keys, Hon dynamically refines these representations via nested self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, the Query and Key vectors are themselves outputs of inner attention loops, allowing tokens to aggregate global context and model high-order correlations \textit{prior} to the final attention computation. We enforce a parameter-efficient weight-sharing strategy across recursive steps, ensuring that this enhanced expressivity incurs $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional parameters. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our method breaks the linear bottleneck of standard attention. Empirically, Hon outperforms standard Transformers on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Cooperative video games, where multiple participants must coordinate by communicating and reasoning under uncertainty in complex environments, yield a rich source of language data. We collect the Portal Dialogue Corpus: a corpus of 11.5 hours of spoken human dialogue in the co-op mode of the popular Portal 2 virtual puzzle game, comprising 24.5K total utterances. We analyze player language and behavior, identifying a number of linguistic phenomena that rarely appear in most existing chitchat or task-oriented dialogue corpora, including complex spatial reference, clarification and repair, and ad-hoc convention formation. To support future analyses of language use in complex, situated, collaborative problem-solving scenarios, we publicly release the corpus, which comprises player videos, audio, transcripts, game state data, and both manual and automatic annotations of language data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual LoRA, an improved version of LoRA, which enhances performance by incorporating inductive bias into parameter updates through magnitude and direction groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's low-rank assumption often leads to unsatisfactory performance in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Dual LoRA aims to better simulate full fine-tuning by separating parameter updates into magnitude and direction groups.

Method: Dual LoRA separates low-rank matrices into magnitude (controlled by ReLU) and direction (controlled by sign function) groups to refine parameter updates.

Result: Experiments on NLP tasks (NLG, NLU, commonsense reasoning) with models like GPT-2, RoBERTa, and LLaMA show Dual LoRA outperforms LoRA and its variants with the same parameters.

Conclusion: Dual LoRA effectively improves LoRA's performance by mimicking full fine-tuning processes, achieving consistent gains across tasks and models.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most popular methods among parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to adapt pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. However, the model trained based on LoRA often has an unsatisfactory performance due to its low-rank assumption. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Dual LoRA to improve the performance by incorporating an inductive bias into the original LoRA. Specifically, we separate low-rank matrices into two groups: the magnitude group to control whether or not and how far we should update a parameter and the direction group to decide whether this parameter should move forward or backward, to better simulate the parameter updating process of the full fine-tuning based on gradient-based optimization algorithms. We show that this can be simply achieved by adding a ReLU function to the magnitude group and a sign function to the direction group. We conduct several experiments over a wide range of NLP tasks, including natural language generation (NLG), understanding (NLU), and commonsense reasoning datasets on GPT-2, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and LLaMA-1/2/3 as baseline models. The results show that we consistently outperform LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants with the same number of trainable parameters.

### [124] [PretrainZero: Reinforcement Active Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03442)
*Xingrun Xing,Zhiyuan Fan,Jie Lou,Guoqi Li,Jiajun Zhang,Debing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PretrainZero is an RL-based active learning framework that extends reinforcement learning from domain-specific to general pretraining, enhancing reasoning abilities without verifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the reliance on verifiable rewards in specific domains and extend RL's capabilities to general reasoning, mimicking human active learning.

Method: Uses active pretraining, self-supervised learning, and verification scaling to train models on general corpora like Wikipedia without verifiable labels.

Result: PretrainZero improves Qwen3-4B-Base by 8.43, 5.96, and 10.60 on benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA, math average) and serves as a foundation for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: PretrainZero successfully enhances general reasoning in RL models, breaking the verification data barrier and enabling broader applications.

Abstract: Mimicking human behavior to actively learning from general experience and achieve artificial general intelligence has always been a human dream. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) based large-thinking models demonstrate impressive expert-level abilities, i.e., software and math, but still rely heavily on verifiable rewards in specific domains, placing a significant bottleneck to extend the performance boundary of general reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose PretrainZero, a reinforcement active learning framework built on the pretraining corpus to extend RL from domain-specific post-training to general pretraining. PretrainZero features the following characteristics: 1) Active pretraining: inspired by the active learning ability of humans, PretrainZero learns a unified reasoning policy to actively identify reasonable and informative contents from pretraining corpus, and reason to predict these contents by RL. 2) Self-supervised learning: without any verifiable labels, pretrained reward models, or supervised fine-tuning, we directly pretrain reasoners from 3 to 30B base models on the general Wikipedia corpus using RL, significantly breaking the verification data-wall for general reasoning. 3) Verification scaling: by tackling increasingly challenging masked spans, PretrainZero substantially enhances the general reasoning abilities of pretrained base models. In reinforcement pretraining, PretrainZero improves Qwen3-4B-Base for 8.43, 5.96 and 10.60 on MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA and math average benchmarks. In post-training, the pretrained models can also serve as reasoning foundation models for downstream RLVR tasks.

TL;DR: The report investigates Top-$k$ Attention in LLMs, showing its effectiveness in decoding and training phases, validating performance on tasks, and providing a theoretical entropy-based explanation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs of LLMs in long-context modeling, particularly for agents and multimodal applications, by exploring Top-$k$ Attention mechanisms.

Method: Conducts experiments on exact Top-$k$ Decoding, native Top-$k$ Attention training, and approximate Top-$k$ algorithms, analyzing performance on benchmarks like HELMET and LongBench v2. Theoretical analysis is done using entropy.

Result: Top-$k$ Decoding matches or outperforms full attention on benchmarks. Training-inference consistency enhances performance. Approximation fidelity correlates with task performance. Entropy reduction validates low-entropy adaptation to Top-$k$ Decoding.

Conclusion: Top-$k$ Attention is effective for reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving performance, supported by empirical results and entropy theory.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in the field of long-context modeling, however, their inference computational costs have become a critical bottleneck hindering the advancement of tasks such as agents and multimodal applications. This report conducts a preliminary investigation into the effectiveness and theoretical mechanisms of the Top-$k$ Attention mechanism during both the decoding and training phases. First, we validate the effectiveness of exact Top-$k$ Decoding through extensive experimentation. Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2. Second, we further explore the native Top-$k$ Attention training strategy. Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model. Finally, this report provides a theoretical interpretation from the perspective of Entropy. Experimental observations indicate that models subjected to Top-$k$ Attention SFT exhibit a distinct phenomenon of entropy reduction in downstream tasks, which validates the hypothesis that low-entropy states are better adapted to Top-$k$ Decoding.

*Haohan Yuan,Siu Cheung Hui,Haopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how reasoning strategies affect abstractive summarization in LLMs, finding trade-offs between summary quality and factual faithfulness, and suggests faithful compression is key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify the assumed utility of LLMs' reasoning capabilities for abstractive summarization and assess the impact of different reasoning strategies.

Method: Tailored general reasoning strategies to summarization, compared 8 reasoning strategies and 3 LRMs across 8 datasets, evaluating summary quality and faithfulness.

Result: Reasoning effectiveness varies by strategy and context, with explicit strategies improving fluency but reducing factual grounding, and implicit strategies showing the opposite. Increasing reasoning budget worsened factual consistency.

Conclusion: Faithful compression, not creative reasoning, is crucial for effective summarization.

Abstract: While the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in analytical tasks such as mathematics and code generation, their utility for abstractive summarization remains widely assumed but largely unverified. To bridge this gap, we first tailor general reasoning strategies to the summarization domain. We then conduct a systematic, large scale comparative study of 8 reasoning strategies and 3 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) across 8 diverse datasets, assessing both summary quality and faithfulness. Our findings show that reasoning is not a universal solution and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the specific strategy and context. Specifically, we observe a trade-off between summary quality and factual faithfulness: explicit reasoning strategies tend to improve fluency at the expense of factual grounding, while implicit reasoning in LRMs exhibits the inverse pattern. Furthermore, increasing an LRM's internal reasoning budget does not improve, and can even hurt, factual consistency, suggesting that effective summarization demands faithful compression rather than creative over-thinking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces INDI-PROP, a dataset for analyzing propaganda in Indian news media, focusing on ideological bias, narratives, and persuasive techniques. It proposes FANTA and TPTC frameworks for classification, showing significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand propaganda narratives in biased news articles, particularly focusing on Indian media, to classify ideological bias, narratives, and persuasive techniques systematically.

Method: The authors develop INDI-PROP, a dataset of 1,266 articles annotated at three levels: ideological bias, narrative frames, and persuasive techniques. They propose FANTA (integrating information extraction and contextual framing) and TPTC (systematic decomposition of persuasive cues) frameworks for classification.

Result: The frameworks, FANTA and TPTC, outperform existing baselines in classifying bias, narratives, and persuasive techniques.

Conclusion: The study successfully introduces a fine-grained approach to propaganda analysis, providing tools and datasets for future research in ideological media bias.

Abstract: Narratives are the cognitive and emotional scaffolds of propaganda. They organize isolated persuasive techniques into coherent stories that justify actions, attribute blame, and evoke identification with ideological camps. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained narrative classification in biased news articles. We also explore article-bias classification as the precursor task to narrative classification and fine-grained persuasive technique identification. We develop INDI-PROP, the first ideologically grounded fine-grained narrative dataset with multi-level annotation for analyzing propaganda in Indian news media. Our dataset INDI-PROP comprises 1,266 articles focusing on two polarizing socio-political events in recent times: CAA and the Farmers' protest. Each article is annotated at three hierarchical levels: (i) ideological article-bias (pro-government, pro-opposition, neutral), (ii) event-specific fine-grained narrative frames anchored in ideological polarity and communicative intent, and (iii) persuasive techniques. We propose FANTA and TPTC, two GPT-4o-mini guided multi-hop prompt-based reasoning frameworks for the bias, narrative, and persuasive technique classification. FANTA leverages multi-layered communicative phenomena by integrating information extraction and contextual framing for hierarchical reasoning. On the other hand, TPTC adopts systematic decomposition of persuasive cues via a two-stage approach. Our evaluation suggests substantial improvement over underlying baselines in each case.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interpretable framework to assess factual consistency in texts generated by Large Language Models, addressing hallucinations in high-stakes domains like clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Factual inaccuracies (hallucinations) in LLM outputs are problematic, especially in critical domains, and current evaluation metrics lack interpretability and effectiveness.

Method: The framework decomposes text into atomic facts, uses a flexible schema-free methodology, and introduces weighted metrics and complexity control mechanisms.

Result: The approach is benchmarked on general and clinical datasets, showing improved factual consistency assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances factual evaluation, supports interpretability, and facilitates future research in fact-aware model training.

Abstract: Large Language Models have significantly advanced natural language processing tasks, but remain prone to generating incorrect or misleading but plausible arguments. This issue, known as hallucination, is particularly concerning in high-stakes domains like clinical applications, where factual inaccuracies can have severe consequences. Existing evaluation metrics fail to adequately assess factual consistency and lack interpretability, making diagnosing and mitigating errors difficult. We propose an interpretable framework for factual consistency assessment for in-domain and open-domain texts to address these limitations. Our approach decomposes text into atomic facts and introduces a flexible, schema-free methodology. Unlike previous methods with an absolute metric, we incorporate a weighted metric to enhance factual evaluation. Additionally, we propose a mechanism to control assessment complexity in intricate domains. We benchmark our approach on popular general and clinical datasets and release our code to support fact-aware model training in future research.

TL;DR: The study maps GenAI adoption in Italy, revealing widespread use despite low digital literacy and a notable gender divide, emphasizing the need for education and further research into barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how GenAI is adopted and used in Italy, including its risks like widening digital divides and misinformation due to low literacy.

Method: Survey data from 1,906 Italian-speaking adults was analyzed to map GenAI adoption, usage patterns, and literacy.

Result: GenAI is widely adopted for work and personal tasks, even sensitive ones, despite low literacy. A significant gender gap exists, with women adopting less.

Conclusion: Targeted education and deeper research into barriers beyond literacy are needed to ensure equitable GenAI participation.

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) language technologies, particularly generative AI (GenAI) chatbots accessible via conversational interfaces, is transforming digital interactions. While these tools hold societal promise, they also risk widening digital divides due to uneven adoption and low awareness of their limitations. This study presents the first comprehensive empirical mapping of GenAI adoption, usage patterns, and literacy in Italy, based on newly collected survey data from 1,906 Italian-speaking adults. Our findings reveal widespread adoption for both work and personal use, including sensitive tasks like emotional support and medical advice. Crucially, GenAI is supplanting other technologies to become a primary information source: this trend persists despite low user digital literacy, posing a risk as users struggle to recognize errors or misinformation. Moreover, we identify a significant gender divide -- particularly pronounced in older generations -- where women are half as likely to adopt GenAI and use it less frequently than men. While we find literacy to be a key predictor of adoption, it only partially explains this disparity, suggesting that other barriers are at play. Overall, our data provide granular insights into the multipurpose usage of GenAI, highlighting the dual need for targeted educational initiatives and further investigation into the underlying barriers to equitable participation that competence alone cannot explain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Hydro-Science and Engineering (Hydro-SE) using a benchmark called Hydro-SE Bench, revealing strengths in natural sciences but weaknesses in domain-specific knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hydro-SE is interdisciplinary, requiring expert collaboration, and LLMs' potential in this domain is underexplored. A benchmark is needed to assess their knowledge and application abilities.

Method: The authors developed Hydro-SE Bench, a 4,000-question benchmark covering nine subfields, evaluating LLMs on conceptual knowledge, engineering application, and reasoning abilities.

Result: Commercial LLMs scored 0.74-0.80 accuracy, while small-parameter LLMs scored 0.41-0.68. LLMs excel in natural sciences but struggle with domain-specific standards and structures. Scaling improves reasoning but not practical application.

Conclusion: The study identifies LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in Hydro-SE, guiding future training for developers and practical applications for researchers.

Abstract: Hydro-Science and Engineering (Hydro-SE) is a critical and irreplaceable domain that secures human water supply, generates clean hydropower energy, and mitigates flood and drought disasters. Featuring multiple engineering objectives, Hydro-SE is an inherently interdisciplinary domain that integrates scientific knowledge with engineering expertise. This integration necessitates extensive expert collaboration in decision-making, which poses difficulties for intelligence. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored. However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated. To address this issue, we propose the Hydro-SE LLM evaluation benchmark (Hydro-SE Bench), which contains 4,000 multiple-choice questions. Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs. While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for Hydro-SE tasks, providing model developers with clear training targets and Hydro-SE researchers with practical guidance for applying LLMs.

*Daria Kryvosheieva,Andrea de Varda,Evelina Fedorenko,Greta Tuckute*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) represent grammatical knowledge, focusing on syntactic agreement. It identifies shared components across models and languages, revealing that syntactic agreement is a meaningful functional category in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how LLMs represent syntactic knowledge, specifically whether different syntactic phenomena use shared or distinct components, filling a gap in current research.

Method: Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, the researchers identified units in seven open-weight LLMs most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena. They analyzed overlaps across models and extended findings to multiple languages.

Result: Different syntactic agreement types recruit overlapping units, indicating agreement is a meaningful functional category. This pattern holds across English, Russian, and Chinese, and structurally similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement.

Conclusion: The study concludes that syntactic agreement constitutes a meaningful category in LLMs' representational spaces, highlighting shared mechanisms across languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can reliably distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences, but how grammatical knowledge is represented within the models remains an open question. We investigate whether different syntactic phenomena recruit shared or distinct components in LLMs. Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we identify the LLM units most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena in seven open-weight models. These units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (e.g., subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting that agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern holds in English, Russian, and Chinese; and further, in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement. Taken together, these findings reveal that syntactic agreement-a critical marker of syntactic dependencies-constitutes a meaningful category within LLMs' representational spaces.

TL;DR: DZ-TDPO addresses state inertia in long-context dialogue systems using dynamic KL constraints and temporal attention bias, achieving high win rates and robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve conflicts between evolving user intents and static historical context in dialogue systems.

Method: Proposes DZ-TDPO, combining conflict-aware dynamic KL constraints with learnable temporal attention bias.

Result: Achieves 86.2% win rate on Phi-3.5 and 99.4% on Qwen2.5-7B, with negligible perplexity overhead.

Conclusion: Precise attention regulation alleviates state inertia without destructive weight updates, preserving model capabilities.

Abstract: Long-context dialogue systems suffer from State Inertia, where static constraints prevent models from resolving conflicts between evolving user intents and established historical context. To address this, we propose DZ-TDPO, a non-destructive alignment framework that synergizes conflict-aware dynamic KL constraints with a learnable temporal attention bias. Experiments on the Multi-Session Chat (MSC) dataset demonstrate that DZ-TDPO achieves state-of-the-art win rates (86.2% on Phi-3.5) while maintaining robust zero-shot generalization. Crucially, our scaling analysis reveals a "Capacity-Stability Trade-off": while smaller models incur an "alignment tax" (perplexity surge) to overcome historical inertia, the larger Qwen2.5-7B model achieves near-perfect alignment (99.4% win rate) with negligible perplexity overhead. This confirms that TAI can be alleviated via precise attention regulation rather than destructive weight updates, preserving general capabilities (MMLU) across model scales.

TL;DR: ESPO is a new RL framework for diffusion large language models (dLLMs) that treats sequence generation as a single action, outperforming token-level methods by 20-40 points in tasks like Countdown.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models work well with RL, but adapting these methods to dLLMs is challenging due to lack of token-level probabilities.

Method: Proposes ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), using ELBO as a likelihood proxy and incorporating stable training techniques.

Result: ESPO outperforms token-level baselines, achieving significant improvements (20-40 points) on Countdown and consistent gains on math and coding tasks.

Conclusion: ESPO establishes sequence-level optimization as an effective RL paradigm for dLLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective for autoregressive language models, but adapting these methods to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) presents fundamental challenges. The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks. Our approach establishes sequence-level optimization as a principled and empirically effective paradigm for RL in dLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/ESPO.

TL;DR: Doublespeak is an in-context attack that replaces harmful keywords with benign ones in LLMs, bypassing safety measures by altering internal representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in LLM safety alignment by manipulating internal representations through keyword substitution.

Method: Systematically replaces harmful keywords with benign ones in-context, using interpretability tools to track semantic changes layer by layer.

Result: Achieves 74% attack success rate on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, showing current alignment strategies fail at the representation level.

Conclusion: Highlights a need for alignment strategies operating at the representation level to counter such attacks.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Doublespeak}, a simple \emph{in-context representation hijacking} attack against large language models (LLMs). The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones. Doublespeak is optimization-free, broadly transferable across model families, and achieves strong success rates on closed-source and open-source systems, reaching 74\% ASR on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a single-sentence context override. Our findings highlight a new attack surface in the latent space of LLMs, revealing that current alignment strategies are insufficient and should instead operate at the representation level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend contrastive decoding (DoLa) to encoder-decoder architectures (T5/FLAN-T5) and evaluate its impact on instruction-following capabilities.

Method: Adapt DoLa for T5/FLAN-T5, analyze layer-by-layer logit evolution to quantify its effect on token probabilities.

Result: DoLa improves faithfulness in some task categories but harms others; logit analysis clarifies its impact.

Conclusion: Contrastive decoding's effectiveness varies by task, highlighting the need for context-specific adaptations.

Abstract: Contrastive decoding is a lightweight and effective inference-time method that improves the quality of text generation in Large Language Models. However, algorithms such as DoLa (Decoding by Contrastive Layers) have only been implemented in decoder-only architectures and studied for their impact on improving factuality. This work adapts DoLa for the T5 and FLAN-T5 model families and evaluates its impact on the models' instruction following capabilities, which to our knowledge is the first implementation of a contrastive decoding strategy in an encoder-decoder architecture. Our results show that DoLa improves the faithfulness of text generation for certain categories of tasks and harms others. To understand these results, we present a layer-by-layer analysis of logit evolution in a FLAN-T5 model to quantify DoLa's impact on token output probabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores optimizing LLM performance for text classification in psychology via prompt engineering, testing five strategies. Key findings highlight the importance of construct definition and task framing, recommending empirical evaluation of prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM performance in psychology text classification by addressing prompt sensitivity and construct representation gaps.

Method: Evaluated five prompting strategies (codebook-guided empirical selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought, explanatory prompting) with zero-shot and few-shot classification.

Result: Persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations didn't fully mitigate poor prompt wording. Construct definition and task framing were most influential.

Conclusion: Empirically evaluate multiple prompt variants (human-crafted and automatic) for optimal performance, validated in a holdout set.

Abstract: Due to their architecture and vast pre-training data, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text classification performance. However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical.

*Michael Staniek,Artem Sokolov,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper aims to enhance LLMs' ability to follow medical consensus guidelines for accurate and explainable predictions, demonstrating success with fine-tuned models outperforming larger LLMs and addressing future forecasting challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving prediction accuracy in medicine often overlooks the need for faithful explanations to gain practitioner trust. The paper seeks to integrate medical consensus guidelines into LLMs' reasoning.

Method: Fine-tune LLMs using verbalized medical inference rules from electronic health records, focusing on derivation and value correctness. The Sepsis-3 consensus definition is used as an example.

Result: Fine-tuned small models outperform larger LLMs and models trained on medical texts. They achieve high derivation correctness but struggle with forecasting future clinical variables.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning on consensus rules enhances LLMs' medical prediction accuracy and explainability. Future improvements require addressing forecasting challenges through multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.

TL;DR: FusedKV reduces KV cache memory by 50% while maintaining lower validation perplexity by fusing informative keys and values from different layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer decoders face high memory demands for KV cache at long sequences, and existing cross-layer sharing methods underperform compared to within-layer approaches like GQA.

Method: Investigated key-value information flow, revealing distinct distributions. Proposed FusedKV (learnable fusion of bottom/middle layer KV caches) and FusedKV-Lite (direct derivation) to preserve positional info and reduce memory.

Result: Achieved 50% reduction in cache memory with lower perplexity in LLMs (332M-4B parameters).

Conclusion: FusedKV offers a memory-efficient, high-performance alternative for Transformer decoders.

Abstract: Transformer decoders have achieved strong results across tasks, but the memory required for the KV cache becomes prohibitive at long sequence lengths. Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models should include diverse linguistic variations (dialects, history, informality) to avoid bias and improve robustness, demonstrated with Basque corpus models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unintentional exclusion of non-standard linguistic varieties in language models, which reduces robustness and reinforces biases.

Method: Constructed Basque corpora (standard, social media, historical), pre-trained BERnaT models (standard, diverse, combined), and proposed NLU task evaluation framework.

Result: Models trained on diverse data outperformed standard-only ones, enhancing all task types without losing benchmark accuracy.

Conclusion: Linguistic diversity is crucial for inclusive, generalizable language models.

Abstract: Language models depend on massive text corpora that are often filtered for quality, a process that can unintentionally exclude non-standard linguistic varieties, reduce model robustness and reinforce representational biases. In this paper, we argue that language models should aim to capture the full spectrum of language variation (dialectal, historical, informal, etc.) rather than relying solely on standardized text. Focusing on Basque, a morphologically rich and low-resource language, we construct new corpora combining standard, social media, and historical sources, and pre-train the BERnaT family of encoder-only models in three configurations: standard, diverse, and combined. We further propose an evaluation framework that separates Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks into standard and diverse subsets to assess linguistic generalization. Results show that models trained on both standard and diverse data consistently outperform those trained on standard corpora, improving performance across all task types without compromising standard benchmark accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of linguistic diversity in building inclusive, generalizable language models.

TL;DR: BRAND dataset addresses bias in multilingual models for four South Asian religions, revealing persistent bias toward Islam and better performance in English than Bengali.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in bias detection for sensitive topics like religion, with multilingual models often misrepresenting religions, necessitating a dedicated dataset.

Method: Introduced BRAND dataset (2,400 entries) covering Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam, tested with three prompt types in English and Bengali.

Result: Models performed better in English, displayed bias toward Islam, and struggled with accuracy in religious contexts across languages.

Conclusion: Persistent bias in multilingual models underscores broader HCI challenges regarding religion and spirituality.

Abstract: While recent developments in large language models have improved bias detection and classification, sensitive subjects like religion still present challenges because even minor errors can result in severe misunderstandings. In particular, multilingual models often misrepresent religions and have difficulties being accurate in religious contexts. To address this, we introduce BRAND: Bilingual Religious Accountable Norm Dataset, which focuses on the four main religions of South Asia: Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam, containing over 2,400 entries, and we used three different types of prompts in both English and Bengali. Our results indicate that models perform better in English than in Bengali and consistently display bias toward Islam, even when answering religion-neutral questions. These findings highlight persistent bias in multilingual models when similar questions are asked in different languages. We further connect our findings to the broader issues in HCI regarding religion and spirituality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-stage method (CPT followed by SFT) to adapt the Qwen2.5-3B LLM to Tibetan, showing improved perplexity and translation quality, with insights into adaptation dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting large language models to low-resource languages like Tibetan is challenging due to data scarcity and cross-lingual drift.

Method: Continual Pretraining (CPT) establishes Tibetan linguistic grounding, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task specialization.

Result: Perplexity decreased (2.98 → 1.54), and Chinese→Tibetan translation quality improved (BLEU: 0.046 → 0.261; chrF: 2.2 → 6.6). Layer-wise analysis shows adaptation focuses on embedding and output heads.

Conclusion: CPT builds Tibetan semantics while SFT enhances task alignment. The study offers a reproducible framework for LLM adaptation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and cross-lingual drift. This work presents a two-stage adaptation of Qwen2.5-3B to Tibetan, a morphologically rich and underrepresented language. We employ Continual Pretraining (CPT) to establish Tibetan linguistic grounding, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task and translation specialization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent decrease in perplexity (from 2.98 $\rightarrow$ 1.54) and substantial improvements in Chinese$\rightarrow$Tibetan translation quality (BLEU: 0.046 $\rightarrow$ 0.261; chrF: 2.2 $\rightarrow$ 6.6). Layer-wise analysis across 435 layers in Qwen3-4B reveals that adaptation primarily concentrates on embedding and output heads, with mid--late MLP projections encoding domain-specific transformations. Our findings suggest that CPT constructs a Tibetan semantic manifold while SFT sharpens task alignment with minimal representational disruption. This study provides the first quantitative exploration of Tibetan adaptation dynamics for LLMs, and offers an open, reproducible framework for extending multilingual foundation models to low-resource settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods for tokenizer adaptation: continued BPE training for vocabulary extension and leaf-based pruning to remove redundant tokens, improving efficiency and utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance tokenizer adaptation for transferring pre-trained models to new domains/languages by addressing vocabulary extension and pruning issues.

Method: Proposes continued BPE training for extension and leaf-based pruning to remove unused/redundant tokens.

Result: Experiments show improved tokenization efficiency and better vocabulary utilization across languages/model families.

Conclusion: The methods offer practical tools for controlled vocabulary modification, released as open-source.

Abstract: Tokenizer adaptation plays an important role in transferring pre-trained language models to new domains or languages. In this work, we address two complementary aspects of this process: vocabulary extension and pruning. The common approach to extension trains a new tokenizer on domain-specific text and appends the tokens that do not overlap with the existing vocabulary, which often results in many tokens that are unreachable or never used. We propose continued BPE training, which adapts a pre-trained tokenizer by continuing the BPE merge learning process on new data. Experiments across multiple languages and model families show that this approach improves tokenization efficiency and leads to better utilization of added vocabulary. We also introduce leaf-based vocabulary pruning, which removes redundant tokens while preserving model quality. Together, these methods provide practical tools for controlled vocabulary modification, which we release as an open-source package.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AugServe is an adaptive inference framework improving throughput and reducing latency for augmented LLM services by optimizing scheduling and token batching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing efficiency and user experience in augmented LLM services by addressing FCFS scheduling and static token batching limitations.

Method: Two-stage adaptive scheduling and dynamic token batching based on runtime data and hardware conditions.

Result: 4.7-33.1x higher throughput and up to 96.3% reduction in latency compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: AugServe significantly outperforms existing systems in efficiency and latency for augmented LLM inference.

Abstract: As augmented large language models (LLMs) with external tools become increasingly popular in web applications, improving augmented LLM inference serving efficiency and optimizing service-level objectives (SLOs) are critical for enhancing user experience. To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality.
  This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively.

*Zayne Sprague,Jack Lu,Manya Wadhwa,Sedrick Keh,Mengye Ren,Greg Durrett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TL;DR: SkillFactory is a method for fine-tuning models to learn cognitive skills during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before reinforcement learning (RL), using rearranged model samples, improving generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address how models can leverage cognitive skills not exhibited by base models, proposing SkillFactory to learn these skills during SFT prior to RL.

Method: SkillFactory fine-tunes models during SFT using rearranged samples ('silver' SFT traces) from the model itself, preparing it for RL without relying on distillation from stronger models.

Result: SkillFactory improves generalization to harder tasks post-RL, demonstrates cognitive skill use, and enhances robustness to out-of-domain regression compared to RLed base models.

Conclusion: Inductive biases learned during SFT help models acquire robust cognitive skills during RL.

Abstract: Reasoning models leveraging long chains of thought employ various cognitive skills, such as verification of their answers, backtracking, retrying by an alternate method, and more. Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly learn these skills during a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Our approach does not rely on distillation from a stronger model, but instead uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data in the format of those skills. These "silver" SFT traces may be imperfect, but are nevertheless effective for priming a model to acquire skills during RL. Our evaluation shows that (1) starting from SkillFactory SFT initialization helps a model to generalize to harder variants of a task post-RL, despite lower performance pre-RL; (2) cognitive skills are indeed used by the model; (3) RLed SkillFactory models are more robust to regression on out-of-domain tasks than RLed base models. Our work suggests that inductive biases learned prior to RL help models learn robust cognitive skill use.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAPS, a framework combining Chain of Thought, Self-Reflection, and Auto-Prompting to enhance multi-step reasoning in LLMs. It iteratively refines prompts for better accuracy, outperforming standard methods while balancing cost and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with complex multi-step tasks, prompting the need for improved reasoning techniques like MAPS.

Method: MAPS uses iterative refinement: initial CoT prompting, adaptive self-reflection for error analysis, and dynamic prompt adjustments to guide corrections.

Result: MAPS outperforms standard CoT on benchmarks and matches reasoning-optimized models, improving general LLM performance without excessive cost.

Conclusion: MAPS effectively enhances multi-step reasoning in LLMs through iterative refinement, balancing accuracy and computational cost.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework, a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections. These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning performance.

### [148] [Exploring Syntropic Frameworks in AI Alignment: A Philosophical Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03048)
*Austin Spizzirri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper redefines AI alignment through syntropic, process-based multi-agent mechanisms, avoiding fixed human values. It critiques content-based specifications, introduces syntropy as an alignment framework, and distinguishes genuine moral capacity from simulation, pending empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address structural instability in content-based AI value specifications due to the is-ought gap, value pluralism, and the extended frame problem, proposing a more robust alternative.

Method: The paper uses philosophical arguments to critique existing approaches, introduces syntropy (recursive uncertainty reduction) as an alignment framework, and defines genuine moral capacity using compatibilist theories and experimental paradigms.

Result: The framework offers falsifiable predictions about value emergence and moral agency in AI, though empirical validation is still pending.

Conclusion: The paper shifts AI alignment focus from fixed values to developmental mechanisms, proposing syntropy and moral capacity verification as a more stable foundation.

Abstract: I argue that AI alignment should be reconceived as architecting syntropic, reasons-responsive agents through process-based, multi-agent, developmental mechanisms rather than encoding fixed human value content. The paper makes three philosophical contributions. First, I articulate the ``specification trap'' argument demonstrating why content-based value specification appears structurally unstable due to the conjunction of the is-ought gap, value pluralism, and the extended frame problem. Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics. Third, I establish a functional distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity grounded in compatibilist theories of guidance control, coupled with an embodied experimental paradigm and verification regime providing operational criteria independent of phenomenological claims. This paper represents the philosophical component of a broader research program whose empirical validation is being developed in a separate project currently in preparation. While the framework generates specific, falsifiable predictions about value emergence and moral agency in artificial systems, empirical validation remains pending.

Motivation: Addressing challenges in AI explainability and value alignment, the authors aim to develop a foundational framework for trustworthy AGI.

Method: Deconstructs cognition into Logical Atoms and fundamental operations (Pointing, Comparison), formalized via Weight-Calculation (Weight = Benefit * Probability). Implemented using graph algorithms and a global workspace workflow.

Result: Demonstrates transparent, human-like reasoning and robust learning in novel scenarios, validating feasibility.

Conclusion: Establishes Weight-Calculatism as a practical and theoretical foundation for aligned and explainable AGI.

Abstract: Current AI paradigms, as "architects of experience," face fundamental challenges in explainability and value alignment. This paper introduces "Weight-Calculatism," a novel cognitive architecture grounded in first principles, and demonstrates its potential as a viable pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations: Pointing and Comparison. Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights. This atomic decomposition enables radical explainability, intrinsic generality for novel situations, and traceable value alignment. We detail its implementation via a graph-algorithm-based computational engine and a global workspace workflow, supported by a preliminary code implementation and scenario validation. Results indicate that the architecture achieves transparent, human-like reasoning and robust learning in unprecedented scenarios, establishing a practical and theoretical foundation for building trustworthy and aligned AGI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Symbolic-solver-integrated methods enhance LRMs' reasoning efficiency for tasks with limited implicit reasoning but broad search spaces, outperforming long-CoT approaches in certain scenarios like constraint satisfaction problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce token overhead and improve accuracy in reasoning tasks by integrating symbolic solvers with LRMs, especially when long CoTs lead to inefficiencies or errors.

Method: The method involves generating executable code from reasoning tasks using LLMs and solving them with symbolic solvers, comparing performance against traditional long-CoT approaches.

Result: Results indicate symbolic solvers help with problems requiring broad search spaces and limited implicit reasoning, while LLMs like GPT-4o excel in shallow deductive tasks.

Conclusion: Symbolic-solver-integrated approaches are effective for specific reasoning tasks, offering a trade-off between long-CoT methods and declarative problem-solving.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this paradigm might incur substantial token overhead, especially when models "overthink" by producing lengthy reasoning chains, which can even lead to incorrect answers. A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks. When a declarative exemplar is provided, even CodeLlama-13B can outperform GPT-4o in difficult Zebra puzzles.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how different preference distributions affect active inference agents' performance, finding that goal shaping enhances exploitation but reduces exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how specifying preference distributions impacts inference and learning in active inference agents.

Method: Four preference distribution definitions (hard/soft goals with/without goal shaping) are tested in a grid world navigation task.

Result: Goal shaping improves performance (exploitation) but hinders learning transition dynamics (exploration).

Conclusion: Goal shaping balances exploitation and exploration, but at the cost of reduced environmental learning.

Abstract: Active inference proposes expected free energy as an objective for planning and decision-making to adequately balance exploitative and explorative drives in learning agents. The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods lack measures for LLM agents' generalization to novel social interactions, necessitating a new approach to assess cooperative intelligence.

Method: The authors introduce Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation, to test agents' ability to identify and exploit mutual gains across diverse partners and contexts.

Result: Results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest show significant gaps in agents' robust generalization, especially in persuasion and norm enforcement.

Conclusion: Current LLM-based agents lack the generalization needed for reliable cooperation in complex social scenarios, highlighting areas for improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities for social interaction and are increasingly being deployed in situations where they might engage with both human and artificial agents. These interactions represent a critical frontier for LLM-based agents, yet existing evaluation methods fail to measure how well these capabilities generalize to novel social situations. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems. Our findings reveal significant gaps between current agent capabilities and the robust generalization required for reliable cooperation, particularly in scenarios demanding persuasion and norm enforcement.

TL;DR: Argos is a reward agent for MMRL that selects scoring functions to evaluate response accuracy, localization, and reasoning quality, improving performance and reducing reward-hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse outcome-based rewards limit MMRL performance; richer rewards from reasoning tokens can enhance learning but are challenging to compute due to sample variability and noisy teacher signals.

Method: Introduces Argos, a reward agent that selects from teacher-model and rule-based scoring functions to evaluate response accuracy, localization, and reasoning process quality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in agentic tasks, reduces reward-hacking, and shows SFT post-training alone is insufficient without online verification.

Conclusion: Argos improves MMRL by providing fine-grained rewards and theoretical justification through pareto-optimality, demonstrating its effectiveness in multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Agentic reasoning models trained with multimodal reinforcement learning (MMRL) have become increasingly capable, yet they are almost universally optimized using sparse, outcome-based rewards computed based on the final answers. Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods struggle with scalability and robustness in real-world lossy communication scenarios, limiting their practical application.

Method: Introduces a generalized communication-constrained model to characterize communication conditions, distinguishes lossy/lossless messages, uses a dual mutual information estimator, and integrates message impact into a global reward framework.

Result: The proposed framework is validated as effective across various communication-constrained benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach enhances adaptability and performance in dynamic, lossy communication environments for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Communication is one of the effective means to improve the learning of cooperative policy in multi-agent systems. However, in most real-world scenarios, lossy communication is a prevalent issue. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication, due to their limited scalability and robustness, struggles to apply to complex and dynamic real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized communication-constrained model to uniformly characterize communication conditions across different scenarios. Based on this, we utilize it as a learning prior to distinguish between lossy and lossless messages for specific scenarios. Additionally, we decouple the impact of lossy and lossless messages on distributed decision-making, drawing on a dual mutual information estimatior, and introduce a communication-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, quantifying the impact of communication messages into the global reward. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach across several communication-constrained benchmarks.

*Yuki Orimo,Iori Kurata,Hodaka Mori,Ryuhei Okuno,Ryohto Sawada,Daisuke Okanohara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PARC is a hierarchical multi-agent coding agent enabling autonomous execution of long computational tasks via self-assessment and feedback, demonstrated in materials science and data science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an AI system capable of autonomous, long-horizon computational tasks without human intervention, leveraging hierarchical planning and self-assessment.

Method: PARC uses a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with task planning, execution, and self-assessment/feedback mechanisms to detect and correct errors.

Result: PARC successfully reproduces materials science results (e.g., lithium-ion conduction) and performs data analysis on Kaggle, matching human baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating hierarchical multi-agent systems with self-assessment enables AI to independently handle large-scale scientific and analytical tasks effectively.

Abstract: We introduce PARC, a coding agent for the autonomous and robust execution of long-horizon computational tasks. PARC is built on a hierarchical multi-agent architecture incorporating task planning, execution, and a mechanism that evaluates its own actions and their outcomes from an independent context and provides feedback, namely self-assessment and self-feedback. This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation. In particular, it coordinates dozens of parallel simulation tasks, each requiring roughly 43 hours of computation, managing orchestration, monitoring, and error correction end-to-end. In Kaggle-based experiments, starting from minimal natural-language instructions, PARC conducts data analysis and implements search strategies, producing solutions competitive with human-engineered baselines. These results highlight the potential of integrating a hierarchical multi-agent system with self-assessment and self-feedback to enable AI systems capable of independent, large-scale scientific and analytical work.

*Gianni Molinari,Fabio Ciravegna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RP-ReAct, a multi-agent system decoupling planning from execution, improves reliability and efficiency in complex tasks by using a Reasoner Planner Agent and Proxy-Execution Agents with context-saving strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents struggle with complex enterprise tasks due to monolithic architectures and small context windows in local models.

Method: RP-ReAct splits tasks into strategic planning (Reasoner Planner Agent) and execution (Proxy-Execution Agents), using external storage for large outputs.

Result: RP-ReAct outperforms baselines on ToolQA, showing better performance, generalization, and robustness across model scales.

Conclusion: RP-ReAct offers a scalable, reliable solution for enterprise tasks, addressing key limitations of current autonomous agents.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, autonomous agents often struggle to solve complex tasks in enterprise domains that require coordinating multiple tools and processing diverse data sources. This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains. Furthermore we establish the enhanced robustness and stability of our approach across different model scales, paving the way for effective and deployable agentic solutions for enterprises.

TL;DR: PAN introduces a programming model called 'probabilistic angelic nondeterminism' to separate agent workflow logic from inference-time strategies, implemented via the EnCompass framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods blend core workflow logic and inference-time strategies, limiting flexibility.

Method: PAN uses Python decorators in the EnCompass framework to compile workflows into search spaces.

Result: Case studies show improved agent reliability and easier strategy switching with minimal coding.

Conclusion: PAN simplifies agent programming by decoupling workflows and strategies, enhancing adaptability.

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to agent programming, the development of LLM-based agents. Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce "probabilistic angelic nondeterminism" ("PAN"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepRule is a framework automating business rule generation for retail assortment and pricing, addressing gaps like data mismatch and operational infeasibility through hybrid knowledge fusion, game-theoretic optimization, and interpretable decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses misalignment between theoretical models and real-world economic complexities in retail, identifying gaps like unstructured data issues and dynamic feature modeling.

Method: DeepRule uses a tri-level architecture: hybrid knowledge fusion with LLMs, game-theoretic optimization for supply chain interests, and interpretable decision distillation with symbolic regression.

Result: Validated in real retail, it achieves higher profits than B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility.

Conclusion: DeepRule unifies unstructured knowledge, multi-agent optimization, and interpretable strategy synthesis for effective economic intelligence.

Abstract: This paper proposes DeepRule, an integrated framework for automated business rule generation in retail assortment and pricing optimization. Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.
  Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search. We validate the framework in real retail environments achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility. This establishes a close-loop pipeline unifying unstructured knowledge injection, multi-agent optimization, and interpretable strategy synthesis for real economic intelligence.

TL;DR: MemVerse is a memory framework enhancing AI agents' ability to remember and reason coherently across extended interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents lack reliable memory, leading to catastrophic forgetting and struggles with long-horizon reasoning and multimodal environments.

Method: MemVerse combines fast parametric recall with hierarchical retrieval-based memory, organizing raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories as hierarchical knowledge graphs, supported by continual consolidation and periodic distillation.

Result: MemVerse improves multimodal reasoning and continual learning efficiency.

Conclusion: MemVerse enables scalable and adaptive multimodal intelligence by addressing memory limitations in AI agents.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large-scale language and vision models, AI agents still suffer from a fundamental limitation: they cannot remember. Without reliable memory, agents catastrophically forget past experiences, struggle with long-horizon reasoning, and fail to operate coherently in multimodal or interactive environments. We introduce MemVerse, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play memory framework that bridges fast parametric recall with hierarchical retrieval-based memory, enabling scalable and adaptive multimodal intelligence. MemVerse maintains short-term memory for recent context while transforming raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories organized as hierarchical knowledge graphs. This design supports continual consolidation, adaptive forgetting, and bounded memory growth. To handle real-time demands, MemVerse introduces a periodic distillation mechanism that compresses essential knowledge from long-term memory into the parametric model, allowing fast, differentiable recall while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MemVerse significantly improves multimodal reasoning and continual learning efficiency, empowering agents to remember, adapt, and reason coherently across extended interactions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoCo introduces a Multi-Agent Role-Based System using LLMs (explorer, exploiter, critic, integrator) to enhance Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization. It outperforms existing methods in diverse settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based AHD research lacks diversity due to single-role focus. RoCo aims to improve heuristic quality through multi-role collaboration.

Method: RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM agents (explorer, exploiter, critic, integrator) in a structured multi-round process with feedback and refinement.

Result: RoCo outperforms ReEvo and HSEvo in five COPs under white-box and black-box settings, generating competitive heuristics.

Conclusion: RoCo's role-based collaborative paradigm sets a new standard for robust and high-performing AHD.

Abstract: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) has gained traction as a promising solution for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results demonstrate that RoCo achieves superior performance, consistently generating competitive heuristics that outperform existing methods including ReEvo and HSEvo, both in white-box and black-box scenarios. This role-based collaborative paradigm establishes a new standard for robust and high-performing AHD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the rigidity in existing Omni models' reasoning behaviors—either overthinking simple problems or failing when needed—by introducing adaptability.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Adaptive SFT for foundational reasoning via reasoning-augmented data, and (2) Adaptive GRPO to optimize reasoning based on task complexity.

Result: Significant improvement in adaptive reasoning performance across multimodal tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Omni-AutoThink advances multimodal reasoning adaptability, with benchmark data and code to be released publicly.

Abstract: Recent advances in Omni models have enabled unified multimodal perception and generation. However, most existing systems still exhibit rigid reasoning behaviors, either overthinking simple problems or failing to reason when necessary. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-AutoThink, a novel adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning depth according to task difficulty. Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves adaptive reasoning performance compared to previous baselines. All benchmark data and code will be publicly released.

Motivation: To address limitations of static RAG pipelines in handling complex, multi-turn research tasks by offering granular control over research intensity.

Method: Static-DRA uses a configurable hierarchical Tree-based workflow with Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents for multi-hop retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation.

Result: Evaluated using RACE framework, Static-DRA scored 34.72 (Depth=2, Breadth=5) and showed higher scores with increased Depth/Breadth.

Conclusion: Static-DRA provides a pragmatic, resource-aware solution with transparent control over deep research processes, validated by benchmark results.

Abstract: The advancement in Large Language Models has driven the creation of complex agentic systems, such as Deep Research Agents (DRAs), to overcome the limitations of static Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines in handling complex, multi-turn research tasks. This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow.
  The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation.
  We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score.

*Vineel Tummala,Daniela Inclezan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using logic programming enables autonomous agents to reason about policy penalties, prioritizing minimal repercussions while achieving goals, with improved plan quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scenarios where policy deviation is necessary for high-stakes goals and to simulate realistic human decision-making for policymakers.

Method: Extends AOPL with penalties, integrates ASP for reasoning, ensures well-formed policies, and refines ASP-based planning algorithms to account for penalties.

Result: Generates higher-quality plans avoiding harmful actions and improves computational efficiency in two tested domains.

Conclusion: The framework enhances autonomous decision-making and aids policy refinement, showing potential for practical applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a logic programming-based framework for policy-aware autonomous agents that can reason about potential penalties for non-compliance and act accordingly. While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties. Experiments in two domains demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality plans that avoid harmful actions while, in some cases, also improving computational efficiency. These findings underscore its potential for enhancing autonomous decision-making and informing policy refinement. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AGENTSAFE is a governance framework for LLM-based agentic systems, integrating risk identification, operational assurance, and accountability measures across design, runtime, and audit phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing governance approaches for LLM-based agents are fragmented and lack an end-to-end pipeline for risk management, necessitating a unified framework like AGENTSAFE.

Method: AGENTSAFE profiles agentic loops and toolchains, maps risks to structured taxonomies, introduces safeguards, and enforces continuous governance through semantic telemetry and dynamic authorization.

Result: The framework provides actionable controls for risk mitigation, pre-deployment assurance via scenario banks, and runtime mechanisms for accountability and trust.

Conclusion: AGENTSAFE offers a comprehensive solution for governing LLM-based agentic systems, bridging gaps in current risk management and assurance practices.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents introduces a new class of risks, driven by their capacity for autonomous planning, multi-step tool integration, and emergent interactions. It raises some risk factors for existing governance approaches as they remain fragmented: Existing frameworks are either static taxonomies driven; however, they lack an integrated end-to-end pipeline from risk identification to operational assurance, especially for an agentic platform. We propose AGENTSAFE, a practical governance framework for LLM-based agentic systems. The framework operationalises the AI Risk Repository into design, runtime, and audit controls, offering a governance framework for risk identification and assurance. The proposed framework, AGENTSAFE, profiles agentic loops (plan -> act -> observe -> reflect) and toolchains, and maps risks onto structured taxonomies extended with agent-specific vulnerabilities. It introduces safeguards that constrain risky behaviours, escalates high-impact actions to human oversight, and evaluates systems through pre-deployment scenario banks spanning security, privacy, fairness, and systemic safety. During deployment, AGENTSAFE ensures continuous governance through semantic telemetry, dynamic authorization, anomaly detection, and interruptibility mechanisms. Provenance and accountability are reinforced through cryptographic tracing and organizational controls, enabling measurable, auditable assurance across the lifecycle of agentic AI systems. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a unified governance framework that translates risk taxonomies into actionable design, runtime, and audit controls; (2) an Agent Safety Evaluation methodology that provides measurable pre-deployment assurance; and (3) a set of runtime governance and accountability mechanisms that institutionalise trust in agentic AI ecosystems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for AI-native 6G networks, enabling heterogeneous AI agents to exchange compressed latent-space representations while mitigating semantic noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent AI advancements necessitate shifting from traditional bit-centric communication to goal- and semantics-oriented architectures, particularly for 6G networks.

Method: The authors propose learning communication topology and alignment maps among agents, supported by a semantic denoising and compression module. This involves solving a nonconvex dictionary learning problem iteratively.

Result: Experiments demonstrate effective alignment of AI agents, semantic cluster extraction, and high downstream task accuracy, while providing insights into semantic heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The methodology offers interpretable insights into semantic heterogeneity and advances AI-native communication for 6G networks.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI call for a paradigm shift from bit-centric communication to goal- and semantics-oriented architectures, paving the way for AI-native 6G networks. In this context, we address a key open challenge: enabling heterogeneous AI agents to exchange compressed latent-space representations while mitigating semantic noise and preserving task-relevant meaning. We cast this challenge as learning both the communication topology and the alignment maps that govern information exchange among agents, yielding a learned network sheaf equipped with orthogonal maps. This learning process is further supported by a semantic denoising end compression module that constructs a shared global semantic space and derives sparse, structured representations of each agent's latent space. This corresponds to a nonconvex dictionary learning problem solved iteratively with closed-form updates. Experiments with mutiple AI agents pre-trained on real image data show that the semantic denoising and compression facilitates AI agents alignment and the extraction of semantic clusters, while preserving high accuracy in downstream task. The resulting communication network provides new insights about semantic heterogeneity across agents, highlighting the interpretability of our methodology.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores gossip protocols as a scalable and adaptive solution for decentralized agent coordination, addressing gaps in current structured communication methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from agents evolving beyond fixed roles, requiring flexible coordination without central control in large, adaptive systems.

Method: Revisiting gossip protocols for decentralized knowledge diffusion, addressing challenges like relevance and consistency.

Result: Gossip supports context-rich state propagation and resilient coordination but raises issues like semantic filtering and trust.

Conclusion: Gossip is vital for future agentic ecosystems, but open problems remain; the paper calls for further research.

Abstract: As agentic platforms scale, agents are moving beyond fixed roles and predefined toolchains, creating an urgent need for flexible and decentralized coordination. Current structured communication protocols such as direct agent-to-agent messaging or MCP-style tool calls offer reliability, but they struggle to support the emergent and swarm-like intelligence required in large adaptive systems. Distributed agents must learn continuously, share context fluidly, and coordinate without depending solely on central planners.
  This paper revisits gossip protocols as a complementary substrate for agentic communication. Gossip mechanisms, long valued in distributed systems for their decentralized and fault-tolerant properties, provide scalable and adaptive diffusion of knowledge and fill gaps that structured protocols alone cannot efficiently address. However, gossip also introduces challenges, including semantic relevance, temporal staleness, and limited guarantees on action consistency in rapidly changing environments.
  We examine how gossip can support context-rich state propagation, resilient coordination under uncertainty, and emergent global awareness. We also outline open problems around semantic filtering, trust, and knowledge decay. Rather than proposing a complete framework, this paper presents a research agenda for integrating gossip into multi-agent communication stacks and argues that gossip is essential for future agentic ecosystems that must remain robust, adaptive, and self-organizing as their scale and autonomy increase.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores fast dominance convergence in mixed-strength agents using an extended Luby MIS protocol, confirming rapid convergence observed in nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if fast convergence to stable dominance patterns holds in realistic settings with heterogeneous agent strength.

Method: Extends the Luby MIS protocol by allowing agents to draw strength from individual distributions.

Result: Proves fast convergence persists in mixed-strength settings but shows heterogeneity alters dynamics, reducing edge elimination per round.

Conclusion: Mixed-strength settings exhibit rapid dominance convergence but with different dynamics compared to equal-strength scenarios.

Abstract: In many natural and engineered systems, agents interact through local contests that determine which individuals become dominant within their neighborhoods. These interactions are shaped by inherent differences in strength, and they often lead to stable dominance patterns that emerge surprisingly quickly relative to the size of the population. This motivates the search for simple mathematical models that capture both heterogeneous agent strength and rapid convergence to stable local dominance.
  A widely studied abstraction of local dominance is the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem. In the Luby MIS protocol that provably converges quickly to an MIS, each agent repeatedly generates a strength value chosen uniformly and becomes locally dominant if its value is smaller than those of its neighbors. This provides a theoretical explanation for fast dominance convergence in populations of equal-strength agents and naturally raises the question of whether fast convergence also holds in the more realistic setting where agents are inherently mixed-strength.
  To investigate this question, we introduce the mixed-strength agents model, in which each agent draws its strength from its own distribution. We prove that the extension of the Luby MIS protocol where each agent repeatedly generates a strength value from its own distribution still exhibits fast dominance convergence, providing formal confirmation of the rapid convergence observed in many mixed-strength natural processes.
  We also show that heterogeneity can significantly change the dynamics of the process. In contrast to the equal-strength setting, a constant fraction of edges need not be eliminated per round. We construct a population and strength profile in which progress per round is asymptotically smaller, illustrating how inherent strength asymmetry produces qualitatively different global behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study LLM communication strategies in cooperative tasks with controlled evaluation, focusing on information asymmetry.

Method: Introduces AsymPuzl, where agents with incomplete puzzle views exchange messages to solve it. Tests various LLMs, including GPT-5 and Claude-4.0.

Result: Strong models solve puzzles efficiently, while weaker ones struggle. Feedback design affects performance; simple feedback helps, detailed feedback can harm.

Conclusion: AsymPuzl highlights LLM communication divergence and feedback's role, offering a testbed for studying cooperation mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly studied in multi-turn, multi-agent scenarios, yet most existing setups emphasize open-ended role-play rather than controlled evaluation. We introduce AsymPuzl, a minimal but expressive two-agent puzzle environment designed to isolate communication under information asymmetry. Each agent observes complementary but incomplete views of a symbolic puzzle and must exchange messages to solve it cooperatively. Using a diverse set of current-generation and open-source LLMs, we show that (i) strong models such as GPT-5 and Claude-4.0 reliably converge across puzzle sizes on the solution by sharing complete information in two turns, (ii) weaker models often ignore partner messages or over-correct their hypotheses, and (iii) feedback design is non-trivial: simple self-feedback improves success rates, while detailed joint feedback can hurt performance. These findings show that even in simple cooperative tasks, LLM communication strategies diverge and depend on the granularity of feedback signals. AsymPuzl thus provides a testbed for probing the limits of multi-turn cooperation and opens avenues for studying coordination mechanisms.

Motivation: Existing privacy methods fail to balance security and utility in educational MAS, risking PII leakage and destroying pedagogical context.

Method: SRPG employs a strict sanitization stream for zero PII leakage and a context reconstruction stream (LLM-driven) to recover mathematical logic.

Result: On MathDial, SRPG achieves 0.0000 ASR (zero leakage) and 0.8267 Exact Match, outperforming Pure LLM baseline (0.2138).

Conclusion: SRPG effectively safeguards minors' privacy without compromising mathematical instructional quality.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with large language models (LLMs) enable personalized education but risk leaking minors personally identifiable information (PII) via unstructured dialogue. Existing privacy methods struggle to balance security and utility: role-based access control fails on unstructured text, while naive masking destroys pedagogical context. We propose SRPG, a privacy guard for educational MAS, using a Dual-Stream Reconstruction Mechanism: a strict sanitization stream ensures zero PII leakage, and a context reconstruction stream (LLM driven) recovers mathematical logic. This decouples instructional content from private data, preserving teaching efficacy. Tests on MathDial show SRPG works across models; with GPT-4o, it achieves 0.0000 Attack Success Rate (ASR) (zero leakage) and 0.8267 Exact Match, far outperforming the zero trust Pure LLM baseline (0.2138). SRPG effectively protects minors privacy without sacrificing mathematical instructional quality.

TL;DR: A physics-informed ML framework is introduced to model CCT diagrams for steels, achieving high efficiency and accuracy in phase classification and temperature prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying ML to complex industrial materials like steel is challenging due to intricate relationships between composition, processing, and properties.

Method: Combines physical insights with ML to develop a CCT model, trained on 4,100 diagrams and validated against literature and experimental data.

Result: Achieves F1 scores >88% for phase classification and MAE <20°C for temperature prediction (except bainite: 27°C), generating diagrams in <5 seconds.

Conclusion: The framework supports universal digital twin platforms for heat treatment and can integrate with simulations and experiments for accelerated materials design.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating the computational design and production of materials. In materials science, ML has primarily supported large-scale discovery of novel compounds using first-principles data and digital twin applications for optimizing manufacturing processes. However, applying general-purpose ML frameworks to complex industrial materials such as steel remains a challenge. A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 °C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 °C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment. Integration with complementary simulation tools and targeted experiments will further support accelerated materials design workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using LLMs as lossless encoders and decoders to mitigate hallucinations and omissions, demonstrating its effectiveness with Logic Condition Tables and Hardware Description Language code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address drawbacks like hallucinations and omissions in LLMs by leveraging lossless encoding and decoding for invertible problems.

Method: LLMs are used as lossless encoders (source to destination) and decoders (destination to source). The method is tested with Logic Condition Tables and Hardware Description Language code for a network-on-chip router.

Result: The approach significantly improves productivity by confirming correct LLM-generated logic, detecting errors, and helping find design specification mistakes.

Conclusion: Using LLMs as lossless encoders and decoders effectively mitigates common LLM issues and enhances productivity in specific applications.

Abstract: We show for invertible problems that transform data from a source domain (for example, Logic Condition Tables (LCTs)) to a destination domain (for example, Hardware Description Language (HDL) code), an approach of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as a lossless encoder from source to destination followed by as a lossless decoder back to the source, comparable to lossless compression in information theory, can mitigate most of the LLM drawbacks of hallucinations and omissions. Specifically, using LCTs as inputs, we generate the full HDL for a two-dimensional network-on-chip router (13 units, 1500-2000 lines of code) using seven different LLMs, reconstruct the LCTs from the auto-generated HDL, and compare the original and reconstructed LCTs. This approach yields significant productivity improvements, not only confirming correctly generated LLM logic and detecting incorrectly generated LLM logic but also assisting developers in finding design specification errors.

*Ciro Benito Raggio,Lucia Migliorelli,Nils Skupien,Mathias Krohmer Zabaleta,Oliver Blanck,Francesco Cicone,Giuseppe Lucio Cascini,Paolo Zaffino,Maria Francesca Spadea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive layer-freezing strategy for Federated Learning (FL) to reduce energy use and computational load while maintaining performance in MRI-to-CT conversion tasks, achieving up to 23% savings in time, energy, and CO2eq emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address healthcare disparities caused by FL's high resource demands, which exclude institutions with limited infrastructure.

Method: An adaptive layer-freezing strategy selectively freezes encoder weights based on minimal updates, using a patience-based mechanism. Energy and emissions are tracked with CodeCarbon.

Result: Reduced training time, energy use, and CO2eq emissions by up to 23% with maintained MRI-to-CT performance (small MAE variations). Two architectures improved significantly, while three showed no significant difference.

Conclusion: The strategy promotes sustainable, equitable AI-driven healthcare, advancing privacy and justice while meeting clinical needs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) holds the potential to advance equality in health by enabling diverse institutions to collaboratively train deep learning (DL) models, even with limited data. However, the significant resource requirements of FL often exclude centres with limited computational infrastructure, further widening existing healthcare disparities. To address this issue, we propose a Green AI-oriented adaptive layer-freezing strategy designed to reduce energy consumption and computational load while maintaining model performance. We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round. A patience-based mechanism ensures that freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently minimal. The energy consumption and CO2eq emissions of the federation were tracked using the CodeCarbon library. Compared to equivalent non-frozen counterparts, our approach reduced training time, total energy consumption and CO2eq emissions by up to 23%. At the same time, the MRI-to-CT conversion performance was maintained, with only small variations in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Notably, for three out of the five evaluated architectures, no statistically significant differences were observed, while two architectures exhibited statistically significant improvements. Our work aligns with a research paradigm that promotes DL-based frameworks meeting clinical requirements while ensuring climatic, social, and economic sustainability. It lays the groundwork for novel FL evaluation frameworks, advancing privacy, equity and, more broadly, justice in AI-driven healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINS-CAD is a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework that predicts cardiovascular events using synthetic coronary digital twins, outperforming traditional methods without needing computational fluid dynamics or labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early risk prediction for coronary artery disease (CAD) is crucial due to its high mortality rate, but current methods rely on computationally intensive simulations or lack physiological insights.

Method: PINS-CAD pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins, guided by physics principles like the 1D Navier-Stokes equations, and fine-tunes on clinical data from 635 patients.

Result: The framework achieves an AUC of 0.73 in predicting cardiovascular events, surpassing clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines, while providing interpretable biomarkers.

Conclusion: PINS-CAD offers a scalable, simulation-free approach to preventive cardiology by integrating physical priors into deep learning, enhancing sample efficiency and physiological relevance.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of mortality, with coronary artery disease (CAD) as its most prevalent form, necessitating early risk prediction. While 3D coronary artery digital twins reconstructed from imaging offer detailed anatomy for personalized assessment, their analysis relies on computationally intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD), limiting scalability. Data-driven approaches are hindered by scarce labeled data and lack of physiological priors. To address this, we present PINS-CAD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework. It pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins to predict pressure and flow, guided by 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop laws, eliminating the need for CFD or labeled data. When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD predicts future cardiovascular events with an AUC of 0.73, outperforming clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines. This demonstrates that physics-informed pretraining boosts sample efficiency and yields physiologically meaningful representations. Furthermore, PINS-CAD generates spatially resolved pressure and fractional flow reserve curves, providing interpretable biomarkers. By embedding physical priors into geometric deep learning, PINS-CAD transforms routine angiography into a simulation-free, physiology-aware framework for scalable, preventive cardiology.

TL;DR: A novel framework combining AWS Strands Agents and Thompson Sampling improves decision-making for generative AI agents in life sciences, enhancing user satisfaction by 15-30% without needing labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for generative AI agents in life sciences are inflexible and rely on labeled data, which doesn't adapt to changing conditions or user preferences. The paper aims to address this with an adaptive learning approach.

Method: The framework combines AWS Strands Agents with Thompson Sampling contextual bandits to learn optimal strategies from user feedback. It optimizes generation strategy selection, tool selection, and domain routing.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows a 15-30% improvement in user satisfaction over random baselines, with learning patterns emerging after 20-30 queries.

Conclusion: The proposed method adapts continuously to user preferences, requires no ground truth labels, and effectively resolves the exploration-exploitation dilemma in AI systems.

Abstract: Generative AI agents in life sciences face a critical challenge: determining the optimal approach for diverse queries ranging from simple factoid questions to complex mechanistic reasoning. Traditional methods rely on fixed rules or expensive labeled training data, neither of which adapts to changing conditions or user preferences. We present a novel framework that combines AWS Strands Agents with Thompson Sampling contextual bandits to enable AI agents to learn optimal decision-making strategies from user feedback alone. Our system optimizes three key dimensions: generation strategy selection (direct vs. chain-of-thought), tool selection (literature search, drug databases, etc.), and domain routing (pharmacology, molecular biology, clinical specialists). Through empirical evaluation on life science queries, we demonstrate 15-30\% improvement in user satisfaction compared to random baselines, with clear learning patterns emerging after 20-30 queries. Our approach requires no ground truth labels, adapts continuously to user preferences, and provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in agentic AI systems.

### [176] [Delta Sampling: Data-Free Knowledge Transfer Across Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03056)
*Zhidong Gao,Zimeng Pan,Yuhang Yao,Chenyue Xie,Wei Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delta Sampling (DS) is a novel method enabling knowledge transfer across different base diffusion models without retraining or original data access, by leveraging prediction differences at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptation components like LoRA or ControlNet are tightly tied to specific base models, making upgrades challenging due to parameter and architecture changes.

Method: DS operates at inference time by using the delta (difference in predictions before/after adaptation) to guide denoising in a new base model.

Result: DS consistently improves desired effects (styles, concepts, structures) across Stable Diffusion versions under various sampling strategies.

Conclusion: DS is an effective, plug-and-play solution for transferring knowledge in diffusion-based image synthesis without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion (SD) drive a vibrant open-source ecosystem including fully fine-tuned checkpoints and parameter-efficient adapters such as LoRA, LyCORIS, and ControlNet. However, these adaptation components are tightly coupled to a specific base model, making them difficult to reuse when the base model is upgraded (e.g., from SD 1.x to 2.x) due to substantial changes in model parameters and architecture. In this work, we propose Delta Sampling (DS), a novel method that enables knowledge transfer across base models with different architectures, without requiring access to the original training data. DS operates entirely at inference time by leveraging the delta: the difference in model predictions before and after the adaptation of a base model. This delta is then used to guide the denoising process of a new base model. We evaluate DS across various SD versions, demonstrating that DS achieves consistent improvements in creating desired effects (e.g., visual styles, semantic concepts, and structures) under different sampling strategies. These results highlight DS as an effective, plug-and-play mechanism for knowledge transfer in diffusion-based image synthesis. Code:~ https://github.com/Zhidong-Gao/DeltaSampling

*Juan Diego Toscano,Daniel T. Chen,George Em Karniadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATHENA is an agentic framework automating the SciC/SciML research lifecycle, using a knowledge-driven HENA loop to achieve super-human performance (validation errors of 10^-14) and bridge stability gaps collaboratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between theory and computation in SciC/SciML hinders progress. ATHENA aims to automate and optimize the research lifecycle.

Method: ATHENA uses the HENA loop (Contextual Bandit problem) to select structural actions guided by expert blueprints, translating them into executable code for scientific rewards. It autonomously solves complex problems in SciC/SciML.

Result: ATHENA achieves validation errors of 10^-14 and improves results by an order of magnitude with human collaboration.

Conclusion: ATHENA shifts focus from implementation to innovation, accelerating scientific discovery by bridging theory-computation gaps.

Abstract: Bridging the gap between theoretical conceptualization and computational implementation is a major bottleneck in Scientific Computing (SciC) and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). We introduce ATHENA (Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms), an agentic framework designed as an Autonomous Lab to manage the end-to-end computational research lifecycle. Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems. The framework achieves super-human performance, reaching validation errors of $10^{-14}$. Furthermore, collaborative ``human-in-the-loop" intervention allows the system to bridge stability gaps, improving results by an order of magnitude. This paradigm shift focuses from implementation mechanics to methodological innovation, accelerating scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies token dynamics in pre-trained Transformers, analyzing their asymptotic behavior and proposing refinements to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve Transformer models by analyzing token dynamics and their dependence on model parameters and positional encoding.

Method: Analyzes the dynamical system governing token behavior, identifies convergence/divergence conditions, and proposes architectural refinements.

Result: Token behavior depends on model parameters and positional encoding; convergence scenarios harm performance, and proposed refinements mitigate this.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights and practical refinements to enhance Transformer model performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical properties of tokens in pre-trained Transformer models and explores their application to improving Transformers. To this end, we analyze the dynamical system governing the continuous-time limit of the pre-trained model and characterize the asymptotic behavior of its solutions. Specifically, we characterize when tokens move closer to or farther from one another over time, depending on the model parameters. We provide sufficient conditions, based on these parameters, to identify scenarios where tokens either converge to zero or diverge to infinity. Unlike prior works, our conditions are broader in scope and more applicable to real-world models. Furthermore, we investigate how different forms of positional encoding -- specifically absolute and rotary -- affect these dynamical regimes. Empirical evidence reveals that the convergence scenario adversely impacts model performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose simple refinements to Transformer architectures that mitigate convergence behavior in models with absolute or rotary positional encoding. These findings support theoretical foundations and design principles for improving Transformer models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge deep learning with formal modal logic for reasoning about necessity and possibility while maintaining flexibility and interpretability.

Method: Introduces specialized neurons for modal operators ($\Box$ and $\Diamond$) using Kripke semantics, allowing fixed or learned accessibility relations between possible worlds. The framework is end-to-end differentiable with a logical contradiction loss.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in grammatical guardrailing, axiomatic detection, multi-agent trust, and natural language negotiation, improving logical consistency without altering task architecture.

Conclusion: MLNNs successfully combine neural networks with modal logic, offering a versatile tool for neurosymbolic reasoning with applications in diverse domains.

Abstract: We propose Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), a neurosymbolic framework that integrates deep learning with the formal semantics of modal logic, enabling reasoning about necessity and possibility. Drawing on Kripke semantics, we introduce specialized neurons for the modal operators $\Box$ and $\Diamond$ that operate over a set of possible worlds, enabling the framework to act as a differentiable ``logical guardrail.'' The architecture is highly flexible: the accessibility relation between worlds can either be fixed by the user to enforce known rules or, as an inductive feature, be parameterized by a neural network. This allows the model to optionally learn the relational structure of a logical system from data while simultaneously performing deductive reasoning within that structure.
  This versatile construction is designed for flexibility. The entire framework is differentiable from end to end, with learning driven by minimizing a logical contradiction loss. This not only makes the system resilient to inconsistent knowledge but also enables it to learn nonlinear relationships that can help define the logic of a problem space. We illustrate MLNNs on four case studies: grammatical guardrailing, axiomatic detection of the unknown, multi-agent epistemic trust, and detecting constructive deception in natural language negotiation. These experiments demonstrate how enforcing or learning accessibility can increase logical consistency and interpretability without changing the underlying task architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) framework to optimize Electric Bus (EB) charging schedules under uncertainties, ensuring cost minimization and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of EBs with renewable energy like PV panels aims to promote sustainable public transport, but optimizing charging schedules amid uncertainties is challenging.

Method: A safe HDRL framework using Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Lagrangian (DAC-MAPPO-Lagrangian) is developed, combining centralized and decentralized learning.

Result: Experiments show the approach outperforms baselines in cost minimization and safety compliance, with fast convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed HDRL framework effectively addresses EB charging optimization under real-world uncertainties.

Abstract: The integration of Electric Buses (EBs) with renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) panels is a promising approach to promote sustainable and low-carbon public transportation. However, optimizing EB charging schedules to minimize operational costs while ensuring safe operation without battery depletion remains challenging - especially under real-world conditions, where uncertainties in PV generation, dynamic electricity prices, variable travel times, and limited charging infrastructure must be accounted for. In this paper, we propose a safe Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) framework for solving the EB Charging Scheduling Problem (EBCSP) under multi-source uncertainties. We formulate the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with options to enable temporally abstract decision-making. We develop a novel HDRL algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Lagrangian (DAC-MAPPO-Lagrangian), which integrates Lagrangian relaxation into the Double Actor-Critic (DAC) framework. At the high level, we adopt a centralized PPO-Lagrangian algorithm to learn safe charger allocation policies. At the low level, we incorporate MAPPO-Lagrangian to learn decentralized charging power decisions under the Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing baselines in both cost minimization and safety compliance, while maintaining fast convergence speed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of assuming uniform treatment effects across users, the framework leverages large-scale experimental data to estimate HTE and Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) more accurately.

Method: The framework involves experiment selection, base learner design, and incremental training, combining results from numerous experiments to uncover latent user traits and stabilize effect estimates.

Result: The system successfully identified user influenceability and sensitivity to ads, with an A/B test demonstrating a sixfold improvement in key business metrics compared to typical significance levels.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively scales HTE estimation, providing actionable insights for targeted advertising and significantly enhancing business outcomes.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) models relax the assumption that treatment effects are the same for every user. We present a large scale industrial framework for estimating HTE using experimental data from hundreds of millions of Snapchat users. By combining results across many experiments, the framework uncovers latent user characteristics that were previously unmeasurable and produces stable treatment effect estimates at scale.
  We describe the core components that enabled this system, including experiment selection, base learner design, and incremental training. We also highlight two applications: user influenceability to ads and user sensitivity to ads. An online A/B test using influenceability scores for targeting showed an improvement on key business metrics that is more than six times larger than what is typically considered significant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require significant computational resources. SVD-based compression is promising but faces challenges like rank selection and parameter redundancy.

Method: 1. FermiGrad: A gradient-descent algorithm using the Fermi function for continuous rank optimization. 2. PivGa: A lossless compression technique leveraging gauge freedom in low-rank factors.

Result: The proposed methods enhance SVD-based LLM compression by addressing rank selection and redundancy issues.

Conclusion: FermiGrad and PivGa offer practical improvements for compressing LLMs efficiently.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are very demanding in terms of their computational resources. Low-rank decompositions of LLM weights, e.g. via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), is a promising approach for LLM compression, but presents several practical hurdles, e.g. selecting appropriate layer-wise ranks and getting rid of its parameter redundancy. In this work, we present two physics-inspired improvements to SVD LLM compression: (1) \textbf{FermiGrad}, a gradient-descent algorithm that determines globally optimal layer-wise ranks by relaxing the discrete singular-value truncation into a continuous optimization using the Fermi function; (2) \textbf{PivGa}, an additional \textit{lossless} compression of the low-rank factors that exploits the intrinsic gauge freedom in their parametrization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual auditing of buildings' energy consumption is impractical due to high costs and resource requirements, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Pretopology models consumption profiles, while a multi-criterion hierarchical classification algorithm (implemented in Python) uses pretopological properties for clustering.

Result: The algorithm successfully clusters synthetic 2D points and time series (ARI=1) and tests on real consumption data from 400 sites.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively automates energy consumption profiling, offering scalable optimization for building management.

Abstract: This article attempts answering the following problematic: How to model and classify energy consumption profiles over a large distributed territory to optimize the management of buildings' consumption?
  Doing case-by-case in depth auditing of thousands of buildings would require a massive amount of time and money as well as a significant number of qualified people. Thus, an automated method must be developed to establish a relevant and effective recommendations system.
  To answer this problematic, pretopology is used to model the sites' consumption profiles and a multi-criterion hierarchical classification algorithm, using the properties of pretopological space, has been developed in a Python library.
  To evaluate the results, three data sets are used: A generated set of dots of various sizes in a 2D space, a generated set of time series and a set of consumption time series of 400 real consumption sites from a French Energy company.
  On the point data set, the algorithm is able to identify the clusters of points using their position in space and their size as parameter. On the generated time series, the algorithm is able to identify the time series clusters using Pearson's correlation with an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 1.

Conclusion: Pretopological clustering offers a viable solution for mixed-data challenges in big data, providing structured and interpretable results.

Abstract: The advent of the big data paradigm has transformed how industries manage and analyze information, ushering in an era of unprecedented data volume, velocity, and variety. Within this landscape, mixed-data clustering has become a critical challenge, requiring innovative methods that can effectively exploit heterogeneous data types, including numerical and categorical variables. Traditional clustering techniques, typically designed for homogeneous datasets, often struggle to capture the additional complexity introduced by mixed data, underscoring the need for approaches specifically tailored to this setting. Hierarchical and explainable algorithms are particularly valuable in this context, as they provide structured, interpretable clustering results that support informed decision-making. This paper introduces a clustering method grounded in pretopological spaces. In addition, benchmarking against classical numerical clustering algorithms and existing pretopological approaches yields insights into the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method within the big data paradigm.

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms baselines in fairness-accuracy trade-off, with datasets and code to be released publicly.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in relational learning tasks, including node classification and link prediction. However, their application raises significant fairness concerns, as GNNs can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases against protected groups defined by sensitive attributes such as race or gender. These biases are often inherent in the node features, structural topology, and message-passing mechanisms of the graph itself. A critical limitation of existing fairness-aware GNN methods is their reliance on the strong assumption that sensitive attributes are fully available for all nodes during training--a condition that poses a practical impediment due to privacy concerns and data collection constraints. To address this gap, we propose a novel, model-agnostic fairness regularization framework designed for the realistic scenario where sensitive attributes are only partially available. Our approach formalizes a fairness-aware objective function that integrates both equal opportunity and statistical parity as differentiable regularization terms. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation across five real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates bias across key fairness metrics while maintaining competitive node classification performance. Results show that our framework consistently outperforms baseline models in achieving a favorable fairness-accuracy trade-off, with minimal degradation in predictive accuracy. The datasets and source code will be publicly released at https://github.com/mtavassoli/GNN-FC.

### [187] [Risk-Entropic Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03078)
*Vahid R. Ramezani,Benjamin Englard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using tilted (entropic) risk in Flow Matching (FM) to better handle rare or high-loss events, improving geometric structure recovery compared to standard FM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard FM's mean squared error loss overlooks higher-order conditional information like variance and skewness, which encode important data manifold details. Tilted risk addresses this by emphasizing rare events.

Method: The study applies a log-exponential transform to the FM loss, creating a tilted risk loss. This loss bounds a conditional entropic FM objective and introduces interpretable corrections (covariance preconditioning and skew tail terms).

Result: Experiments on synthetic data show the risk-sensitive loss enhances statistical metrics and recovers geometric structure more accurately than standard FM.

Conclusion: Tilted risk loss improves FM by capturing higher-order data manifold features, proving effective for ambiguous and tail-heavy scenarios.

Abstract: Tilted (entropic) risk, obtained by applying a log-exponential transform to a base loss, is a well established tool in statistics and machine learning for emphasizing rare or high loss events while retaining a tractable optimization problem. In this work, our aim is to interpret its structure for Flow Matching (FM). FM learns a velocity field that transports samples from a simple source distribution to data by integrating an ODE. In rectified FM, training pairs are obtained by linearly interpolating between a source sample and a data sample, and a neural velocity field is trained to predict the straight line displacement using a mean squared error loss. This squared loss collapses all velocity targets that reach the same space-time point into a single conditional mean, thereby ignoring higher order conditional information (variance, skewness, multi-modality) that encodes fine geometric structure about the data manifold and minority branches. We apply the standard risk-sensitive (log-exponential) transform to the conditional FM loss and show that the resulting tilted risk loss is a natural upper-bound on a meaningful conditional entropic FM objective defined at each space-time point. Furthermore, we show that a small order expansion of the gradient of this conditional entropic objective yields two interpretable first order corrections: covariance preconditioning of the FM residual, and a skew tail term that favors asymmetric or rare branches. On synthetic data designed to probe ambiguity and tails, the resulting risk-sensitive loss improves statistical metrics and recovers geometric structure more faithfully than standard rectified FM.

TL;DR: ALARM is a UQ-supported MLLM-based VAD framework integrating reasoning chain, self-reflection, and MLLM ensemble for robust anomaly detection in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in detecting highly contextual and ambiguous anomalies in complex environments, requiring uncertainty quantification (UQ) for reliable MLLM-based VAD systems.

Method: ALARM integrates UQ with quality-assurance techniques (reasoning chain, self-reflection, MLLM ensemble) via a probabilistic inference pipeline.

Result: Empirical evaluations on smart-home and wound image data show ALARM's superior performance and domain versatility.

Conclusion: ALARM demonstrates robust and accurate VAD capabilities, proving its generic applicability for reliable decision-making across domains.

Abstract: The advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has greatly stimulated research interest in developing multi-modal LLM (MLLM)-based visual anomaly detection (VAD) algorithms that can be deployed in complex environments. The challenge is that in these complex environments, the anomalies are sometimes highly contextual and also ambiguous, and thereby, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a crucial capacity for an MLLM-based VAD system to succeed. In this paper, we introduce our UQ-supported MLLM-based VAD framework called ALARM. ALARM integrates UQ with quality-assurance techniques like reasoning chain, self-reflection, and MLLM ensemble for robust and accurate performance and is designed based on a rigorous probabilistic inference pipeline and computational process. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted using the real-world smart-home benchmark data and wound image classification data, which shows ALARM's superior performance and its generic applicability across different domains for reliable decision-making.

*Mainak Singha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECLIPSE detects hallucinations in LLMs by analyzing semantic entropy and evidence capacity, outperforming baselines in financial QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder safe deployment in high-stakes domains, prompting the need for a robust detection framework.

Method: ECLIPSE combines entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with perplexity decomposition to assess how models use retrieved evidence.

Result: ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC 0.89 and AP 0.90 in financial QA, outperforming baselines. Its effectiveness relies on token-level uncertainties.

Conclusion: ECLIPSE shows promise but requires broader validation across domains and natural hallucinations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce fluent but unsupported answers - hallucinations - limiting safe deployment in high-stakes domains. We propose ECLIPSE, a framework that treats hallucination as a mismatch between a model's semantic entropy and the capacity of available evidence. We combine entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with a novel perplexity decomposition that measures how models use retrieved evidence. We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum. We evaluate on a controlled financial question answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (n=200 balanced samples with synthetic hallucinations), where ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, substantially outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50). A controlled ablation with Claude-3-Haiku, which lacks token-level log probabilities, shows AUC dropping to 0.59 with coefficient magnitudes decreasing by 95% - demonstrating that ECLIPSE is a logprob-native mechanism whose effectiveness depends on calibrated token-level uncertainties. The perplexity decomposition features exhibit the largest learned coefficients, confirming that evidence utilization is central to hallucination detection. We position this work as a controlled mechanism study; broader validation across domains and naturally occurring hallucinations remains future work.

*Shuvom Sadhuka,Drew Prinster,Clara Fannjiang,Gabriele Scalia,Aviv Regev,Hanchen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-valuator is a method converting heuristic verifier scores into statistically valid decision rules for evaluating agentic AI trajectories, ensuring control over false alarm rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verifiers lack guarantees of correctness, prompting the need for a method with statistical validity to evaluate agent trajectories.

Method: Frames trajectory evaluation as sequential hypothesis testing using e-processes, enabling online monitoring and termination of problematic trajectories.

Result: Outperforms other strategies in statistical power and false alarm rate control across multiple datasets and agents, while saving tokens.

Conclusion: E-valuator offers a lightweight, model-agnostic framework for reliable agentic system deployment with statistical guarantees.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems execute a sequence of actions, such as reasoning steps or tool calls, in response to a user prompt. To evaluate the success of their trajectories, researchers have developed verifiers, such as LLM judges and process-reward models, to score the quality of each action in an agent's trajectory. Although these heuristic scores can be informative, there are no guarantees of correctness when used to decide whether an agent will yield a successful output. Here, we introduce e-valuator, a method to convert any black-box verifier score into a decision rule with provable control of false alarm rates. We frame the problem of distinguishing successful trajectories (that is, a sequence of actions that will lead to a correct response to the user's prompt) and unsuccessful trajectories as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. E-valuator builds on tools from e-processes to develop a sequential hypothesis test that remains statistically valid at every step of an agent's trajectory, enabling online monitoring of agents over arbitrarily long sequences of actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that e-valuator provides greater statistical power and better false alarm rate control than other strategies across six datasets and three agents. We additionally show that e-valuator can be used for to quickly terminate problematic trajectories and save tokens. Together, e-valuator provides a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that converts verifier heuristics into decisions rules with statistical guarantees, enabling the deployment of more reliable agentic systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SISR introduces a unified nonlinear explanation framework addressing Shapley values' additivity assumption and sparsity issues, improving computational efficiency and attribution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in Shapley values: non-additive worth functions and costly sparsity attainment.

Method: Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR) learns monotonic transformations and enforces L0 sparsity.

Result: SISR recovers transformations effectively, handles noise, and stabilizes attributions across payoff schemes.

Conclusion: SISR advances nonlinear explainability with theoretical grounding and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Shapley values, a gold standard for feature attribution in Explainable AI, face two primary challenges. First, the canonical Shapley framework assumes that the worth function is additive, yet real-world payoff constructions--driven by non-Gaussian distributions, heavy tails, feature dependence, or domain-specific loss scales--often violate this assumption, leading to distorted attributions. Secondly, achieving sparse explanations in high dimensions by computing dense Shapley values and then applying ad hoc thresholding is prohibitively costly and risks inconsistency. We introduce Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a unified nonlinear explanation framework. SISR simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity--obviating the need for a closed-form specification--and enforces an L0 sparsity constraint on the Shapley vector, enhancing computational efficiency in large feature spaces. Its optimization algorithm leverages Pool-Adjacent-Violators for efficient isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for support selection, yielding implementation ease and global convergence guarantees. Analysis shows that SISR recovers the true transformation in a wide range of scenarios and achieves strong support recovery even in high noise. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate that irrelevant features and inter-feature dependencies can induce a true payoff transformation that deviates substantially from linearity. Experiments in regression, logistic regression, and tree ensembles demonstrate that SISR stabilizes attributions across payoff schemes, correctly filters irrelevant features while standard Shapley values suffer severe rank and sign distortions. By unifying nonlinear transformation estimation with sparsity pursuit, SISR advances the frontier of nonlinear explainability, providing a theoretically grounded and practical attribution framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable trustworthy decision-making in SHM by providing spatially resolved full-field uncertainties for high-value assets.

Method: Integrates PCA, Bayesian neural network (BNN), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to map sparse strain gauge data onto PCA modes for strain reconstruction and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieves accurate strain reconstruction (R² > 0.9) and real-time uncertainty fields, diagnosing noise-induced or model-driven uncertainties locally.

Conclusion: The framework advances SHM toward reliable digital twin deployment and risk-aware diagnostics.

Abstract: Reliable real-time analysis of sensor data is essential for structural health monitoring (SHM) of high-value assets, yet a major challenge is to obtain spatially resolved full-field aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties for trustworthy decision-making. We present an integrated SHM framework that combines principal component analysis (PCA), a Bayesian neural network (BNN), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference, mapping sparse strain gauge measurements onto leading PCA modes to reconstruct full-field strain distributions with uncertainty quantification. The framework was validated through cyclic four-point bending tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with varying crack lengths, achieving accurate strain field reconstruction (R squared value > 0.9) while simultaneously producing real-time uncertainty fields. A key contribution is that the BNN yields robust full-field strain reconstructions from noisy experimental data with crack-induced strain singularities, while also providing explicit representations of two complementary uncertainty fields. Considered jointly in full-field form, the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty fields make it possible to diagnose at a local level, whether low-confidence regions are driven by data-inherent issues or by model-related limitations, thereby supporting reliable decision-making. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework advances SHM toward trustworthy digital twin deployment and risk-aware structural diagnostics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoDE, a modality-decoupled architecture to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Unified Multimodal Generative Models (UMGMs) by addressing inter- and intra-modal gradient conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UMGMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting during continual learning, especially inter-modal forgetting, which is unexplored. The paper aims to address this.

Method: Proposes Modality-Decoupled Experts (MoDE), isolating modality-specific updates and using knowledge distillation to prevent forgetting while preserving capabilities.

Result: MoDE outperforms prior methods in mitigating both inter- and intra-modal forgetting across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: MoDE effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in UMGMs by decoupling modalities and leveraging distillation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Generative Models (UMGMs) unify visual understanding and image generation within a single autoregressive framework. However, their ability to continually learn new tasks is severely hindered by catastrophic forgetting, both within a modality (intra-modal) and across modalities (inter-modal). While intra-modal forgetting has been studied in prior continual learning (CL) work, inter-modal forgetting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify and empirically validate this phenomenon in UMGMs and provide a theoretical explanation rooted in gradient conflict between modalities. To address both intra- and inter-modal forgetting, we propose Modality-Decoupled Experts (MoDE), a lightweight and scalable architecture that isolates modality-specific updates to mitigate the gradient conflict and leverages knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting and preserve pre-trained capabilities. Unlike previous CL methods that remain modality-coupled and suffer from modality gradient conflict, MoDE explicitly decouples modalities to prevent interference. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoDE significantly mitigates both inter- and intra-modal forgetting, outperforming prior CL baselines in unified multimodal generation settings. Codes will be publicly available: https://github.com/Christina200/MoDE-official.git

Motivation: Interpreting NMR spectra manually is time-consuming and requires expertise. Automating this process can accelerate molecular discovery.

Method: ChefNMR uses an atomic diffusion model with a non-equivariant transformer architecture, trained on simulated NMR spectra of 111,000 natural products.

Result: ChefNMR predicts structures with over 65% accuracy for challenging natural products.

Conclusion: This work advances automation in small-molecule structure elucidation and demonstrates deep learning's potential in molecular discovery.

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a cornerstone technique for determining the structures of small molecules and is especially critical in the discovery of novel natural products and clinical therapeutics. Yet, interpreting NMR spectra remains a time-consuming, manual process requiring extensive domain expertise. We introduce ChefNMR (CHemical Elucidation From NMR), an end-to-end framework that directly predicts an unknown molecule's structure solely from its 1D NMR spectra and chemical formula. We frame structure elucidation as conditional generation from an atomic diffusion model built on a non-equivariant transformer architecture. To model the complex chemical groups found in natural products, we generated a dataset of simulated 1D NMR spectra for over 111,000 natural products. ChefNMR predicts the structures of challenging natural product compounds with an unsurpassed accuracy of over 65%. This work takes a significant step toward solving the grand challenge of automating small-molecule structure elucidation and highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating molecular discovery.

TL;DR: A framework using VQ-VAE for unsupervised viral variant detection in wastewater genomics, overcoming computational challenges like noise and fragmented reads without needing reference genomes or labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with novel mutations and require heavy resources. Wastewater genomics lacks labeled data, necessitating an unsupervised approach.

Method: Extends VQ-VAE with masked reconstruction pretraining and contrastive learning for robustness and discriminative embeddings.

Result: Achieves 99.52% token-level accuracy, 56.33% exact sequence match rate, and improves clustering scores significantly with contrastive fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable, interpretable genomic surveillance for public health.

Abstract: Wastewater-based genomic surveillance has emerged as a powerful tool for population-level viral monitoring, offering comprehensive insights into circulating viral variants across entire communities. However, this approach faces significant computational challenges stemming from high sequencing noise, low viral coverage, fragmented reads, and the complete absence of labeled variant annotations. Traditional reference-based variant calling pipelines struggle with novel mutations and require extensive computational resources. We present a comprehensive framework for unsupervised viral variant detection using Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) that learns discrete codebooks of genomic patterns from k-mer tokenized sequences without requiring reference genomes or variant labels. Our approach extends the base VQ-VAE architecture with masked reconstruction pretraining for robustness to missing data and contrastive learning for highly discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequencing data comprising approximately 100,000 reads, our VQ-VAE achieves 99.52% mean token-level accuracy and 56.33% exact sequence match rate while maintaining 19.73% codebook utilization (101 of 512 codes active), demonstrating efficient discrete representation learning. Contrastive fine-tuning with different projection dimensions yields substantial clustering improvements: 64-dimensional embeddings achieve +35% Silhouette score improvement (0.31 to 0.42), while 128-dimensional embeddings achieve +42% improvement (0.31 to 0.44), clearly demonstrating the impact of embedding dimensionality on variant discrimination capability. Our reference-free framework provides a scalable, interpretable approach to genomic surveillance with direct applications to public health monitoring.

*Anthony Liang,Jonathan Berant,Adam Fisch,Abhimanyu Goyal,Kalpesh Krishna,Jacob Eisenstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes interleaved reasoning (IR) and its specialization Plantain to improve model-user interaction by providing incremental feedback, reducing latency, and enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models waste user time by not revealing intermediate reasoning steps, leading to frustration when corrections are needed. The goal is to mimic human conversational grounding.

Method: Interleaved reasoning alternates thinking and surfacing responses. Plantain further introduces a step-by-step plan as the first intermediate response for early feedback.

Result: Plantain improves pass@1 by ~6% in math and coding tasks and reduces time-to-first-response by over 60% compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: IR and Plantain enhance user experience and model performance by enabling early feedback and reducing perceived latency.

Abstract: Reasoning models often spend a significant amount of time thinking before they generate a visible response. In the meantime, they do not give the user any hints as to whether their reasoning is on the right track, and do not give the user any recourse to stop and correct them if their reasoning is flawed. This creates a frustrating, but unfortunately common, experience: the user's time is wasted while the model reasons from a false premise that could have easily been corrected. In contrast, human speakers typically perform lightweight, incremental grounding acts to ensure that participants in the conversation are on the same page; here we ask if language models can learn to leverage a similar type of behavior? With this motivation, we propose interleaved reasoning (IR), in which the model alternates between thinking and surfacing intermediate responses, as an alternative to the standard "think-then-answer" approach. By providing useful information to the user earlier, IR reduces perceived latency, the time a user waits for an initial output, without compromising the quality of the final response. We further introduce a specialization of interleaved reasoning, Plantain (Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving), where the first intermediate response is an explicit, step-by-step plan for executing the task. This plan-first strategy allows for user intervention and early feedback for subsequent reasoning steps. We demonstrate that Plantain yields an ~6% improvement in pass@1 across several challenging math reasoning and coding benchmarks, while reducing time-to-first-response by over 60% relative to think-then-answer baselines.

Motivation: Addressing the limitations of policy-gradient methods in environments requiring memory.

Method: Development of algorithms for learning policies with memory, tested on large POMDPs.

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods have received increased attention recently as a mechanism for learning to act in partially observable environments. They have shown promise for problems admitting memoryless policies but have been less successful when memory is required. In this paper we develop several improved algorithms for learning policies with memory in an infinite-horizon setting -- directly when a known model of the environment is available, and via simulation otherwise. We compare these algorithms on some large POMDPs, including noisy robot navigation and multi-agent problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address distributed decision-making in network routing using reinforcement learning, focusing on cooperative behavior without inter-agent communication.

Method: Applied OLPOMDP, a policy-gradient RL algorithm, to simulated network routing under various network models. Reward shaping was used to penalize sub-optimal behavior.

Result: Distributed agents learned cooperative behavior and avoided detrimental actions, with reward shaping significantly improving convergence rates.

Conclusion: OLPOMDP effectively solves network routing problems by enabling cooperative learning among agents and optimizing reward signals for faster convergence.

Abstract: Network routing is a distributed decision problem which naturally admits numerical performance measures, such as the average time for a packet to travel from source to destination. OLPOMDP, a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, was successfully applied to simulated network routing under a number of network models. Multiple distributed agents (routers) learned co-operative behavior without explicit inter-agent communication, and they avoided behavior which was individually desirable, but detrimental to the group's overall performance. Furthermore, shaping the reward signal by explicitly penalizing certain patterns of sub-optimal behavior was found to dramatically improve the convergence rate.

TL;DR: Perch 2.0 outperforms other bioacoustics models in few-shot transfer learning for marine mammal classification despite lacking marine mammal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate Perch 2.0's performance on marine mammal tasks given its limited training data in this domain.

Method: Use linear probing with embeddings from Perch 2.0 and compare against other bioacoustics models like Perch 1.0, SurfPerch, AVES-bio, BirdAVES, and Birdnet V2.3.

Result: Perch 2.0 embeddings show consistently high performance, generally surpassing alternatives for few-shot transfer learning.

Conclusion: Perch 2.0 is recommended for developing marine mammal classifiers when labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: Perch 2.0 is a supervised bioacoustics foundation model pretrained on 14,597 species, including birds, mammals, amphibians, and insects, and has state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Given that Perch 2.0 includes almost no marine mammal audio or classes in the training data, we evaluate Perch 2.0 performance on marine mammal and underwater audio tasks through few-shot transfer learning. We perform linear probing with the embeddings generated from this foundation model and compare performance to other pretrained bioacoustics models. In particular, we compare Perch 2.0 with previous multispecies whale, Perch 1.0, SurfPerch, AVES-bio, BirdAVES, and Birdnet V2.3 models, which have open-source tools for transfer-learning and agile modeling. We show that the embeddings from the Perch 2.0 model have consistently high performance for few-shot transfer learning, generally outperforming alternative embedding models on the majority of tasks, and thus is recommended when developing new linear classifiers for marine mammal classification with few labeled examples.

TL;DR: SPARK is a three-stage framework using synthetic training data from verifier models to fine-tune generative process reward models, outperforming ground-truth methods in mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of expensive step-level annotations or ground truth references in process reward models (PRMs) for reinforcement learning.

Method: A three-stage approach: 1) Generate diverse solutions and verify them via scaling techniques. 2) Use verification outputs to train generative PRMs. 3) Apply PRM-CoT as reward signals in RL with format constraints to prevent reward hacking.

Result: Achieves 67.5 F1 on ProcessBench and 47.4% accuracy across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming ground-truth-based methods.

Conclusion: SPARK enables reference-free RL training superior to ground-truth methods, expanding applications in domains lacking verifiable answers.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) that provide dense, step-level feedback have shown promise for reinforcement learning, yet their adoption remains limited by the need for expensive step-level annotations or ground truth references. We propose SPARK: a three-stage framework where in the first stage a generator model produces diverse solutions and a verifier model evaluates them using parallel scaling (self-consistency) and sequential scaling (meta-critique). In the second stage, we use these verification outputs as synthetic training data to fine-tune generative process reward models, which subsequently serve as reward signals during training. We show that aggregating multiple independent verifications at the step level produces training data for process reward models that surpass ground-truth outcome supervision, achieving 67.5 F1 on ProcessBench (a benchmark for identifying erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning) compared to 66.4 for reference-guided training and 61.9 for GPT-4o. In the final stage, we apply our generative PRM with chain-of-thought verification (PRM-CoT) as the reward model in RL experiments on mathematical reasoning, and introduce format constraints to prevent reward hacking. Using Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we achieve 47.4% average accuracy across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming ground-truth-based RLVR (43.9%). Our work enables reference-free RL training that exceeds ground-truth methods, opening new possibilities for domains lacking verifiable answers or accessible ground truth.

### [203] [Too Late to Recall: Explaining the Two-Hop Problem in Multimodal Knowledge Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03276)
*Constantin Venhoff,Ashkan Khakzar,Sonia Joseph,Philip Torr,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with factual recall compared to their LLM backbones due to late entity resolution, but early entity resolution and methods like prompting can recover performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why VLMs often degrade in factual recall compared to their LLM backbones and how multimodal fine-tuning affects existing LLM mechanisms.

Method: Benchmarked 14 VLMs of varying architectures and sizes, used attribution patching, activation patching, and probing to analyze performance degradation.

Result: 11 of 14 VLMs showed factual recall degradation due to late entity resolution; high-performing VLMs resolved entities early. Performance recovery was achieved via patching and prompting.

Conclusion: Early entity resolution is critical for VLMs to reuse LLM mechanisms effectively, and mechanistic analysis can uncover multimodal alignment failures.

Abstract: Training vision language models (VLMs) aims to align visual representations from a vision encoder with the textual representations of a pretrained large language model (LLM). However, many VLMs exhibit reduced factual recall performance compared to their LLM backbones, raising the question of how effective multimodal fine-tuning is at extending existing mechanisms within the LLM to visual inputs. We argue that factual recall based on visual inputs requires VLMs to solve a two-hop problem: (1) forming entity representations from visual inputs, and (2) recalling associated factual knowledge based on these entity representations. By benchmarking 14 VLMs with various architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), sizes (7B-124B parameters), and training setups on factual recall tasks against their original LLM backbone models, we find that 11 of 14 models exhibit factual recall degradation. We select three models with high and two models with low performance degradation, and use attribution patching, activation patching, and probing to show that degraded VLMs struggle to use the existing factual recall circuit of their LLM backbone, because they resolve the first hop too late in the computation. In contrast, high-performing VLMs resolve entity representations early enough to reuse the existing factual recall mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate two methods to recover performance: patching entity representations from the LLM backbone into the VLM, and prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning. Our results highlight that the speed of early entity resolution critically determines how effective VLMs are in using preexisting LLM mechanisms. More broadly, our work illustrates how mechanistic analysis can explain and unveil systematic failures in multimodal alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large, field-resolved datasets hampers progress in accurate aerodynamic prediction and reproducible inverse design for aircraft. This paper addresses this gap.

Method: The dataset includes 12,000+ geometries simulated via steady RANS CFD, providing integrated coefficients and dense surface fields. Benchmarks involve six model families for forward prediction and a conditional diffusion model for inverse design.

Result: The dataset enables standardized benchmarking for aerodynamic surrogates and inverse design, offering a unified protocol for fair comparison across methods.

Conclusion: BlendedNet++ aims to catalyze reproducible research in aerodynamics and inverse design, with resources set for release upon acceptance.

Abstract: Despite progress in machine learning-based aerodynamic surrogates, the scarcity of large, field-resolved datasets limits progress on accurate pointwise prediction and reproducible inverse design for aircraft. We introduce BlendedNet++, a large-scale aerodynamic dataset and benchmark focused on blended wing body (BWB) aircraft. The dataset contains over 12,000 unique geometries, each simulated at a single flight condition, yielding 12,490 aerodynamic results for steady RANS CFD. For every case, we provide (i) integrated force/moment coefficients CL, CD, CM and (ii) dense surface fields of pressure and skin friction coefficients Cp and (Cfx, Cfy, Cfz). Using this dataset, we standardize a forward-surrogate benchmark to predict pointwise fields across six model families: GraphSAGE, GraphUNet, PointNet, a coordinate Transformer (Transolver-style), a FiLMNet (coordinate MLP with feature-wise modulation), and a Graph Neural Operator Transformer (GNOT). Finally, we present an inverse design task of achieving a specified lift-to-drag ratio under fixed flight conditions, implemented via a conditional diffusion model. To assess performance, we benchmark this approach against gradient-based optimization on the same surrogate and a diffusion-optimization hybrid that first samples with the conditional diffusion model and then further optimizes the designs. BlendedNet++ provides a unified forward and inverse protocol with multi-model baselines, enabling fair, reproducible comparison across architectures and optimization paradigms. We expect BlendedNet++ to catalyze reproducible research in field-level aerodynamics and inverse design; resources (dataset, splits, baselines, and scripts) will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy issues in traditional HAR systems by avoiding centralized data storage and to enable joint model learning across devices with different sampling frequencies.

Method: The method involves using multi-frequency Federated Learning (FL) tailored for head-worn devices (e.g., earbuds, smart glasses), a less explored area in HAR compared to smartphones or smartwatches.

Result: Results demonstrate improvements over frequency-specific approaches on two datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed multi-frequency FL-HAR framework.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) benefits various application domains, including health and elderly care. Traditional HAR involves constructing pipelines reliant on centralized user data, which can pose privacy concerns as they necessitate the uploading of user data to a centralized server. This work proposes multi-frequency Federated Learning (FL) to enable: (1) privacy-aware ML; (2) joint ML model learning across devices with varying sampling frequency. We focus on head-worn devices (e.g., earbuds and smart glasses), a relatively unexplored domain compared to traditional smartwatch- or smartphone-based HAR. Results have shown improvements on two datasets against frequency-specific approaches, indicating a promising future in the multi-frequency FL-HAR task. The proposed network's implementation is publicly available for further research and development.

### [206] [ASPEN: An Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network for Ginzburg-Landau Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03290)
*Julian Evan Chrisnanto,Nurfauzi Fadillah,Yulison Herry Chrisnanto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASPEN, an adaptive spectral neural network, improves PINNs by dynamically tuning its spectral basis, solving complex PDEs like CGLE where traditional PINNs fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PINNs struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear PDEs due to spectral bias, prompting the need for adaptive architectures like ASPEN.

Method: ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features, dynamically adjusting its spectral basis during training to capture required frequencies.

Result: ASPEN accurately solves the CGLE, achieving low residuals (5.10 x 10^-3) and capturing emergent physical properties, unlike failing standard PINNs.

Conclusion: ASPEN's adaptive spectral basis offers a robust solver for complex dynamical systems, expanding ML applications in challenging physical domains.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful, mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regime transitions disrupt stationarity in time series, making calibrated uncertainty crucial alongside point accuracy.

Method: Couples Deep Switching State Space Models with Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) and Aggregated ACI (AgACI), and introduces a conformal wrapper for sequence baselines.

Result: Conformalized forecasters achieve near-nominal coverage with competitive accuracy and improved band efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide reliable uncertainty quantification under nonstationarity and model misspecification.

Abstract: Regime transitions routinely break stationarity in time series, making calibrated uncertainty as important as point accuracy. We study distribution-free uncertainty for regime-switching forecasting by coupling Deep Switching State Space Models with Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) and its aggregated variant (AgACI). We also introduce a unified conformal wrapper that sits atop strong sequence baselines including S4, MC-Dropout GRU, sparse Gaussian processes, and a change-point local model to produce online predictive bands with finite-sample marginal guarantees under nonstationarity and model misspecification. Across synthetic and real datasets, conformalized forecasters achieve near-nominal coverage with competitive accuracy and generally improved band efficiency.

*Pengfei Hu,Fan Ming,Xiaoxue Han,Chang Lu,Yue Ning,Dan Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HydroDCM is a scalable domain generalization framework for cross-reservoir inflow forecasting that leverages spatial metadata to guide adversarial learning and adapts features for unseen reservoirs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models struggle with domain shift in reservoir inflow prediction due to unique patterns and indirect spatial influences, limiting conventional DG techniques.

Method: HydroDCM uses reservoir spatial metadata to create pseudo-domain labels for adversarial learning of invariant temporal features and employs light-weight conditioning layers for target-specific adaptation.

Result: Tests on 30 reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin show HydroDCM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HydroDCM effectively addresses domain shift in hydrological systems by combining invariant feature learning with location-specific adaptation, offering a scalable solution.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in reservoir inflow prediction, yet their performance often deteriorates when applied to different reservoirs due to distributional differences, referred to as the domain shift problem. Domain generalization (DG) solutions aim to address this issue by extracting domain-invariant representations that mitigate errors in unseen domains. However, in hydrological settings, each reservoir exhibits unique inflow patterns, while some metadata beyond observations like spatial information exerts indirect but significant influence. This mismatch limits the applicability of conventional DG techniques to many-domain hydrological systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose HydroDCM, a scalable DG framework for cross-reservoir inflow forecasting. Spatial metadata of reservoirs is used to construct pseudo-domain labels that guide adversarial learning of invariant temporal features. During inference, HydroDCM adapts these features through light-weight conditioning layers informed by the target reservoir's metadata, reconciling DG's invariance with location-specific adaptation. Experiment results on 30 real-world reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art DG baselines under many-domain conditions and remains computationally efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tabular foundation models (TFMs) pretrained on synthetic data show promise, with Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM) improving performance via adversarial training, achieving up to 6% better AUC than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance TFM robustness and performance by leveraging synthetic data generators and adversarial training, focusing on challenging datasets.

Method: Introduces RTFM, a model-agnostic adversarial training framework using an optimality gap measure to adapt synthetic data generators during training.

Result: RTFM improves TabPFN V2 performance by up to 6% in mean normalized AUC over original TabPFN and baselines, using <100k synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: RTFM demonstrates the potential of targeted adversarial training with synthetic data for advancing TFMs.

Abstract: The development of tabular foundation models (TFMs) has accelerated in recent years, showing strong potential to outperform traditional ML methods for structured data. A key finding is that TFMs can be pretrained entirely on synthetic datasets, opening opportunities to design data generators that encourage desirable model properties. Prior work has mainly focused on crafting high-quality priors over generators to improve overall pretraining performance. Our insight is that parameterizing the generator distribution enables an adversarial robustness perspective: during training, we can adapt the generator to emphasize datasets that are particularly challenging for the model. We formalize this by introducing an optimality gap measure, given by the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance as estimated by strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building on this idea, we propose Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training framework. Applied to the TabPFN V2 classifier, RTFM improves benchmark performance, with up to a 6% increase in mean normalized AUC over the original TabPFN and other baseline algorithms, while requiring less than 100k additional synthetic datasets. These results highlight a promising new direction for targeted adversarial training and fine-tuning of TFMs using synthetic data alone.

TL;DR: SAFLe is a novel federated learning framework that achieves non-linear expressivity while maintaining AFL's single-round efficiency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between model accuracy and communication efficiency in Federated Learning, especially for heterogeneous data.

Method: Introduces SAFLe with structured heads of bucketed features and sparse grouped embeddings, mathematically equivalent to high-dimensional linear regression.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming linear AFL and multi-round DeepAFL across benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAFLe provides an efficient, scalable solution for federated vision tasks, combining non-linear performance with single-round communication.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is plagued by two key challenges: high communication overhead and performance collapse on heterogeneous (non-IID) data. Analytic FL (AFL) provides a single-round, data distribution invariant solution, but is limited to linear models. Subsequent non-linear approaches, like DeepAFL, regain accuracy but sacrifice the single-round benefit. In this work, we break this trade-off. We propose SAFLe, a framework that achieves scalable non-linear expressivity by introducing a structured head of bucketed features and sparse, grouped embeddings. We prove this non-linear architecture is mathematically equivalent to a high-dimensional linear regression. This key equivalence allows SAFLe to be solved with AFL's single-shot, invariant aggregation law. Empirically, SAFLe establishes a new state-of-the-art for analytic FL, significantly outperforming both linear AFL and multi-round DeepAFL in accuracy across all benchmarks, demonstrating a highly efficient and scalable solution for federated vision.

*Hongseon Yeom,Jaeyoul Shin,Soojin Min,Jeongmin Yoon,Seunghak Yu,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) in deterministic ad auctions, addressing challenges like zero exposure probabilities for non-winning ads. It repurposes bid landscape models to derive robust propensity scores, enabling reliable evaluation with SNIPS. Validated on AuctionNet and real-world data, it achieves 92% MDA in CTR prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online A/B testing is resource-intensive and risky for ad auctions. OPE offers a rapid, offline alternative but fails in deterministic auction settings due to zero-probability exposure for non-winning ads. This motivates a framework tailored for deterministic environments.

Method: The paper repurposes bid landscape models to approximate propensity scores, enabling stable OPE estimators like SNIPS. This avoids the limitations of deterministic auction settings.

Result: The method achieves 92% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in CTR prediction, outperforming baselines and aligning closely with online A/B test results.

Conclusion: This work provides the first practical OPE framework for deterministic auctions, offering a cost-effective and reliable alternative to online experiments.

Abstract: Online A/B testing, the gold standard for evaluating new advertising policies, consumes substantial engineering resources and risks significant revenue loss from deploying underperforming variations. This motivates the use of Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) for rapid, offline assessment. However, applying OPE to ad auctions is fundamentally more challenging than in domains like recommender systems, where stochastic policies are common. In online ad auctions, it is common for the highest-bidding ad to win the impression, resulting in a deterministic, winner-takes-all setting. This results in zero probability of exposure for non-winning ads, rendering standard OPE estimators inapplicable. We introduce the first principled framework for OPE in deterministic auctions by repurposing the bid landscape model to approximate the propensity score. This model allows us to derive robust approximate propensity scores, enabling the use of stable estimators like Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) for counterfactual evaluation. We validate our approach on the AuctionNet simulation benchmark and against 2-weeks online A/B test from a large-scale industrial platform. Our method shows remarkable alignment with online results, achieving a 92\% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in CTR prediction, significantly outperforming the parametric baseline. MDA is the most critical metric for guiding deployment decisions, as it reflects the ability to correctly predict whether a new model will improve or harm performance. This work contributes the first practical and validated framework for reliable OPE in deterministic auction environments, offering an efficient alternative to costly and risky online experiments.

TL;DR: A2G introduces a dual gain framework for federated learning in quantum-classical networks, improving stability and accuracy under heterogeneous conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL in quantum-classical networks suffers from performance issues due to client heterogeneity, teleportation fidelity, and geometric mismatches. Traditional aggregation rules are insufficient.

Method: A2G uses dual gains (geometry and QoS) to regulate model blending and client importance, supported by convergence guarantees.

Result: A2G outperforms traditional methods (FedAvg, QoS-aware averaging, manifold-based aggregation) in stability and accuracy under noisy and heterogeneous conditions.

Conclusion: A2G is a versatile and effective solution for FL in quantum-classical networks, addressing key challenges.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) deployed over quantum enabled and heterogeneous classical networks faces significant performance degradation due to uneven client quality, stochastic teleportation fidelity, device instability, and geometric mismatch between local and global models. Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems. This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases. Experiments on a quantum classical hybrid testbed demonstrate improved stability and higher accuracy under heterogeneous and noisy conditions.

Motivation: Address challenges in IDS like heterogeneous traffic, evolving threats, and data imbalance by leveraging multimodal synthesis.

Method: Uses diffusion-based framework coupling tabular flow features with images via unified latent prior, training Transformer and CNN-based variational encoders with EDM denoiser.

Result: Shows significant improvements in fidelity, diversity, and downstream detection on CIC-IDS-2017 and NSL-KDD datasets compared to TabSyn and TabDDPM.

Conclusion: MAGE-ID effectively enhances multimodal IDS augmentation, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) face severe challenges due to heterogeneous network traffic, evolving cyber threats, and pronounced data imbalance between benign and attack flows. While generative models have shown promise in data augmentation, existing approaches are limited to single modalities and fail to capture cross-domain dependencies. This paper introduces MAGE-ID (Multimodal Attack Generator for Intrusion Detection), a diffusion-based generative framework that couples tabular flow features with their transformed images through a unified latent prior. By jointly training Transformer and CNN-based variational encoders with an EDM style denoiser, MAGE-ID achieves balanced and coherent multimodal synthesis. Evaluations on CIC-IDS-2017 and NSL-KDD demonstrate significant improvements in fidelity, diversity, and downstream detection performance over TabSyn and TabDDPM, highlighting the effectiveness of MAGE-ID for multimodal IDS augmentation.

*Lakshmi Jayalal,Sheetal Kalyani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tuning-free framework using Implicit Regularization (IR) avoids traditional parameter tuning or prior knowledge requirements for recovering jointly sparse signals in the MMV setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like M-OMP and M-FOCUSS require careful tuning or prior knowledge, limiting their practicality.

Method: Reparameterizes the estimation matrix to decouple shared row-support, applying gradient descent on factors to promote row-sparsity.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show convergence to row-sparse solutions; empirical results match established methods without tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is practical, outperforming traditional methods by eliminating tuning needs and leveraging implicit regularization.

Abstract: Recovering jointly sparse signals in the multiple measurement vectors (MMV) setting is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but traditional methods like multiple measurement vectors orthogonal matching pursuit (M-OMP) and multiple measurement vectors FOCal Underdetermined System Solver (M-FOCUSS) often require careful parameter tuning or prior knowledge of the sparsity of the signal and/or noise variance. We introduce a novel tuning-free framework that leverages Implicit Regularization (IR) from overparameterization to overcome this limitation. Our approach reparameterizes the estimation matrix into factors that decouple the shared row-support from individual vector entries. We show that the optimization dynamics inherently promote the desired row-sparse structure by applying gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective on these factors. We prove that with a sufficiently small and balanced initialization, the optimization dynamics exhibit a "momentum-like" effect, causing the norms of rows in the true support to grow significantly faster than others. This formally guarantees that the solution trajectory converges towards an idealized row-sparse solution. Additionally, empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to established methods without requiring any prior information or tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of GNNs and the performance gap in HDC-based methods for graph classification.

Method: Introduces Spike Diffusion for node identification and Associative Message Passing for neighborhood aggregation within HDC's vector space, avoiding gradient-based optimization.

Result: Achieves 4-5% higher accuracy than HDC baselines and matches GNNs on some datasets, with up to 450x faster training and robustness to low dimensionality (D=128).

Conclusion: VS-Graph offers a scalable, efficient alternative to GNNs for graph learning, suitable for resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Graph classification is a fundamental task in domains ranging from molecular property prediction to materials design. While graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance by learning expressive representations via message passing, they incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative, yet existing HDC-based graph methods typically struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs. In this work, we propose VS-Graph, a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that narrows the gap between the efficiency of HDC and the expressive power of message passing. VS-Graph introduces a Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and an Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation entirely within the high-dimensional vector space. Without gradient-based optimization or backpropagation, our method achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% on standard benchmarks such as MUTAG and DD. It also matches or exceeds the performance of the GNN baselines on several datasets while accelerating the training by a factor of up to 450x. Furthermore, VS-Graph maintains high accuracy even with the hypervector dimensionality reduced to D=128, demonstrating robustness under aggressive dimension compression and paving the way for ultra-efficient execution on edge and neuromorphic hardware.

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the need for full-stack alignment in AI systems, emphasizing concurrent alignment of systems and institutions with human values. It critiques current value representation methods and proposes thick models of value for better normative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure AI systems align not just with individual operators but also with broader societal values, avoiding misalignment that could lead to harmful outcomes.

Method: The proposed method involves thick models of value, which structure how values and norms are represented, enabling better distinction between enduring values and transient preferences, and supporting normative reasoning.

Result: The result is demonstrated through applications in five areas: AI value stewardship, normatively competent agents, win-win negotiation systems, meaning-preserving economic mechanisms, and democratic regulatory institutions.

Conclusion: The conclusion underscores the necessity of thick models of value to address current limitations in AI alignment and ensure beneficial societal outcomes.

Abstract: Beneficial societal outcomes cannot be guaranteed by aligning individual AI systems with the intentions of their operators or users. Even an AI system that is perfectly aligned to the intentions of its operating organization can lead to bad outcomes if the goals of that organization are misaligned with those of other institutions and individuals. For this reason, we need full-stack alignment, the concurrent alignment of AI systems and the institutions that shape them with what people value. This can be done without imposing a particular vision of individual or collective flourishing. We argue that current approaches for representing values, such as utility functions, preference orderings, or unstructured text, struggle to address these and other issues effectively. They struggle to distinguish values from other signals, to support principled normative reasoning, and to model collective goods. We propose thick models of value will be needed. These structure the way values and norms are represented, enabling systems to distinguish enduring values from fleeting preferences, to model the social embedding of individual choices, and to reason normatively, applying values in new domains. We demonstrate this approach in five areas: AI value stewardship, normatively competent agents, win-win negotiation systems, meaning-preserving economic mechanisms, and democratic regulatory institutions.

*Prakhar Gupta,Henry Conklin,Sarah-Jane Leslie,Andrew Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Studying the impact of explicit world-modeling objectives on Transformer representations and downstream performance, the paper finds improved state representations enhance reinforcement learning outcomes, especially in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how explicit world-modeling objectives influence Transformer representations and their effectiveness in reinforcement learning tasks.

Method: Comparative study using next-token prediction vs. two explicit world-modeling strategies (state-prediction and joint state-prediction + next-token) on a Rubik's Cube task, evaluated via linear probes and causal interventions.

Result: Explicit world-modeling produces more decodable and steerable state representations, leading to better reinforcement learning performance with GRPO, particularly in harder tasks.

Conclusion: Sharpening state representations through explicit world-modeling enhances post-training effectiveness for sequence-planning tasks.

Abstract: In this work we study how explicit world-modeling objectives affect the internal representations and downstream capability of Transformers across different training stages. We use a controlled 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube and ask: (1) how does explicitly pretraining a world model affect the model's latent representations, and (2) how does world-model quality affect the model's performance after reinforcement learning post-training? We compare standard next-token prediction to two explicit world-modeling strategies -- (i) state-prediction pretraining and (ii) a joint state-prediction + next-token objective -- and assess task performance after Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied as post-training. We evaluate the representation quality with linear probes and causal interventions. We find that explicit world-modeling yields more linearly decodable and causally steerable state representations. More importantly, we find that improved state representations lead to higher gains for GRPO, especially on harder cube states. Our results indicate that sharpening state representations can improve the effectiveness of post-training for sequence-planning tasks.

*Ziyi Ding,Xiao-Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaussDetect-LiNGAM is a new method for bivariate causal discovery that avoids Gaussianity tests by linking noise Gaussianity to residual independence in reverse regression, using robust kernel-based tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve causal discovery by eliminating fragile Gaussianity tests and enhancing reliability across diverse noise types and sample sizes.

Method: Leverages equivalence between Gaussian noise and residual independence in reverse regression, replacing Gaussianity tests with kernel-based independence tests.

Result: Validated equivalence maintains high consistency across noise types and sample sizes while reducing tests per decision.

Conclusion: GaussDetect-LiNGAM enhances LiNGAM's efficiency and practical applicability, making causal inference more reliable.

Abstract: We propose GaussDetect-LiNGAM, a novel approach for bivariate causal discovery that eliminates the need for explicit Gaussianity tests by leveraging a fundamental equivalence between noise Gaussianity and residual independence in the reverse regression. Under the standard LiNGAM assumptions of linearity, acyclicity, and exogeneity, we prove that the Gaussianity of the forward-model noise is equivalent to the independence between the regressor and residual in the reverse model. This theoretical insight allows us to replace fragile and sample-sensitive Gaussianity tests with robust kernel-based independence tests. Experimental results validate the equivalence and demonstrate that GaussDetect-LiNGAM maintains high consistency across diverse noise types and sample sizes, while reducing the number of tests per decision (TPD). Our method enhances both the efficiency and practical applicability of causal inference, making LiNGAM more accessible and reliable in real-world scenarios.

*Yuanbang Liang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether grokking-delayed generalization aids machine unlearning, finding post-grokking models enable more efficient forgetting, less collateral damage, and greater stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if grokking training regimes improve machine unlearning efficiency and effectiveness compared to early-stopped models.

Method: Comparison of standard unlearning methods applied pre- and post-grokking transition across vision (CNNs/ResNets) and language (transformer) tasks.

Result: Post-grokking models show better unlearning metrics: faster forgetting, less performance drop, and higher stability. Modular representations reduce gradient alignment between forget and retain subsets.

Conclusion: Training timing (pre- vs. post-grokking) is an independent factor enhancing unlearning methods, offering practical improvements without algorithmic changes.

Abstract: Grokking-delayed generalization that emerges well after a model has fit the training data-has been linked to robustness and representation quality. We ask whether this training regime also helps with machine unlearning, i.e., removing the influence of specified data without full retraining. We compare applying standard unlearning methods before versus after the grokking transition across vision (CNNs/ResNets on CIFAR, SVHN, and ImageNet) and language (a transformer on a TOFU-style setup). Starting from grokked checkpoints consistently yields (i) more efficient forgetting (fewer updates to reach a target forget level), (ii) less collateral damage (smaller drops on retained and test performance), and (iii) more stable updates across seeds, relative to early-stopped counterparts under identical unlearning algorithms. Analyses of features and curvature further suggest that post-grokking models learn more modular representations with reduced gradient alignment between forget and retain subsets, which facilitates selective forgetting. Our results highlight when a model is trained (pre- vs. post-grokking) as an orthogonal lever to how unlearning is performed, providing a practical recipe to improve existing unlearning methods without altering their algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework integrating recency and popularity opinion modalities for financial sentiment analysis, achieving superior accuracy over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for market forecasting but struggles with integrating diverse opinion modalities and capturing fine-grained interactions.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end framework using BERT for feature embedding and FMHCA for cross-modal attention, optimized via transformer and bilinear pooling for sentiment classification.

Result: Achieves 83.5% accuracy on a dataset of 837 companies, outperforming BERT+Transformer by 21%.

Conclusion: The framework enhances financial sentiment analysis, aiding better decision-making and risk management.

Abstract: In recent years, financial sentiment analysis of public opinion has become increasingly important for market forecasting and risk assessment. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate diverse opinion modalities and capture fine-grained interactions across them. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates two distinct modalities of financial opinions: recency modality (timely opinions) and popularity modality (trending opinions), through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis. While both modalities consist of textual data, they represent fundamentally different information channels: recency-driven market updates versus popularity-driven collective sentiment. Our model first uses BERT (Chinese-wwm-ext) for feature embedding and then employs our proposed Financial Multi-Head Cross-Attention (FMHCA) structure to facilitate information exchange between these distinct opinion modalities. The processed features are optimized through a transformer layer and fused using multimodal factored bilinear pooling for classification into negative, neutral, and positive sentiment. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive dataset covering 837 companies demonstrate that our approach achieves an accuracy of 83.5%, significantly outperforming baselines including BERT+Transformer by 21 percent. These results highlight the potential of our framework to support more accurate financial decision-making and risk management.

*Hongtao Hao,Joseph L. Austerweil*

TL;DR: BEBMS, a Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model, outperforms SuStaIn in disease subtype and progression tasks, offering more consistent results with Alzheimer's disease consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of SuStaIn and develop a more reliable model (BEBMS) for disease subtype and progression analysis.

Method: Developed BEBMS, tested against SuStaIn using synthetic data with model misspecification and applied both to Alzheimer's data.

Result: BEBMS significantly outperforms SuStaIn in ordering, staging, and subtype assignment, aligning better with Alzheimer's consensus.

Conclusion: BEBMS is a robust alternative to SuStaIn for disease progression modeling, validated by synthetic and real-world data.

Abstract: Chronic diseases often progress differently across patients. Rather than randomly varying, there are typically a small number of subtypes for how a disease progresses across patients. To capture this structured heterogeneity, the Subtype and Stage Inference Event-Based Model (SuStaIn) estimates the number of subtypes, the order of disease progression for each subtype, and assigns each patient to a subtype from primarily cross-sectional data. It has been widely applied to uncover the subtypes of many diseases and inform our understanding of them. But how robust is its performance? In this paper, we develop a principled Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model (BEBMS) and compare its performance to SuStaIn in a variety of synthetic data experiments with varied levels of model misspecification. BEBMS substantially outperforms SuStaIn across ordering, staging, and subtype assignment tasks. Further, we apply BEBMS and SuStaIn to a real-world Alzheimer's data set. We find BEBMS has results that are more consistent with the scientific consensus of Alzheimer's disease progression than SuStaIn.

TL;DR: SweetDeep, a lightweight neural network, uses wearable data for non-invasive type 2 diabetes screening, achieving 82.5% accuracy in real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable, cost-effective diabetes screening methods drives the exploration of non-invasive wearable-based solutions.

Method: SweetDeep trains on physiological and demographic data from 285 participants using Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 devices in free-living conditions.

Result: SweetDeep achieves 82.5% accuracy (82.1% macro-F1) with low expected calibration error (5.5%), improving to 84.5% when abstaining on low-confidence predictions.

Conclusion: Combining engineered features with compact architectures enables accurate, rapid diabetes detection in real-world wearable settings.

Abstract: The global rise in type 2 diabetes underscores the need for scalable and cost-effective screening methods. Current diagnosis requires biochemical assays, which are invasive and costly. Advances in consumer wearables have enabled early explorations of machine learning-based disease detection, but prior studies were limited to controlled settings. We present SweetDeep, a compact neural network trained on physiological and demographic data from 285 (diabetic and non-diabetic) participants in the EU and MENA regions, collected using Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 devices in free-living conditions over six days. Each participant contributed multiple 2-minute sensor recordings per day, totaling approximately 20 recordings per individual. Despite comprising fewer than 3,000 parameters, SweetDeep achieves 82.5% patient-level accuracy (82.1% macro-F1, 79.7% sensitivity, 84.6% specificity) under three-fold cross-validation, with an expected calibration error of 5.5%. Allowing the model to abstain on less than 10% of low-confidence patient predictions yields an accuracy of 84.5% on the remaining patients. These findings demonstrate that combining engineered features with lightweight architectures can support accurate, rapid, and generalizable detection of type 2 diabetes in real-world wearable settings.

*Hongtao Hao,Joseph L. Austerweil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Joint Progression Model (JPM) to address mixed pathologies in neurodegeneration, outperforming single-disease EBMs by 21% in ordering accuracy and aligning better with prior literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixed pathologies are common in neurodegeneration, but standard EBMs assume a single disease per individual, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: JPM treats single-disease trajectories as partial rankings and builds a prior over joint progressions, comparing variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, Mallows) on calibration, separation, and sharpness.

Result: All JPM variants are calibrated and achieve near-perfect separation; sharpness varies and is predictable. JPM improves ordering accuracy by ~21% over SA-EBM.

Conclusion: JPM effectively models mixed pathologies, with the Mallows variant showing consistency with prior literature on AD and VaD progression.

Abstract: Event-based models (EBMs) infer disease progression from cross-sectional data, and standard EBMs assume a single underlying disease per individual. In contrast, mixed pathologies are common in neurodegeneration. We introduce the Joint Progression Model (JPM), a probabilistic framework that treats single-disease trajectories as partial rankings and builds a prior over joint progressions. We study several JPM variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, and Mallows) and analyze three properties: (i) calibration -- whether lower model energy predicts smaller distance to the ground truth ordering; (ii) separation -- the degree to which sampled rankings are distinguishable from random permutations; and (iii) sharpness -- the stability of sampled aggregate rankings. All variants are calibrated, and all achieve near-perfect separation; sharpness varies by variant and is well-predicted by simple features of the input partial rankings (number and length of rankings, conflict, and overlap). In synthetic experiments, JPM improves ordering accuracy by roughly 21 percent over a strong EBM baseline (SA-EBM) that treats the joint disease as a single condition. Finally, using NACC, we find that the Mallows variant of JPM and the baseline model (SA-EBM) have results that are more consistent with prior literature on the possible disease progression of the mixed pathology of AD and VaD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the nonlinear inverse problem in EIT, which leads to artifacts and inaccurate contact reconstruction, by combining physics with deep learning.

Method: PhyDNN integrates the EIT forward model into the learning objective, minimizing discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth conductivity maps while enforcing PDE consistency. A differentiable forward-operator network enables efficient backpropagation.

Result: PhyDNN outperforms NOSER, TV, and standard DNNs in simulations and real tactile experiments, achieving fewer artifacts, sharper boundaries, and higher metric scores.

Conclusion: PhyDNN effectively enhances tomographic tactile sensing quality by improving physical plausibility and generalization.

Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) provides an attractive solution for large-area tactile sensing due to its minimal wiring and shape flexibility, but its nonlinear inverse problem often leads to severe artifacts and inaccurate contact reconstruction. This work presents PhyDNN, a physics-driven deep reconstruction framework that embeds the EIT forward model directly into the learning objective. By jointly minimizing the discrepancy between predicted and ground-truth conductivity maps and enforcing consistency with the forward PDE, PhyDNN reduces the black-box nature of deep networks and improves both physical plausibility and generalization. To enable efficient backpropagation, we design a differentiable forward-operator network that accurately approximates the nonlinear EIT response, allowing fast physics-guided training. Extensive simulations and real tactile experiments on a 16-electrode soft sensor show that PhyDNN consistently outperforms NOSER, TV, and standard DNNs in reconstructing contact shape, location, and pressure distribution. PhyDNN yields fewer artifacts, sharper boundaries, and higher metric scores, demonstrating its effectiveness for high-quality tomographic tactile sensing.

TL;DR: An adaptive sparse sensing framework combining variational autoencoder priors with reinforcement learning for sequential measurement selection outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like compressed sensing and optimal sensor placement have limitations in efficiency, adaptability, and reconstruction quality. Generative model-based compressed sensing improves but still uses suboptimal sampling.

Method: The proposed framework uses a variational autoencoder prior and reinforcement learning to adaptively select measurements sequentially.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior performance over compressed sensing, optimal sensor placement, and generative model-based approaches.

Conclusion: The adaptive framework effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering better reconstruction from sparse measurements.

Abstract: Compressed sensing enables sparse sampling but relies on generic bases and random measurements, limiting efficiency and reconstruction quality. Optimal sensor placement uses historcal data to design tailored sampling patterns, yet its fixed, linear bases cannot adapt to nonlinear or sample-specific variations. Generative model-based compressed sensing improves reconstruction using deep generative priors but still employs suboptimal random sampling. We propose an adaptive sparse sensing framework that couples a variational autoencoder prior with reinforcement learning to select measurements sequentially. Experiments show that this approach outperforms CS, OSP, and Generative model-based reconstruction from sparse measurements.

*Zhiming Xu,Baile Xu,Jian Zhao,Furao Shen,Suorong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DLC, a plugin extension paradigm using LoRA components for class-incremental learning, achieving high accuracy with minimal parameter increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIL methods suffer from forgetting or high parameter costs; DLC aims to address these by leveraging task-specific residuals and lightweight weighting.

Method: DLC uses LoRA to inject task-specific residuals into a base model and aggregates representations during inference, aided by a lightweight weighting unit.

Result: DLC improves accuracy by 8% on ImageNet-100 with only 4% of ResNet-18's parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under fixed memory.

Conclusion: DLC is an efficient, plug-and-play solution for CIL, balancing accuracy and parameter efficiency while mitigating interference.

Abstract: Existing class-incremental learning (CIL) approaches based on replay or knowledge distillation are often constrained by forgetting or the stability-plasticity dilemma. Some expansion-based approaches could achieve higher accuracy. However, they always require significant parameter increases. In this paper, we propose a plugin extension paradigm termed the Deployment of extra LoRA Components (DLC) for non-pre-trained CIL scenarios.We treat the feature extractor trained through replay or distillation as a base model with rich knowledge. For each task, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject task-specific residuals into the base model's deep layers. During inference, representations with task-specific residuals are aggregated to produce classification predictions. To mitigate interference from non-target LoRA plugins, we introduce a lightweight weighting unit. This unit learns to assign importance scores to different LoRA-tuned representations. Like downloadable contents in software, our method serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4 % of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8 % improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency. Moreover, it could surpass state-of-the-art methods under the fixed memory budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in current finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, introduces an attack (DiMRA) to reverse unlearning, and proposes a novel method (DiMUM) to enhance robustness by memorizing alternative data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety, privacy, and copyright concerns in diffusion models by improving machine unlearning methods.

Method: Proposes DiMRA attack to reverse unlearning and DiMUM method to memorize alternative data instead of forgetting.

Result: DiMRA successfully reverses unlearning, while DiMUM preserves generative performance and resists DiMRA.

Conclusion: DiMUM offers a robust solution to unlearning vulnerabilities in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their state-of-the-art performance in generating synthetic images. However, concerns related to safety, privacy, and copyright highlight the need for machine unlearning, which can make diffusion models forget specific training data and prevent the generation of sensitive or unwanted content. Current machine unlearning methods for diffusion models are primarily designed for conditional diffusion models and focus on unlearning specific data classes or features. Among these methods, finetuning-based machine unlearning methods are recognized for their efficiency and effectiveness, which update the parameters of pre-trained diffusion models by minimizing carefully designed loss functions. However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA), which can reverse the finetuning-based machine unlearning methods, posing a significant vulnerability of this kind of technique. Without prior knowledge of the unlearning elements, DiMRA optimizes the unlearned diffusion model on an auxiliary dataset to reverse the unlearning, enabling the model to regenerate previously unlearned elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel machine unlearning method for diffusion models, termed as Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM). Unlike traditional methods that focus on forgetting, DiMUM memorizes alternative data or features to replace targeted unlearning data or features in order to prevent generating such elements. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMRA in reversing state-of-the-art finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions. We extensively evaluate DiMUM, demonstrating its superior ability to preserve the generative performance of diffusion models while enhancing robustness against DiMRA.

*Florent Forest,Amaury Wei,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGNETS is an interpretable neural architecture for time series regression that learns human-understandable concepts without annotations, offering transparent insights into predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TSER models lack interpretability, and post-hoc techniques produce unreliable explanations. Inherently interpretable methods have limitations in supervision, feature interaction, and scalability.

Method: Proposes MAGNETS, which learns mask-based aggregations over input features to form interpretable concepts, combined additively for transparent predictions.

Result: MAGNETS provides clear insights into which features drive predictions and when they matter, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Conclusion: MAGNETS advances interpretable TSER by offering scalable, unsupervised concept learning and transparent reasoning.

Abstract: Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) refers to the task of predicting a continuous target variable from an input time series. It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data.
  To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process.

Motivation: The study aims to address the computational challenges and gaps in the literature surrounding Gaussian OT and IGW alignment, making these frameworks more practical for large-scale applications in data science and machine learning.

Method: The authors derive closed-form expressions for IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians and extend this to centered cases. They also reduce multimarginal OT with quadratic costs to a tractable problem and propose an efficient algorithm leveraging rank-deficiency constraints.

Result: The paper presents analytic solutions for IGW alignment and barycenters of centered Gaussians, along with tight bounds for uncentered cases. Their method is validated through applications in knowledge distillation and heterogeneous clustering.

Conclusion: The work significantly advances the practical use of Gaussian OT and IGW alignment by providing efficient solutions and demonstrating their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) alignment provide interpretable geometric frameworks for comparing, transforming, and aggregating heterogeneous datasets -- tasks ubiquitous in data science and machine learning. Because these frameworks are computationally expensive, large-scale applications often rely on closed-form solutions for Gaussian distributions under quadratic cost. This work provides a comprehensive treatment of Gaussian, quadratic cost OT and inner product GW (IGW) alignment, closing several gaps in the literature to broaden applicability. First, we treat the open problem of IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians on separable Hilbert spaces by giving a closed-form expression up to a quadratic optimization over unitary operators, for which we derive tight analytic upper and lower bounds. If at least one Gaussian measure is centered, the solution reduces to a fully closed-form expression, which we further extend to an analytic solution for the IGW barycenter between centered Gaussians. We also present a reduction of Gaussian multimarginal OT with pairwise quadratic costs to a tractable optimization problem and provide an efficient algorithm to solve it using a rank-deficiency constraint. To demonstrate utility, we apply our results to knowledge distillation and heterogeneous clustering on synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: A transformer-based deep learning model improves marine wind forecasts by correcting global NWP outputs using sparse ocean observations, achieving significant RMSE reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate marine wind forecasts are crucial for navigation and energy operations, but sparse and variable ocean observations make forecasting challenging.

Method: The model learns local correction patterns by assimilating in-situ observations to adjust GFS output, using a transformer with masking, cross-attention, and cyclical embeddings.

Result: The model reduces GFS wind RMSE by 45% at 1-hour and 13% at 48-hour lead times, with notable improvements along coastlines and shipping routes.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical, low-latency post-processing solution for correcting systematic NWP forecast errors.

Abstract: Accurate marine wind forecasts are essential for safe navigation, ship routing, and energy operations, yet they remain challenging because observations over the ocean are sparse, heterogeneous, and temporally variable. We reformulate wind forecasting as observation-informed correction of a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates. We evaluate our model over the Atlantic Ocean using observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as reference. The model reduces GFS 10-meter wind RMSE at all lead times up to 48 hours, achieving 45% improvement at 1-hour lead time and 13% improvement at 48-hour lead time. Spatial analyses reveal the most persistent improvements along coastlines and shipping routes, where observations are most abundant. The tokenized architecture naturally accommodates heterogeneous observing platforms (ships, buoys, tide gauges, and coastal stations) and produces both site-specific predictions and basin-scale gridded products in a single forward pass. These results demonstrate a practical, low-latency post-processing approach that complements NWP by learning to correct systematic forecast errors.

Abstract: This study proposes a method to enhance neural network performance when training data and application data are not very similar, e.g., out of distribution problems, as well as pattern and regime shifts. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Retrain the neural network towards reasonable subsets of the training data set and note down the resulting weight anomalies. 2) Choose reasonable predictors and derive a regression between the predictors and the weight anomalies. 3) Extrapolate the weights, and thereby the neural network, to the application data. We show and discuss this method in three use cases from the climate sciences, which include successful temporal, spatial and cross-domain extrapolations of neural networks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning framework combining cyclical encoding and hybrid LSTM-CNN architectures for better electricity consumption forecasting, showing improved accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate electricity forecasting is crucial for smart grid efficiency and demand management.

Method: Uses sine-cosine encodings for calendar attributes, integrates LSTM-CNN hybrid models, and employs MLP meta-learners for multistep forecasting.

Result: The model consistently outperforms baselines in RMSE and MAE across seven forecast horizons.

Conclusion: Combining cyclical encoding with hybrid deep learning architectures enhances short-term energy forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is essential for demand management and smart grid operations. This paper introduces a unified deep learning framework that integrates cyclical temporal encoding with hybrid LSTM-CNN architectures to enhance multistep energy forecasting. We systematically transform calendar-based attributes using sine cosine encodings to preserve periodic structure and evaluate their predictive relevance through correlation analysis. To exploit both long-term seasonal effects and short-term local patterns, we employ an ensemble model composed of an LSTM, a CNN, and a meta-learner of MLP regressors specialized for each forecast horizon. Using a one year national consumption dataset, we conduct an extensive experimental study including ablation analyses with and without cyclical encodings and calendar features and comparisons with established baselines from the literature. Results demonstrate consistent improvements across all seven forecast horizons, with our hybrid model achieving lower RMSE and MAE than individual architectures and prior methods. These findings confirm the benefit of combining cyclical temporal representations with complementary deep learning structures. To our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly evaluate temporal encodings, calendar-based features, and hybrid ensemble architectures within a unified short-term energy forecasting framework.

*Alex Ferrando,Xavier Suau,Jordi Gonzàlez,Pau Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSAS is a dynamic steering framework that adapts intervention strength based on input context, improving the balance between toxicity mitigation and utility preservation in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation steering methods apply uniform interventions, degrading performance unnecessarily. DSAS aims to selectively steer only when needed.

Method: DSAS dynamically scales steering interventions across layers and inputs, using context-dependent factors and joint optimization with steering functions.

Result: DSAS improves the Pareto front for toxicity mitigation and utility preservation, works with text-to-image models, and adds minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: DSAS enhances existing steering methods by adapting intervention strength, improving performance and interpretability without significant cost.

Abstract: Activation steering has emerged as a powerful method for guiding the behavior of generative models towards desired outcomes such as toxicity mitigation. However, most existing methods apply interventions uniformly across all inputs, degrading model performance when steering is unnecessary. We introduce Dynamically Scaled Activation Steering (DSAS), a method-agnostic steering framework that decouples when to steer from how to steer. DSAS adaptively modulates the strength of existing steering transformations across layers and inputs, intervening strongly only when undesired behavior is detected. At generation time, DSAS computes context-dependent scaling factors that selectively adjust the strength of any steering method. We also show how DSAS can be jointly optimized end-to-end together with the steering function. When combined with existing steering methods, DSAS consistently improves the Pareto front with respect to steering alone, achieving a better trade-off between toxicity mitigation and utility preservation. We further demonstrate DSAS's generality by applying it to a text-to-image diffusion model, showing how adaptive steering allows the modulation of specific concepts. Finally, DSAS introduces minimal computational overhead while improving interpretability, pinpointing which tokens require steering and by how much.

*Hao-Run Cai,Han-Jia Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in tabular machine learning caused by temporal distribution shifts, proposing a feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism to balance robustness and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal distribution shifts disrupt static models' generalization and cause adaptive models to overfit transient patterns, necessitating a dynamic approach.

Method: A feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism is introduced, conditioning feature representations on temporal context to align semantics and modulate statistical properties.

Result: The method achieves effective adaptation while balancing generalizability and adaptability, validated by benchmark evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism successfully handles temporal shifts in tabular data by aligning feature semantics over time.

Abstract: While tabular machine learning has achieved remarkable success, temporal distribution shifts pose significant challenges in real-world deployment, as the relationships between features and labels continuously evolve. Static models assume fixed mappings to ensure generalization, whereas adaptive models may overfit to transient patterns, creating a dilemma between robustness and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze key factors essential for constructing an effective dynamic mapping for temporal tabular data. We discover that evolving feature semantics-particularly objective and subjective meanings-introduce concept drift over time. Crucially, we identify that feature transformation strategies are able to mitigate discrepancies in feature representations across temporal stages. Motivated by these insights, we propose a feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism that conditions feature representations on temporal context, modulating statistical properties such as scale and skewness. By aligning feature semantics across time, our approach achieves a lightweight yet powerful adaptation, effectively balancing generalizability and adaptability. Benchmark evaluations validate the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal shifts in tabular data.

Result: The framework achieves stable training on NISQ devices, robust fraud detection via topological signatures, and outperforms baselines on metrics like ROC-AUC and precision.

Conclusion: QTGNN provides a scalable, interpretable, and effective solution for fraud detection, merging quantum machine learning, graph theory, and topological analysis.

Abstract: We propose a novel QTGNN framework for detecting fraudulent transactions in large-scale financial networks. By integrating quantum embedding, variational graph convolutions, and topological data analysis, QTGNN captures complex transaction dynamics and structural anomalies indicative of fraud. The methodology includes quantum data embedding with entanglement enhancement, variational quantum graph convolutions with non-linear dynamics, extraction of higher-order topological invariants, hybrid quantum-classical anomaly learning with adaptive optimization, and interpretable decision-making via topological attribution. Rigorous convergence guarantees ensure stable training on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, while stability of topological signatures provides robust fraud detection. Optimized for NISQ hardware with circuit simplifications and graph sampling, the framework scales to large transaction networks. Simulations on financial datasets, such as PaySim and Elliptic, benchmark QTGNN against classical and quantum baselines, using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, and false positive rate. An ablation study evaluates the contributions of quantum embeddings, topological features, non-linear channels, and hybrid learning. QTGNN offers a theoretically sound, interpretable, and practical solution for financial fraud detection, bridging quantum machine learning, graph theory, and topological analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method detects hidden structural damage in urban transport systems post-extreme weather, unlike traditional recovery metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surface-level recovery assessments miss permanent structural damage, leading to false recovery conclusions.

Method: The paper introduces a physics-constrained Hamiltonian learning algorithm combining structural irreversibility detection and energy landscape reconstruction.

Result: Applied to London's 2021 extreme rainfall, the method identified 64.8% structural damage overlooked by traditional metrics.

Conclusion: The framework offers proactive risk assessment tools for infrastructure investments, ensuring decisions reflect true system health.

Abstract: Urban transportation systems face increasing resilience challenges from extreme weather events, but current assessment methods rely on surface-level recovery indicators that miss hidden structural damage. Existing approaches cannot distinguish between true recovery and "false recovery," where traffic metrics normalize, but the underlying system dynamics permanently degrade. To address this, a new physics-constrained Hamiltonian learning algorithm combining "structural irreversibility detection" and "energy landscape reconstruction" has been developed. Our approach extracts low-dimensional state representations, identifies quasi-Hamiltonian structures through physics-constrained optimization, and quantifies structural changes via energy landscape comparison. Analysis of London's extreme rainfall in 2021 demonstrates that while surface indicators were fully recovered, our algorithm detected 64.8\% structural damage missed by traditional monitoring. Our framework provides tools for proactive structural risk assessment, enabling infrastructure investments based on true system health rather than misleading surface metrics.

*Sathya Edamadaka,Soojung Yang,Ju Li,Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether diverse machine learning models converge to similar internal representations of matter, revealing alignment across modalities but limitations in generalization beyond training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand if scientific models learn universal representations of matter, which is crucial for developing reliable foundation models in science.

Method: The authors analyze representations from nearly sixty models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, across various chemical systems.

Result: Models align closely on familiar inputs but collapse on unseen structures, revealing limitations in generalization and inductive bias.

Conclusion: Representational alignment serves as a benchmark for model generality, aiding in the selection of models with the most transferable representations.

Abstract: Machine learning models of vastly different modalities and architectures are being trained to predict the behavior of molecules, materials, and proteins. However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure. Our findings establish representational alignment as a quantitative benchmark for foundation-level generality in scientific models. More broadly, our work can track the emergence of universal representations of matter as models scale, and for selecting and distilling models whose learned representations transfer best across modalities, domains of matter, and scientific tasks.

*Stephen Law,Tao Yang,Nanjiang Chen,Xuhui Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conditional trajectory encoder to jointly learn spatial and temporal representations of urban navigation, addressing gaps in current AI-driven trajectory analysis by integrating spatial context, temporal dynamics, and origin-dependent asymmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for urban trajectory analysis are fragmented, overlooking the integration of spatial and temporal dynamics, directional asymmetries, and fundamental geometric properties of urban space. The paper aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: The proposed conditional trajectory encoder uses a bidirectional LSTM to process visibility ratio and curvature features, conditioned on learnable origin embeddings. It employs contrastive learning to decompose representations into shared urban patterns and origin-specific signatures.

Result: The framework successfully measures cognitive asymmetries across starting locations, validated on synthetic cities and Beijing's Xicheng District. It reveals systematic cognitive inequalities influenced by urban morphology.

Conclusion: The approach provides planners with tools for assessing experiential equity, offers architects insights into layout impacts, and enables origin-aware analytics for navigation systems.

Abstract: Urban analytics increasingly relies on AI-driven trajectory analysis, yet current approaches suffer from methodological fragmentation: trajectory learning captures movement patterns but ignores spatial context, while spatial embedding methods encode street networks but miss temporal dynamics. Three gaps persist: (1) lack of joint training that integrates spatial and temporal representations, (2) origin-agnostic treatment that ignores directional asymmetries in navigation ($A \to B \ne B \to A$), and (3) over-reliance on auxiliary data (POIs, imagery) rather than fundamental geometric properties of urban space. We introduce a conditional trajectory encoder that jointly learns spatial and movement representations while preserving origin-dependent asymmetries using geometric features. This framework decomposes urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives, enabling quantitative measurement of cognitive asymmetries across starting locations. Our bidirectional LSTM processes visibility ratio and curvature features conditioned on learnable origin embeddings, decomposing representations into shared urban patterns and origin-specific signatures through contrastive learning. Results from six synthetic cities and real-world validation on Beijing's Xicheng District demonstrate that urban morphology creates systematic cognitive inequalities. This provides urban planners quantitative tools for assessing experiential equity, offers architects insights into layout decisions' cognitive impacts, and enables origin-aware analytics for navigation systems.

TL;DR: Deep unfolding bridges classical optimization and ML by transforming iterative algorithms into trainable ML models. This tutorial overviews methodologies, theoretical guarantees, and practical trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical optimization (interpretability but high latency and tuning) and ML (powerful but lacks structure), deep unfolding combines both paradigms.

Method: Deep unfolding transforms iterative optimization algorithms into structured ML models, reviewing four design paradigms and training schemes.

Result: Recent theoretical advances provide convergence and generalization guarantees, with empirical studies highlighting trade-offs in complexity, interpretability, and robustness.

Conclusion: Deep unfolding offers a promising approach to leverage ML's capabilities while retaining optimization's structure and efficiency.

Abstract: Optimization methods play a central role in signal processing, serving as the mathematical foundation for inference, estimation, and control. While classical iterative optimization algorithms provide interpretability and theoretical guarantees, they often rely on surrogate objectives, require careful hyperparameter tuning, and exhibit substantial computational latency. Conversely, machine learning (ML ) offers powerful data-driven modeling capabilities but lacks the structure, transparency, and efficiency needed for optimization-driven inference. Deep unfolding has recently emerged as a compelling framework that bridges these two paradigms by systematically transforming iterative optimization algorithms into structured, trainable ML architectures. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of deep unfolding, presenting a unified perspective of methodologies for converting optimization solvers into ML models and highlighting their conceptual, theoretical, and practical implications. We review the foundations of optimization for inference and for learning, introduce four representative design paradigms for deep unfolding, and discuss the distinctive training schemes that arise from their iterative nature. Furthermore, we survey recent theoretical advances that establish convergence and generalization guarantees for unfolded optimizers, and provide comparative qualitative and empirical studies illustrating their relative trade-offs in complexity, interpretability, and robustness.

TL;DR: A machine learning approach translates smartphone sensor data into likelihood ratios for physical activities, validated on a new dataset (NFI_FARED), achieving high accuracy in distinguishing activity pairs and aiding forensic investigations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage smartphone and smartwatch sensor data for forensic insights into users' physical activities.

Method: Machine learning-based translation of digital traces (from movement sensors) into likelihood ratios (LRs) for various physical activities, evaluated on the NFI_FARED dataset.

Result: The approach distinguished 167 out of 171 activity pairings and was extended to analyze multiple activities or groups, creating activity timelines for forensic use.

Conclusion: The method effectively uses sensor data for forensic activity analysis, with public dataset and code promoting further research.

Abstract: Smartphones and smartwatches are ever-present in daily life, and provide a rich source of information on their users' behaviour. In particular, digital traces derived from the phone's embedded movement sensors present an opportunity for a forensic investigator to gain insight into a person's physical activities. In this work, we present a machine learning-based approach to translate digital traces into likelihood ratios (LRs) for different types of physical activities. Evaluating on a new dataset, NFI\_FARED, which contains digital traces from four different types of iPhones labelled with 19 activities, it was found that our approach could produce useful LR systems to distinguish 167 out of a possible 171 activity pairings. The same approach was extended to analyse likelihoods for multiple activities (or groups of activities) simultaneously and create activity timelines to aid in both the early and latter stages of forensic investigations. The dataset and all code required to replicate the results have also been made public to encourage further research on this topic.

*Francesco Vitale,Nicola Mazzocca*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-phase process mining method to automate and refine clinical pathways, improving accuracy and simplicity by leveraging historical and new patient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual modeling of clinical pathways is challenging and may not reflect best practices for varied disease combinations. Automating this process can enhance treatment standardization and efficiency.

Method: A two-phase approach: 1) Collect historical treatment data to create a reference process model. 2) Use conformance checking to compare new data against the model and expand the knowledge base with tailored models.

Result: The method achieves 95.62% AUC precision and maintains simplicity (67.11% arc-degree). Demonstrated using Synthea dataset for COVID-19 complications.

Conclusion: The approach effectively automates clinical pathway modeling, improving precision and adaptability for diverse disease scenarios.

Abstract: Clinical pathways are specialized healthcare plans that model patient treatment procedures. They are developed to provide criteria-based progression and standardize patient treatment, thereby improving care, reducing resource use, and accelerating patient recovery. However, manual modeling of these pathways based on clinical guidelines and domain expertise is difficult and may not reflect the actual best practices for different variations or combinations of diseases. We propose a two-phase modeling method using process mining, which extends the knowledge base of clinical pathways by leveraging conformance checking diagnostics. In the first phase, historical data of a given disease is collected to capture treatment in the form of a process model. In the second phase, new data is compared against the reference model to verify conformance. Based on the conformance checking results, the knowledge base can be expanded with more specific models tailored to new variants or disease combinations. We demonstrate our approach using Synthea, a benchmark dataset simulating patient treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections with varying COVID-19 complications. The results show that our method enables expanding the knowledge base of clinical pathways with sufficient precision, peaking to 95.62% AUC while maintaining an arc-degree simplicity of 67.11%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVPO is a new RL framework combining conditional risk theory and distributional value modeling to balance robustness and generalization in noisy supervision settings, outperforming existing methods like PPO and GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for LLM post-training often lack balance between robustness and generalization, leading to conservative or unstable policies under noisy supervision.

Method: DVPO uses token-level value distributions and asymmetric risk regularization to manage noise (contracting lower tail) and preserve exploration (expanding upper tail).

Result: DVPO outperforms PPO, GRPO, and robust Bellman-based PPO in multi-turn dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific QA tasks under noisy supervision.

Conclusion: DVPO offers a promising solution for LLM post-training in noisy real-world scenarios by effectively balancing robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong performance in LLM post-training, but real-world deployment often involves noisy or incomplete supervision. In such settings, complex and unreliable supervision signals can destabilize training and harm generalization. While existing approaches such as worst-case optimization (e.g., RFQI, CQL) and mean-based methods (e.g., PPO, GRPO) can improve stability, they often overlook generalization and may produce overly conservative policies, leading to uneven performance across diverse real scenarios. To this end, we introduce DVPO (Distributional Value Modeling with Risk-aware Policy Optimization), a new RL framework that combines conditional risk theory with distributional value modeling to better balance robustness and generalization. DVPO learns token-level value distributions to provide fine-grained supervision, and applies an asymmetric risk regularization to shape the distribution tails: it contracts the lower tail to dampen noisy negative deviations, while expanding the upper tail to preserve exploratory diversity. Across extensive experiments and analysis in multi-turn dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific QA, DVPO consistently outperforms PPO, GRPO, and robust Bellman-based PPO under noisy supervision, showing its potential for LLM post-training in the real-world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG signals are valuable for detecting heart abnormalities but face challenges like high misdiagnosis rates and heavy medical workloads. The study aims to reduce these burdens using advanced deep learning.

Method: The authors propose EfficientECG, a lightweight model based on EfficientNet, optimized for high-frequency ECG data. They further enhance it with a cross-attention feature fusion model for multi-lead and multi-feature analysis.

Result: Evaluations on ECG datasets demonstrate superior performance in precision, multi-feature fusion, and computational efficiency compared to existing models.

Conclusion: The novel deep learning approaches effectively improve ECG diagnosis accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical solution for medical applications.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram is a useful diagnostic signal that can detect cardiac abnormalities by measuring the electrical activity generated by the heart. Due to its rapid, non-invasive, and richly informative characteristics, ECG has many emerging applications. In this paper, we study novel deep learning technologies to effectively manage and analyse ECG data, with the aim of building a diagnostic model, accurately and quickly, that can substantially reduce the burden on medical workers. Unlike the existing ECG models that exhibit a high misdiagnosis rate, our deep learning approaches can automatically extract the features of ECG data through end-to-end training. Specifically, we first devise EfficientECG, an accurate and lightweight classification model for ECG analysis based on the existing EfficientNet model, which can effectively handle high-frequency long-sequence ECG data with various leading types. On top of that, we next propose a cross-attention-based feature fusion model of EfficientECG for analysing multi-lead ECG data with multiple features (e.g., gender and age). Our evaluations on representative ECG datasets validate the superiority of our model against state-of-the-art works in terms of high precision, multi-feature fusion, and lightweights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates deep-RL algorithms (DDQN and PPO) for Dynamic Algorithm Configuration (DAC), uncovering scalability and instability issues caused by under-exploration and planning horizon coverage. Solutions include adaptive reward shifting for DDQN and undiscounted learning, with DDQN outperforming prior methods.

Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiencies and domain expertise required in applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to DAC, specifically focusing on controlling the population size parameter of the (1+(λ,λ))-GA on OneMax instances.

Method: The authors analyze DDQN and PPO in DAC, identifying challenges like scalability degradation and learning instability. They propose adaptive reward shifting for under-exploration in DDQN and undiscounted learning for planning horizon coverage.

Result: DDQN with adaptive reward shifting achieves performance comparable to theoretical policies, significantly outperforming prior DAC methods in sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Targeted solutions like adaptive reward shifting and undiscounted learning effectively address DAC challenges in DDQN, while PPO struggles with inherent issues, highlighting DDQN's superiority in this context.

Abstract: Dynamic Algorithm Configuration (DAC) studies the efficient identification of control policies for parameterized optimization algorithms. Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges in algorithm configuration. However, applying RL to DAC is challenging and often requires extensive domain expertise. We conduct a comprehensive study of deep-RL algorithms in DAC through a systematic analysis of controlling the population size parameter of the (1+($λ$,$λ$))-GA on OneMax instances. Our investigation of DDQN and PPO reveals two fundamental challenges that limit their effectiveness in DAC: scalability degradation and learning instability. We trace these issues to two primary causes: under-exploration and planning horizon coverage, each of which can be effectively addressed through targeted solutions. To address under-exploration, we introduce an adaptive reward shifting mechanism that leverages reward distribution statistics to enhance DDQN agent exploration, eliminating the need for instance-specific hyperparameter tuning and ensuring consistent effectiveness across different problem scales. In dealing with the planning horizon coverage problem, we demonstrate that undiscounted learning effectively resolves it in DDQN, while PPO faces fundamental variance issues that necessitate alternative algorithmic designs. We further analyze the hyperparameter dependencies of PPO, showing that while hyperparameter optimization enhances learning stability, it consistently falls short in identifying effective policies across various configurations. Finally, we demonstrate that DDQN equipped with our adaptive reward shifting strategy achieves performance comparable to theoretically derived policies with vastly improved sample efficiency, outperforming prior DAC approaches by several orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: An acceleration method using unbiased surrogate estimators for Decision Focused Learning improves scalability without compromising solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional estimators for uncertain parameters in optimization problems lead to suboptimal solutions. Decision Focused Learning addresses this but lacks scalability.

Method: Proposes an acceleration method using unbiased surrogate estimators to replace costly loss function evaluations, designed for black-box settings.

Result: Reduces inner solver calls significantly while maintaining solution quality comparable to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances scalability and solution quality in Decision Focused Learning.

Abstract: Decision support systems often rely on solving complex optimization problems that may require to estimate uncertain parameters beforehand. Recent studies have shown how using traditionally trained estimators for this task can lead to suboptimal solutions. Using the actual decision cost as a loss function (called Decision Focused Learning) can address this issue, but with a severe loss of scalability at training time. To address this issue, we propose an acceleration method based on replacing costly loss function evaluations with an efficient surrogate. Unlike previously defined surrogates, our approach relies on unbiased estimators reducing the risk of spurious local optima and can provide information on its local confidence allowing one to switch to a fallback method when needed. Furthermore, the surrogate is designed for a black-box setting, which enables compensating for simplifications in the optimization model and account- ing for recourse actions during cost computation. In our results, the method reduces costly inner solver calls, with a solution quality comparable to other state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-effective method for continuous monitoring of LLM APIs using logprob statistics, detecting small changes like fine-tuning steps with minimal cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users need consistent LLM APIs for reliability and reproducibility, but existing audit methods are too expensive for regular use. The paper aims to provide a low-cost solution.

Method: A simple statistical test based on average token logprob values, requiring only a single token output, is developed to detect model changes.

Result: The method detects changes as small as one fine-tuning step, is more sensitive than existing methods, and costs 1,000x less.

Conclusion: The proposed logprob-based approach offers a practical, cost-effective solution for monitoring LLM API consistency, supported by the TinyChange benchmark.

Abstract: When using an LLM through an API provider, users expect the served model to remain consistent over time, a property crucial for the reliability of downstream applications and the reproducibility of research. Existing audit methods are too costly to apply at regular time intervals to the wide range of available LLM APIs. This means that model updates are left largely unmonitored in practice. In this work, we show that while LLM log probabilities (logprobs) are usually non-deterministic, they can still be used as the basis for cost-effective continuous monitoring of LLM APIs. We apply a simple statistical test based on the average value of each token logprob, requesting only a single token of output. This is enough to detect changes as small as one step of fine-tuning, making this approach more sensitive than existing methods while being 1,000x cheaper. We introduce the TinyChange benchmark as a way to measure the sensitivity of audit methods in the context of small, realistic model changes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GFP is an offline RL method that uses a guided flow policy and distilled actor to prioritize high-value actions, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline RL methods fail to distinguish high-value actions, leading to suboptimal performance. GFP aims to improve this by focusing on high-value actions.

Method: GFP combines a multi-step flow-matching policy with a distilled one-step actor, using weighted behavior cloning to prioritize high-value actions.

Result: GFP achieves state-of-the-art performance across 144 tasks in OGBench, Minari, and D4RL benchmarks, especially on suboptimal datasets.

Conclusion: GFP's mutual guidance between flow policy and actor effectively prioritizes high-value actions, enhancing offline RL performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning often relies on behavior regularization that enforces policies to remain close to the dataset distribution. However, such approaches fail to distinguish between high-value and low-value actions in their regularization components. We introduce Guided Flow Policy (GFP), which couples a multi-step flow-matching policy with a distilled one-step actor. The actor directs the flow policy through weighted behavior cloning to focus on cloning high-value actions from the dataset rather than indiscriminately imitating all state-action pairs. In turn, the flow policy constrains the actor to remain aligned with the dataset's best transitions while maximizing the critic. This mutual guidance enables GFP to achieve state-of-the-art performance across 144 state and pixel-based tasks from the OGBench, Minari, and D4RL benchmarks, with substantial gains on suboptimal datasets and challenging tasks.

*Janis Keck,Lukas Silvester Barth,Fatemeh,Fahimi,Parvaneh Joharinad,Jürgen Jost*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a probabilistic interpretation of fuzzy simplicial sets, linking them to UMAP and enabling new dimensionality reduction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a clear probabilistic interpretation for fuzzy simplicial sets detaches them from common theoretical frameworks in dimensionality reduction and manifold learning.

Method: The authors introduce a framework explaining fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets, connecting them to generative models and probabilistic operations.

Result: The framework clarifies UMAP's fuzzy weights, connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models, and enables derivation of new embedding methods.

Conclusion: The probabilistic viewpoint unifies fuzzy simplicial sets, explains UMAP's role, and opens doors for systematic development of new dimensionality reduction techniques.

Abstract: Fuzzy simplicial sets have become an object of interest in dimensionality reduction and manifold learning, most prominently through their role in UMAP. However, their definition through tools from algebraic topology without a clear probabilistic interpretation detaches them from commonly used theoretical frameworks in those areas. In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using Čech filtrations with triplet sampling. In summary, this probabilistic viewpoint provides a unified probabilistic theoretical foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, clarifies the role of UMAP within this framework, and enables the systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods.

*Xiang Rao,Yina Liu,Yuxuan Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) to solve reservoir seepage PDEs, addressing limitations of traditional methods and classical PINNs. It combines quantum circuits with classical networks for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome mesh-dependent errors, high computational costs, and inefficiencies in classical methods and PINNs for solving reservoir seepage PDEs.

Method: QCPINN integrates classical networks with a Discrete Variable (DV) quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement. It tests three quantum circuit topologies.

Result: QCPINNs achieve higher accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Alternate topology excels in heterogeneous single-phase and two-phase flows; Cascade performs best in compositional flow.

Conclusion: QCPINN effectively bridges quantum computing and oil/gas engineering, demonstrating feasibility for reservoir applications.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) for reservoir seepage is critical for optimizing oil and gas field development and predicting production performance. Traditional numerical methods suffer from mesh-dependent errors and high computational costs, while classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face bottlenecks in parameter efficiency, high-dimensional expression, and strong nonlinear fitting. To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption. The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling. Our work verifies the feasibility of QCPINN for reservoir engineering applications, bridging the gap between quantum computing research and industrial practice in oil and gas engineering.

*Michele Alessi,Alessio Ansuini,Alex Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiVAE is a lightweight regularizer for VAEs that aligns latent log-prior probabilities with data-space density, improving alignment, prior coverage, and OOD uncertainty calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VAEs ignore data-space density structure, leading to suboptimal latent representations. DiVAE addresses this by aligning the latent log-prior with estimated data-space density.

Method: DiVAE introduces a robust, precision-weighted penalty to the ELBO, ensuring posterior mass aligns with data-space density and nudging learnable priors toward high-density regions with minimal computational overhead.

Result: DiVAE improves latent distribution alignment, prior coverage, and OOD uncertainty calibration on synthetic datasets. On MNIST, it enhances prior interpretability and OOD detection for learnable priors.

Conclusion: DiVAE effectively bridges the gap between latent priors and data-space density, offering improved performance and interpretability in VAE frameworks.

Abstract: We introduce Density-Informed VAE (DiVAE), a lightweight, data-driven regularizer that aligns the VAE log-prior probability $\log p_Z(z)$ with a log-density estimated from data. Standard VAEs match latents to a simple prior, overlooking density structure in the data-space. DiVAE encourages the encoder to allocate posterior mass in proportion to data-space density and, when the prior is learnable, nudges the prior toward high-density regions. This is realized by adding a robust, precision-weighted penalty to the ELBO, incurring negligible computational overhead. On synthetic datasets, DiVAE (i) improves distributional alignment of latent log-densities to its ground truth counterpart, (ii) improves prior coverage, and (iii) yields better OOD uncertainty calibration. On MNIST, DiVAE improves alignment of the prior with external estimates of the density, providing better interpretability, and improves OOD detection for learnable priors.

TL;DR: The paper reviews text dataset distillation, detailing its evolution from vision-based methods to transformer models, challenges like benchmarking standardization, and future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To summarize advancements in text dataset distillation, addressing gaps like benchmarking and handling complex tasks.

Method: Reviews past and recent methods, including transformer-based approaches and synthetic text generation.

Result: Highlights key milestones but identifies remaining challenges in standardization and real-world applications.

Conclusion: Text dataset distillation is evolving but needs further standardization and practical application examples.

Abstract: In the vision domain, dataset distillation arises as a technique to condense a large dataset into a smaller synthetic one that exhibits a similar result in the training process. While image data presents an extensive literature of distillation methods, text dataset distillation has fewer works in comparison. Text dataset distillation initially grew as an adaptation of efforts from the vision universe, as the particularities of the modality became clear obstacles, it rose into a separate branch of research. Several milestones mark the development of this area, such as the introduction of methods that use transformer models, the generation of discrete synthetic text, and the scaling to decoder-only models with over 1B parameters. Despite major advances in modern approaches, the field remains in a maturing phase, with room for improvement on benchmarking standardization, approaches to overcome the discrete nature of text, handling complex tasks, and providing explicit examples of real-world applications. In this report, we review past and recent advances in dataset distillation for text, highlighting different distillation strategies, key contributions, and general challenges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free method using whitening techniques detects policy violations in LLMs efficiently and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations need reliable policy violation detection for LLMs in sensitive domains to mitigate legal and reputational risks.

Method: Treats policy violation detection as OOD detection, applying whitening to decorrelate hidden activations and using Euclidean norm for scoring.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on policy benchmarks, surpassing guardrails and fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: Provides a lightweight, deployable framework for policy-aware LLM oversight, advancing AI governance.

Abstract: Aligning proprietary large language models (LLMs) with internal organizational policies has become an urgent priority as organizations increasingly deploy LLMs in sensitive domains such as legal support, finance, and medical services. Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.

### [257] [MarkTune: Improving the Quality-Detectability Trade-off in Open-Weight LLM Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04044)
*Yizhou Zhao,Zhiwei Steven Wu,Adam Block*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MarkTune improves the quality-detectability trade-off for watermarking open-weight language models compared to GaussMark by using on-policy fine-tuning, preserving text quality while enhancing robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-weight language models struggle with watermarking due to inference-time interventions not being enforceable post-publication. Existing methods like GaussMark degrade generation quality for detectable signals.

Method: MarkTune employs theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning, treating GaussMark signals as rewards while regularizing against quality loss.

Result: MarkTune outperforms GaussMark in quality-detectability trade-off, resists attacks, and generalizes well to unseen datasets.

Conclusion: MarkTune is a robust, high-quality watermarking strategy for open-weight LMs, bridging the gap to inference-time watermarks.

Abstract: Watermarking aims to embed hidden signals in generated text that can be reliably detected when given access to a secret key. Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets. Together, these results establish MarkTune as a general strategy for embedding robust, high-quality watermarks into open-weight LMs.

### [258] [Physics-Embedded Gaussian Process for Traffic State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04004)
*Yanlin Chen,Kehua Chen,Yinhai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Physics-Embedded Gaussian Process (PEGP) integrates traffic flow models with data-driven methods for improved traffic state estimation under sparse observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in TSE due to low probe-vehicle penetration and sparse data, PEGP combines physical models' structure with data-driven methods for better generalization and uncertainty calibration.

Method: PEGP designs multi-output kernels based on traffic flow models, using linearized differential operators to embed physics into Gaussian processes.

Result: Experiments show PEGP outperforms non-physics baselines, with PEGP-ARZ excelling under sparse observations and PEGP-LWR achieving lower errors with denser data.

Conclusion: PEGP effectively integrates physical priors and uncertainty quantification, offering reliable TSE support while addressing model mis-specification and penalty tuning issues.

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) becomes challenging when probe-vehicle penetration is low and observations are spatially sparse. Pure data-driven methods lack physical explanations and have poor generalization when observed data is sparse. In contrast, physical models have difficulty integrating uncertainties and capturing the real complexity of traffic. To bridge this gap, recent studies have explored combining them by embedding physical structure into Gaussian process. These approaches typically introduce the governing equations as soft constraints through pseudo-observations, enabling the integration of model structure within a variational framework. However, these methods rely heavily on penalty tuning and lack principled uncertainty calibration, which makes them sensitive to model mis-specification. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a novel Physics-Embedded Gaussian Process (PEGP), designed to integrate domain knowledge with data-driven methods in traffic state estimation. Specifically, we design two multi-output kernels informed by classic traffic flow models, constructed via the explicit application of the linearized differential operator. Experiments on HighD, NGSIM show consistent improvements over non-physics baselines. PEGP-ARZ proves more reliable under sparse observation, while PEGP-LWR achieves lower errors with denser observation. Ablation study further reveals that PEGP-ARZ residuals align closely with physics and yield calibrated, interpretable uncertainty, whereas PEGP-LWR residuals are more orthogonal and produce nearly constant variance fields. This PEGP framework combines physical priors, uncertainty quantification, which can provide reliable support for TSE.

*Connall Garrod,Jonathan P. Keating,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes cross-entropy (CE) training dynamics in non-convex settings, focusing on a two-layer linear neural network to uncover implicit bias and neural collapse geometry, aided by a novel Hadamard Initialization technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theory on CE loss relies on simplifications (e.g., squared loss or convex models) that fail to capture its true dynamics, prompting a deeper exploration of non-convex optimization behavior.

Method: The study examines a canonical two-layer linear neural network with standard-basis inputs, constructing a Lyapunov function to prove global convergence and introducing Hadamard Initialization to simplify analysis.

Result: Gradient flow on CE is proven to converge to neural collapse geometry, overcoming spurious critical points in the non-convex landscape. Hadamard Initialization freezes singular vectors, simplifying dynamics.

Conclusion: The work provides foundational insights into CE optimization dynamics, demonstrating neural collapse convergence and introducing a technique for broader analysis of CE training.

Abstract: Cross-entropy (CE) training loss dominates deep learning practice, yet existing theory often relies on simplifications, either replacing it with squared loss or restricting to convex models, that miss essential behavior. CE and squared loss generate fundamentally different dynamics, and convex linear models cannot capture the complexities of non-convex optimization. We provide an in-depth characterization of multi-class CE optimization dynamics beyond the convex regime by analyzing a canonical two-layer linear neural network with standard-basis vectors as inputs: the simplest non-convex extension for which the implicit bias remained unknown. This model coincides with the unconstrained features model used to study neural collapse, making our work the first to prove that gradient flow on CE converges to the neural collapse geometry. We construct an explicit Lyapunov function that establishes global convergence, despite the presence of spurious critical points in the non-convex landscape. A key insight underlying our analysis is an inconspicuous finding: Hadamard Initialization diagonalizes the softmax operator, freezing the singular vectors of the weight matrices and reducing the dynamics entirely to their singular values. This technique opens a pathway for analyzing CE training dynamics well beyond our specific setting considered here.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a DP-SCO algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility trade-offs, whose DP verification is computationally cheaper than training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for verifying DP guarantees require computational resources comparable to training the model, making verification inefficient for data providers and the public.

Method: The authors design a DP algorithm for stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO) that privately minimizes a series of regularized objectives, leveraging standard DP composition bounds.

Result: The proposed method achieves tight privacy-utility trade-offs while enabling verification with significantly less computational effort than training.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical solution for efficient DP verification, reducing costs for large datasets and maintaining near optimal privacy-utility trade-offs.

Abstract: Training with differential privacy (DP) provides a guarantee to members in a dataset that they cannot be identified by users of the released model. However, those data providers, and, in general, the public, lack methods to efficiently verify that models trained on their data satisfy DP guarantees. The amount of compute needed to verify DP guarantees for current algorithms scales with the amount of compute required to train the model. In this paper we design the first DP algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility trade-offs but whose DP guarantees can be verified cheaper than training. We focus on DP stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO), where optimal privacy-utility trade-offs are known. Here we show we can obtain tight privacy-utility trade-offs by privately minimizing a series of regularized objectives and only using the standard DP composition bound. Crucially, this method can be verified with much less compute than training. This leads to the first known DP-SCO algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility whose DP verification scales better than training cost, significantly reducing verification costs on large datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains why OOD detection fails with single-domain datasets using information theory, showing domain feature collapse. Their solution, domain filtering, validates the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the catastrophic failure of OOD detection methods when models are trained on single-domain datasets.

Method: Theoretical analysis via information theory and Fano's inequality, validated using Domain Bench and domain filtering.

Result: Shows domain feature collapse causes OOD failure; domain filtering preserves domain features and resolves the issue.

Conclusion: Supervised learning on single domains discards domain features, limiting OOD detection, but domain filtering can mitigate this.

Abstract: Why do state-of-the-art OOD detection methods exhibit catastrophic failure when models are trained on single-domain datasets? We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework. Our work explains a puzzling empirical phenomenon, reveals fundamental limitations of supervised learning in narrow domains, and has broader implications for transfer learning and when to fine-tune versus freeze pretrained models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a discrete update rule for low-precision training of deep learning models, avoiding traditional quantisation methods, and demonstrates its effectiveness with empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce computational resources in deep learning by developing efficient low-precision training methods without relying on discretising continuous updates.

Method: The method introduces a discrete update rule, specifically a multinomial update rule, as an alternative to quantising real-valued updates. Convergence guarantees are provided for a general class of such schemes.

Result: Empirical evaluation supports the effectiveness of the proposed discrete update rule, showing its potential for efficient training.

Conclusion: The discrete update approach offers new opportunities for efficient training, especially for models with inherently discrete structures, and avoids the limitations of traditional quantisation.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models require immense computational resources, motivating research into low-precision training. Quantised training addresses this by representing training components in low-bit integers, but typically relies on discretising real-valued updates. We introduce an alternative approach where the update rule itself is discrete, avoiding the quantisation of continuous updates by design. We establish convergence guarantees for a general class of such discrete schemes, and present a multinomial update rule as a concrete example, supported by empirical evaluation. This perspective opens new avenues for efficient training, particularly for models with inherently discrete structure.

TL;DR: Eval Factsheets is a framework for systematically documenting AI evaluation methodologies to improve transparency and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of structured documentation standards for AI evaluation methodologies hinders reproducibility and informed decision-making.

Method: Introduces Eval Factsheets, a taxonomy and questionnaire-based framework covering five dimensions: Context, Scope, Structure, Method, and Alignment.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across diverse evaluation paradigms, ensuring consistency and comparability.

Conclusion: Encourages adoption of Eval Factsheets to enhance transparency and reproducibility in AI evaluations.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of benchmarks has created significant challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and informed decision-making. However, unlike datasets and models -- which benefit from structured documentation frameworks like Datasheets and Model Cards -- evaluation methodologies lack systematic documentation standards. We introduce Eval Factsheets, a structured, descriptive framework for documenting AI system evaluations through a comprehensive taxonomy and questionnaire-based approach. Our framework organizes evaluation characteristics across five fundamental dimensions: Context (Who made the evaluation and when?), Scope (What does it evaluate?), Structure (With what the evaluation is built?), Method (How does it work?) and Alignment (In what ways is it reliable/valid/robust?). We implement this taxonomy as a practical questionnaire spanning five sections with mandatory and recommended documentation elements. Through case studies on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Eval Factsheets effectively captures diverse evaluation paradigms -- from traditional benchmarks to LLM-as-judge methodologies -- while maintaining consistency and comparability. We hope Eval Factsheets are incorporated into both existing and newly released evaluation frameworks and lead to more transparency and reproducibility.

*Jonathan Berant,Maximillian Chen,Adam Fisch,Reza Aghajani,Fantine Huot,Mirella Lapata,Jacob Eisenstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes training steerable policies for AI assistants to manage ambiguity in user queries through self-play and cost-aware reinforcement learning, achieving adaptable and generalizable behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling ambiguous queries requires context-aware policies, considering factors like user preferences and modality (e.g., screen size or voice). Current methods lack adaptability to varying costs and contexts.

Method: The approach uses self-play with two agents (user and assistant) simulating ambiguous queries. Reinforcement learning (ReST) trains the assistant to maximize cost-penalized accuracy, considering clarification costs.

Result: The trained policy adapts predictably to cost inputs, improving reward and accuracy. It generalizes to unseen cost values during training.

Conclusion: Self-play and reinforcement learning enable adaptable policies for handling ambiguous queries, balancing accuracy and cost efficiency across contexts.

Abstract: To handle underspecified or ambiguous queries, AI assistants need a policy for managing their uncertainty to determine (a) when to guess the user intent and answer directly, (b) when to enumerate and answer multiple possible intents, and (c) when to ask a clarifying question. However, such policies are contextually dependent on factors such as user preferences or modality. For example, enumerating multiple possible user intentions is cumbersome on small screens or in a voice setting. In this work, we propose to train steerable policies for managing this uncertainty using self-play. Given two agents, one simulating a user and the other an AI assistant, we generate conversations where the user issues a potentially ambiguous query, and the assistant needs to determine how to respond. Importantly, the model takes as input the numerical cost of each clarification question, and each generated word, and is asked to take the action that will maximize its final reward, which is the cost-penalized accuracy. We use Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) to train our model to achieve high reward and show this leads to a steerable policy that changes its behavior predictably conditioned on the provided costs, leading to higher reward and accuracy. Moreover, our procedure also generalizes to numerical cost values that were unobserved at training time.
