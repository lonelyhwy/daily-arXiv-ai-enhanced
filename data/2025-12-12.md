### [1] [Neuromorphic Eye Tracking for Low-Latency Pupil Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09969)
*Paul Hueber,Luca Peres,Florian Pitters,Alejandro Gloriani,Oliver Rhodes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuromorphic approach using SNNs for efficient, high-performance eye-tracking in wearable systems, achieving low latency and power usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional eye-tracking methods suffer from motion blur, high compute costs, and limited resolution, which hinder seamless interaction in AR/VR applications. Neuromorphic sensors and SNNs offer potential but lack performance parity with ANNs.

Method: The paper redesigns top-performing event-based eye-tracking models with SNNs, replacing recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce complexity.

Result: The SNN models achieve 3.7-4.1px mean error (close to Retina's 3.24px), reduce model size by 20x, and cut theoretical compute by 850x vs. ANNs, with projected 3.9-4.9 mW power and 3 ms latency.

Conclusion: SNNs can be redesigned for wearable eye-tracking with significant efficiency gains and retained accuracy, enabling real-time deployment in AR/VR.

Abstract: Eye tracking for wearable systems demands low latency and milliwatt-level power, but conventional frame-based pipelines struggle with motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution. Such capabilities are vital for enabling seamless and responsive interaction in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where understanding user gaze is key to immersion and interface design. Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity. Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model. These efficient variants are projected to operate at an estimated 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz. The present results indicate that high-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains, while retaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment.

### [2] [ABBSPO: Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling and Symmetric Prior based Orientation Prediction for Detecting Aerial Image Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10031)
*Woojin Lee,Hyugjae Chang,Jaeho Moon,Jaehyup Lee,Munchurl Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABBSPO introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction for weakly supervised oriented object detection, improving accuracy and addressing limitations of previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inaccurate scale estimation and learning collapse in HBox-supervised OOD methods by leveraging adaptive scaling and symmetry priors.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS) and Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss for accurate scale prediction and self-supervised learning.

Result: ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing weakly supervised methods.

Conclusion: ABBSPO effectively addresses key challenges in weakly supervised OOD, offering a robust and accurate framework.

Abstract: Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

### [3] [Diffusion Is Your Friend in Show, Suggest and Tell](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10038)
*Jia Cheng Hu,Roberto Cavicchioli,Alessandro Capotondi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SST, a hybrid model combining diffusion denoising and autoregressive generation for improved captioning, achieving SOTA results on COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models underperform autoregressive models in discrete domains; SST seeks to combine their strengths for better performance.

Method: SST integrates diffusion models (for suggestions) with autoregressive generation (for linguistic structure) in a novel hybrid approach.

Result: SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on COCO, surpassing SOTA autoregressive and diffusion models by 1.5 and 2.5 points, respectively.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach shows promise, with suggestions positively impacting caption quality, indicating a promising research direction.

Abstract: Diffusion Denoising models demonstrated impressive results across generative Computer Vision tasks, but they still fail to outperform standard autoregressive solutions in the discrete domain, and only match them at best. In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points. On top of the strong results, we performed extensive experiments to validate the proposal and analyze the impact of the suggestion module. Results demonstrate a positive correlation between suggestion and caption quality, overall indicating a currently underexplored but promising research direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaVoxel is a joint diffusion modeling framework that unifies multiple medical AI tasks by learning a single diffusion process, enabling flexible zero-shot inference without task-specific retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods often focus on specific conditional distributions, requiring separate models for different tasks. MetaVoxel aims to unify these by modeling the joint distribution of imaging data and clinical metadata.

Method: MetaVoxel learns a single diffusion process spanning all variables (imaging and metadata), enabling joint modeling. It was tested on over 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans with clinical metadata.

Result: MetaVoxel achieves performance comparable to task-specific baselines in image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, while supporting flexible zero-shot inference.

Conclusion: Joint multimodal diffusion, as demonstrated by MetaVoxel, is a promising approach for unifying medical AI models and enhancing clinical applicability.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.

*Jiahao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to improve compositional generalization in Vision-Language models by learning word-image feature connections. Two IDE-based models are tested, showing better generalization than current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale Vision-Language models struggle with human-like compositional generalization despite success in tasks like image captioning and conditioned image generation.

Method: Proposes IDE to link individual words to image features. Two models are built: one uses fully disentangled visual representations, and the other uses a Variational Auto-Encoder for partially disentangled features. An entropy-based inference method combines word predictions.

Result: The IDE-based models demonstrate superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to existing models on various datasets.

Conclusion: IDE effectively addresses compositional generalization challenges in Vision-Language models, as evidenced by improved performance.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language models have achieved remarkable results in various domains, such as image captioning and conditioned image generation. Neverthe- less, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like composi- tional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connec- tion between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images. Additionally, we propose an entropy- based compositional inference method to combine predictions of each word in the sentence. Our models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models when evaluated on various datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in rendering dynamic specular scenes, such as accurate reflection direction estimation and physically correct reflections.

Method: Uses Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic geometry and materials, Dynamic Environment Gaussian, and a hybrid rendering pipeline combining rasterization and ray tracing.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on benchmarks, delivering sharper and more realistic specular reflections.

Conclusion: TraceFlow advances dynamic specular rendering with improved accuracy and realism.

Abstract: We present TraceFlow, a novel framework for high-fidelity rendering of dynamic specular scenes by addressing two key challenges: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling. To achieve this, we propose a Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting representation that models dynamic geometry and material properties, allowing accurate reflection ray computation. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Environment Gaussian and a hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse and specular components, enabling physically grounded specular synthesis via rasterization and ray tracing. Finally, we devise a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve optimization stability and promote physically meaningful decomposition. Extensive experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks demonstrate that TraceFlow outperforms prior methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing sharper and more realistic specular reflections in complex dynamic environments.

*Md Eimran Hossain Eimon,Juan Merlos,Ashan Perera,Hari Kalva,Velibor Adzic,Borko Furht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM) to compress intermediate features for edge-cloud DNN inference, achieving 85.14% bitrate reduction without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable efficient edge-cloud DNN deployment by addressing bandwidth challenges in transmitting intermediate features.

Method: Develops the FCTM under MPEG's FCM standard, focusing on compressing features for DNNs.

Result: Achieves an average 85.14% bitrate reduction across vision tasks.

Conclusion: FCM provides a scalable solution for bandwidth-limited, privacy-sensitive DNN applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) drive modern machine vision but are challenging to deploy on edge devices due to high compute demands. Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy. FCM offers a scalable path for efficient and interoperable deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive consumer applications.

### [9] [Latent Chain-of-Thought World Modeling for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10226)
*Shuhan Tan,Kashyap Chitta,Yuxiao Chen,Ran Tian,Yurong You,Yan Wang,Wenjie Luo,Yulong Cao,Philipp Krahenbuhl,Marco Pavone,Boris Ivanovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive) replaces text-based reasoning with latent language for autonomous driving, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve driving performance and safety by replacing inefficient text-based reasoning with latent language aligned with actions.

Method: Uses action-proposal and world model tokens in a latent space, supervised by future scene rollouts and post-trained with reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves faster inference, better trajectories, and greater reinforcement learning improvements compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Latent reasoning outperforms text-based methods in autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.

### [10] [Emerging Standards for Machine-to-Machine Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10230)
*Md Eimran Hossain Eimon,Velibor Adzic,Hari Kalva,Borko Furht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores machine-to-machine communication in visual data, comparing pixel-based (VCM) and feature-based (FCM) coding. FCM reduces bandwidth and preserves privacy while maintaining accuracy. H.265/HEVC and H.266/VVC perform similarly, but H.264/AVC is less efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine-to-machine systems rely on human-optimized codecs, which are bandwidth-heavy, scale poorly, and lack privacy. New approaches (VCM/FCM) aim to address these issues.

Method: The study evaluates VCM (task-aware pixel coding) and FCM (compressed neural features), testing their impact on accuracy and bitrate. Existing codecs (H.26X) are analyzed within FCM.

Result: FCM maintains accuracy close to edge inference while reducing bitrate. H.265/HEVC and H.266/VVC perform similarly, but H.264/AVC is significantly less efficient. Tracking tasks show minimal codec impact.

Conclusion: FCM is a viable alternative for machine-to-machine communication, offering privacy and bandwidth benefits. Existing codecs (HEVC) can be reused without performance loss.

Abstract: Machines are increasingly becoming the primary consumers of visual data, yet most deployments of machine-to-machine systems still rely on remote inference where pixel-based video is streamed using codecs optimized for human perception. Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.

### [11] [Multi-dimensional Preference Alignment by Conditioning Reward Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10237)
*Jiho Jang,Jinyoung Kim,Kyungjune Baek,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in standard DPO for aligning diffusion models due to scalar reward aggregation, proposing MCDPO for multi-reward optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard DPO method struggles with reward conflicts from aggregating diverse evaluation axes into a single scalar reward, leading to unlearning desirable features.

Method: MCDPO introduces a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective, conditions training on preference outcome vectors, and uses dimensional reward dropout for balanced optimization.

Result: Experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL show MCDPO outperforms benchmarks, enabling dynamic multi-axis control at inference.

Conclusion: MCDPO effectively resolves reward conflicts, improving alignment and control in diffusion models without extra training or reward models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback has emerged as a standard for aligning diffusion models. However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

### [12] [Solving Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning from an Auto-Annotation Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10244)
*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWIFT, a novel method for semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) that leverages open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve performance on auto-annotation tasks by addressing the 'flat' probability distributions problem with simple techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSFSL methods overlook open-source VLMs, while FSL has successfully used them. The goal is to enhance real-world auto-annotation by integrating these resources.

Method: Proposes SWIFT, which combines classifier initialization and temperature tuning to boost pseudo-label confidence and unlabeled data usage. It finetunes VLMs with labeled, unlabeled, and noisy pretraining data.

Result: SWIFT outperforms FSL and SSL methods by ~5 accuracy points on five benchmarks and rivals supervised learning. 

Conclusion: SWIFT effectively bridges the gap between SSFSL and open-source VLMs, achieving competitive performance with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) formulates real-world applications like ''auto-annotation'', as it aims to learn a model over a few labeled and abundant unlabeled examples to annotate the unlabeled ones. Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\sim$5 accuracy points. SWIFT even rivals supervised learning, which finetunes VLMs with the unlabeled data being labeled with ground truth!

*Zhuo Wang,Xiliang Liu,Ligang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustSora benchmark evaluates watermark robustness in AI-generated video detection, revealing partial dependency and performance variations across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the influence of digital watermarks on AI-generated video detection, as existing benchmarks overlook this critical factor.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 6,500 videos (A-C, A-S, G-W, G-DeW) and introduced two tasks: Task-I (watermark-removed AI videos) and Task-II (fake watermarks on authentic videos). Tested ten models (specialized detectors, transformers, MLLMs).

Result: Performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformers show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp).

Conclusion: Partial watermark dependency exists; watermark-aware training is needed. RobustSora advances robust AI-generated video detection research.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated video technologies poses challenges to information integrity. While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust AIGC detection research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THE-Pose is a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework using topological priors and hybrid graph fusion to overcome limitations of 3D-GC methods, achieving significant improvements on the REAL275 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D graph convolution methods lack robustness to intra-class variations and visual ambiguities due to their focus on local geometry and depth.

Method: THE-Pose integrates topological features from images with point-cloud features via hybrid graph fusion, combining 2D context and 3D structure.

Result: On REAL275, THE-Pose outperforms the 3D-GC baseline by 35.8% and previous state-of-the-art by 7.2%.

Conclusion: The framework enhances pose estimation robustness for complex objects and occlusions by leveraging topological consistency.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation requires both global context and local structure to ensure robustness against intra-class variations. However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure. These fused features ensure stability for unseen or complicated objects, even under significant occlusions. Extensive experiments on the REAL275 dataset show that THE-Pose achieves a 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of cardiac chambers in echocardiography is vital for clinical diagnosis but faces challenges like noise and dynamic heart motion. Existing methods balance long-range dependencies and computational efficiency poorly.

Method: GDKVM incorporates Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) for inter-frame correlations, Gated Delta Rule (GDR) for memory storage, and Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) for multi-scale feature integration.

Result: GDKVM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets in segmentation accuracy and robustness, ensuring real-time performance.

Conclusion: GDKVM effectively addresses echocardiography segmentation challenges, offering superior accuracy and efficiency, validated on mainstream datasets. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac chambers in echocardiography sequences is crucial for the quantitative analysis of cardiac function, aiding in clinical diagnosis and treatment. The imaging noise, artifacts, and the deformation and motion of the heart pose challenges to segmentation algorithms. While existing methods based on convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and space-time memory networks have improved segmentation accuracy, they often struggle with the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation. In this paper, we introduce GDKVM, a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation. The model employs Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) to effectively model inter-frame correlations, and introduces Gated Delta Rule (GDR) to efficiently store intermediate memory states. Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module is designed to integrate local and global features at multiple scales, enhancing robustness against boundary blurring and noise interference. We validated GDKVM on two mainstream echocardiography video datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that GDKVM outperforms existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, while ensuring real-time performance.

TL;DR: LLM-NCD is a multimodal framework combining visual-textual semantics and prototype clustering to improve Novel Class Discovery, outperforming existing methods by up to 25.3% accuracy and addressing long-tail distribution challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NCD methods rely on visual features but face issues like insufficient discriminability and long-tail data distribution. The goal is to enhance classification and discovery of unknown classes.

Method: LLM-NCD fuses visual-textual semantics and uses prototype-guided clustering. It models cluster centers and semantic prototypes via joint optimization and employs a dual-phase discovery mechanism.

Result: On CIFAR-100, LLM-NCD improves unknown class accuracy by up to 25.3% and uniquely handles long-tail distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-NCD framework significantly advances NCD by leveraging multimodal data and adaptive clustering, setting a new benchmark for resilience to long-tail distributions.

Abstract: Novel Class Discovery aims to utilise prior knowledge of known classes to classify and discover unknown classes from unlabelled data. Existing NCD methods for images primarily rely on visual features, which suffer from limitations such as insufficient feature discriminability and the long-tail distribution of data. We propose LLM-NCD, a multimodal framework that breaks this bottleneck by fusing visual-textual semantics and prototype guided clustering. Our key innovation lies in modelling cluster centres and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimising known class image and text features, and a dualphase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known or novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering. Experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset show that compared to the current methods, this method achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes. Notably, our method shows unique resilience to long tail distributions, a first in NCD literature.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAAD improves adversarial robustness transfer by focusing on adversarial transferability, outperforming prior methods without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial distillation methods fail to fully utilize state-of-the-art robust teachers, leading to robust saturation. This work identifies adversarial transferability as a key factor.

Method: Proposes Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples based on their adversarial transferability.

Result: SAAD consistently enhances AutoAttack robustness across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAAD effectively addresses robust saturation by prioritizing transferable adversarial examples, offering a computationally efficient solution.

Abstract: Adversarial distillation in the standard min-max adversarial training framework aims to transfer adversarial robustness from a large, robust teacher network to a compact student. However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HongsinLee/saad.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionEdit introduces a dataset for motion-centric image editing, addressing gaps in existing datasets. A new benchmark, MotionEdit-Bench, evaluates models, revealing challenges for state-of-the-art methods. The proposed MotionNFT framework improves motion editing quality without compromising general editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing datasets lack focus on realistic motion transformations, limiting advancements in motion-centric tasks. MotionEdit fills this gap by providing high-fidelity motion edits derived from videos, supporting applications like video synthesis and animation.

Method: MotionEdit-Bench evaluates models on motion-centric edits using generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. MotionNFT, a post-training framework, uses motion alignment rewards to guide models toward accurate motion transformations.

Result: Benchmark results show motion editing is challenging for existing models. MotionNFT improves motion fidelity and editing quality on tasks like FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit without losing general editing performance.

Conclusion: MotionEdit and MotionEdit-Bench advance motion-centric image editing. MotionNFT effectively addresses existing model limitations, enabling better motion transformations while maintaining general editing capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce MotionEdit, a novel dataset for motion-centric image editing-the task of modifying subject actions and interactions while preserving identity, structure, and physical plausibility. Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.
  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit show that MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity of both base models on the motion editing task without sacrificing general editing ability, demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Xiaoxue Wu,Xinyuan Chen,Yaohui Wang,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShotDirector integrates camera control and editing-pattern-aware prompting for film-like shot transitions in video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on visual consistency but lack intentional film-editing patterns, limiting narrative coherence.

Method: The framework uses a camera control module with 6-DoF poses and shot-aware masks for hierarchical prompts.

Result: ShotDirector achieves controllable shot transitions and is supported by the ShotWeaver40K dataset and new metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines precise camera control with high-level semantic guidance for film-like transitions.

Abstract: Shot transitions play a pivotal role in multi-shot video generation, as they determine the overall narrative expression and the directorial design of visual storytelling. However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability. Disentangled360 aims to address these limitations by differentiating isotropic and anisotropic contributions.

Method: Uses a Gaussian Splatting backbone with a dual-branch conditioning framework (for CT intensity and RGB scenes) and a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method for scale ambiguity and structural realism.

Result: Superior performance on Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets in SSIM and LPIPS metrics, with runtime suitable for interactive applications.

Conclusion: Disentangled360 enables mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation without scene-specific finetuning or costly simulations.

Abstract: We introduce Disentangled360, an innovative 3D-aware technology that integrates the advantages of direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° unique view synthesis for applications in medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction. In contrast to current techniques that either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across various contexts, our framework distinctly differentiates between isotropic and anisotropic contributions inside a Gaussian Splatting backbone. We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications. Disentangled360 facilitates mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation, eliminating the necessity for scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations.

TL;DR: Efficient-VLN reduces training overhead in multimodal large language models for Vision-Language Navigation by addressing token processing burdens and balancing exploration-efficiency trade-offs, achieving top performance with minimal GPU hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The substantial training overhead in MLLMs for VLN, caused by quadratic computational burdens and exploration-efficiency trade-offs, hinders practical development.

Method: Proposes Efficient-VLN with two memory mechanisms (progressive and learnable recursive) and a dynamic mixed policy to balance exploration and efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (64.2% SR on R2R-CE, 67.0% SR on RxR-CE) with only 282 H800 GPU hours.

Conclusion: Efficient-VLN effectively reduces training overhead while maintaining high performance, demonstrating practical viability.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Critically, our model consumes merely 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology, such as inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and region-shrinkage effects of CAM-based supervision, by leveraging vision-language alignment for better region discovery under weak supervision.

Method: Proposes a prototype-driven framework integrating CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning for text-based prototypes and combining them with image prototypes. Uses a multi-scale pyramid module to enhance spatial precision in ViT representations and improve localization quality.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark, demonstrating improved segmentation quality due to text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages textual semantics and visual prototype learning for WSSS in digital pathology, showing significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology seeks to reduce annotation cost by learning from image-level labels, yet it remains limited by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and the region-shrinkage effect of CAM-based supervision. We propose a simple and effective prototype-driven framework that leverages vision-language alignment to improve region discovery under weak supervision. Our method integrates CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning to generate text-based prototypes and combines them with learnable image prototypes, forming a dual-modal prototype bank that captures both semantic and appearance cues. To address oversmoothing in ViT representations, we incorporate a multi-scale pyramid module that enhances spatial precision and improves localization quality. Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and detailed analyses demonstrate the benefits of text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes. These results highlight the effectiveness of jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning for WSSS in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a prototype learning framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology, integrating vision-language models (CONCH) and segmentation backbones (SegFormer) to improve localization and semantic consistency without dense annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSSS methods in histopathology rely on classification backbones that often localize only discriminative regions and miss full tissue structures. Combining complementary strengths of vision-language models and modern segmentation backbones is challenging under weak supervision.

Method: The framework uses text-guided prototype initialization, structural distillation from SegFormer, and morphology-aware representations from CONCH to create spatially coherent and semantically discriminative prototypes.

Result: The approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets show it outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed prototype learning framework effectively leverages heterogeneous sources to achieve better WSSS performance in histopathology while remaining computationally efficient.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology relies heavily on classification backbones, yet these models often localize only the most discriminative regions and struggle to capture the full spatial extent of tissue structures. Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that our prototype learning framework outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in 3D human pose estimation like complex body geometry, self-occlusion, and the need for large-scale motion datasets.

Method: Uses spatio-temporal point cloud and pose feature encoders with an attention-based generative regressor. Introduces MVPose3D dataset.

Result: Outperforms baseline models, showing superior performance across datasets.

Conclusion: Point2Pose is effective for 3D human pose estimation.

Abstract: We propose a novel generative approach for 3D human pose estimation. 3D human pose estimation poses several key challenges due to the complex geometry of the human body, self-occluding joints, and the requirement for large-scale real-world motion datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce Point2Pose, a framework that effectively models the distribution of human poses conditioned on sequential point cloud and pose history. Specifically, we employ a spatio-temporal point cloud encoder and a pose feature encoder to extract joint-wise features, followed by an attention-based generative regressor. Additionally, we present a large-scale indoor dataset MVPose3D, which contains multiple modalities, including IMU data of non-trivial human motions, dense multi-view point clouds, and RGB images. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating its superior performance across various datasets.

*Chao Gong,Depeng Wang,Zhipeng Wei,Ya Guo,Huijia Zhu,Jingjing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingPixels introduces Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2) for adaptive token reduction in audio-visual streams, maintaining performance with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token reduction methods for video-only LLMs fail in audio-visual tasks due to lack of cross-modal synergy and static budgets per modality.

Method: CS2 co-attends to joint audio-visual tokens, dynamically allocating budgets. Sync-RoPE preserves temporal relationships.

Result: Achieves comparable performance with 5-20% of tokens, 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

Conclusion: EchoingPixels effectively addresses audio-visual token reduction, balancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) face prohibitive computational overhead from massive audio and video tokens. Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of the original tokens, with a 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

TL;DR: StainNet, a ViT-based foundation model for special stain images, addresses limitations of H&E-trained PFMs by self-distillation SSL on 1.4M patches from HISTAI, showing strong performance in liver malignancy and ROI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) focus on H&E-stained images, limiting their clinical use with special stains like immunohistochemistry.

Method: StainNet uses self-distillation SSL, trained on 1.4M patches from 20,231 WSIs in HISTAI. Evaluated on liver malignancy and public ROI datasets.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance in classification, few-ratio learning, and retrieval, outperforming larger PFMs.

Conclusion: StainNet effectively bridges the gap for special stain analysis, offering a robust tool for computational pathology.

Abstract: Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.

Motivation: The dense distribution and geometric properties of filaments make manual annotation laborious and time-consuming, creating a need for high-quality synthetic data to improve filament segmentation.

Method: The paper introduces a filament-aware structural loss and a conditional generative framework (Pix2Pix-based) to generate realistic filament images from binary masks.

Result: The proposed approach effectively generates synthetic filament images and outperforms models trained without synthetic data.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the shortage of annotated filament data, enhancing the performance of filament segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Thin and elongated filamentous structures, such as microtubules and actin filaments, often play important roles in biological systems. Segmenting these filaments in biological images is a fundamental step for quantitative analysis. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of filament segmentation. However, there is a big challenge in acquiring high quality pixel-level annotated dataset for filamentous structures, as the dense distribution and geometric properties of filaments making manual annotation extremely laborious and time-consuming. To address the data shortage problem, we propose a conditional generative framework based on the Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filaments in microscopy images from binary masks. We also propose a filament-aware structural loss to improve the structure similarity when generating synthetic images. Our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach and outperformed existing model trained without synthetic data.

TL;DR: HD-CLIP improves real-world image super-resolution by using hierarchical embeddings for semantics and degradation, enhancing diffusion models with better guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unknown and complex degradations in real-world images, lacking generalization due to assumptions about degradation severity and limitations of CLIP text encoders.

Method: HD-CLIP decomposes images into semantic and ordinal degradation embeddings, integrates into diffusion models via CFG, and introduces CFPG to guide restoration while suppressing artifacts.

Result: HD-CLIP enhances detail fidelity and perceptual realism across datasets without requiring retraining, serving as a plug-and-play module.

Conclusion: HD-CLIP effectively addresses real-world super-resolution challenges by combining hierarchical degradation modeling with diffusion guidance.

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) aims to recover high-quality images from low-quality inputs degraded by unknown and complex real-world factors. Real-world scenarios involve diverse and coupled degradations, making it necessary to provide diffusion models with richer and more informative guidance. However, existing methods often assume known degradation severity and rely on CLIP text encoders that cannot capture numerical severity, limiting their generalization ability. To address this, we propose \textbf{HD-CLIP} (\textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}egradation CLIP), which decomposes a low-quality image into a semantic embedding and an ordinal degradation embedding that captures ordered relationships and allows interpolation across unseen levels. Furthermore, we integrated it into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance (CFG) and proposed classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG). HD-CLIP leverages semantic cues to guide generative restoration while using degradation cues to suppress undesired hallucinations and artifacts. As a \textbf{plug-and-play module}, HD-CLIP can be seamlessly integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training, significantly improving detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in error-prone sequential planning tasks, highlighting their struggles and proposing a novel method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored potential of VLMs in visual sequential planning, particularly their ability to handle non-optimal steps (errors) and correct them to achieve goals.

Method: The authors propose CoSPlan for benchmarking VLMs in four domains and introduce SGI, a training-free method involving intermediate reasoning steps between initial and goal states.

Result: VLMs like Intern-VLM and Qwen2 perform poorly on CoSPlan, but SGI improves their performance by an average of 5.2%. SGI also generalizes to other planning tasks.

Conclusion: SGI enhances VLMs' reliability in corrective sequential planning and shows promise for broader applications, addressing a critical gap in their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive complex reasoning capabilities but remain largely unexplored in visual sequential planning, i.e., executing multi-step actions towards a goal. Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion generation methods are limited by fixed skeletal templates, hindering generalization to diverse topologies and textual conditions.

Method: The study proposes OmniZoo, a dataset with 140 species and 32,979 sequences, and a topology-aware autoregressive framework for motion generation.

Result: The framework produces coherent, plausible motions aligned with text prompts and supports cross-species style transfer.

Conclusion: OmniZoo and its framework address limitations in motion generation, enabling versatile and adaptable motion synthesis.

Abstract: Motion generation is fundamental to computer animation and widely used across entertainment, robotics, and virtual environments. While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics. Given a text prompt and a target skeleton, our method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions, and further enables cross-species motion style transfer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, outperforming existing methods across modalities and pathologies.

Conclusion: TranSamba offers an efficient and effective solution for volumetric medical segmentation, with open-source availability.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation offers a label-efficient solution to train segmentation models for volumetric medical imaging. However, existing approaches often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the inherent volumetric nature of the data. We propose TranSamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture designed to capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation. TranSamba augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, which leverage the linear complexity of state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices. The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization. TranSamba achieves effective volumetric modeling with time complexity that scales linearly with the input volume depth and maintains constant memory usage for batch processing. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TranSamba establishes new state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse modalities and pathologies.

### [32] [mmCounter: Static People Counting in Dense Indoor Scenarios Using mmWave Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10357)
*Tarik Reza Toha,Shao-Jung,Lu,Shahriar Nirjon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmCounter accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces using ultra-low frequency signals from breathing and micro-movements, achieving high accuracy despite dense groupings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in detecting static individuals in dense groups due to mmWave radars' limitations in spatial resolution and reliance on movement.

Method: mmCounter extracts ultra-low frequency signals (<1 Hz) from breathing and micro-movements, applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate signals from noise and map them to individuals.

Result: mmCounter achieves an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and 60% F1 score in untested ones, counting up to seven people in tight spaces.

Conclusion: mmCounter demonstrates robust performance in counting static individuals in dense indoor settings, overcoming mmWave radar limitations.

Abstract: mmWave radars struggle to detect or count individuals in dense, static (non-moving) groups due to limitations in spatial resolution and reliance on movement for detection. We present mmCounter, which accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces (up to three people per square meter). mmCounter achieves this by extracting ultra-low frequency (< 1 Hz) signals, primarily from breathing and micro-scale body movements such as slight torso shifts, and applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects. Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori. In contrast, mmCounter utilizes a novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline to extract relevant low-frequency sources along with their spatial information and map these sources to individual people, enabling accurate counting. Extensive evaluations in various environments demonstrate that mmCounter delivers an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and a 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in previously untested environments. It can count up to seven individuals in a three square meter space, such that there is no side-by-side spacing and only a one-meter front-to-back distance.

Conclusion: The Video Toolkit and STAR framework advance autonomous video analysis, offering significant improvements in MLLM capabilities.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) task serves as a critical playground for evaluating whether foundation models can effectively perceive, understand, and reason about dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding the causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex and reasoning-intensive VideoQA task. In this work, we equip MLLM with a comprehensive and extensible Video Toolkit, to enhance MLLM's spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities and ensure the harmony between the quantity and diversity of tools. To better control the tool invocation sequence and avoid toolchain shortcut issues, we propose a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools, thereby progressively localizing the key area in the video. Our STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving an 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench. We believe that our proposed Video Toolkit and STAR framework make an important step towards building autonomous and intelligent video analysis assistants.

TL;DR: Visual Funnel improves MLLMs by addressing 'Contextual Blindness' through a two-step, training-free method that preserves hierarchical context via entropy-scaled crops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained visual details due to 'Contextual Blindness', limiting precision-demanding tasks.

Method: Proposes Visual Funnel: Contextual Anchoring identifies regions of interest, and Entropy-Scaled Portfolio dynamically scales crops based on attention entropy.

Result: Outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines, showing hierarchical structure is key.

Conclusion: Visual Funnel effectively resolves Contextual Blindness by preserving structural diversity in inputs without training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, but often fail to perceive fine-grained visual details, limiting their applicability in precision-demanding tasks. While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: "Contextual Blindness". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P2S is a training-free framework for zero-shot long video moment retrieval, addressing inefficiencies in search and refine phases with adaptive span generation and query decomposition, outperforming supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long video moment retrieval face scalability, generalization, and computational challenges, prompting the need for a zero-shot solution.

Method: P2S introduces an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to avoid candidate explosion in search and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without costly VLM verification.

Result: P2S outperforms supervised state-of-the-art methods, achieving +3.7% improvements on benchmarks like MAD.

Conclusion: P2S successfully addresses the inefficiencies and costs of existing LVMR methods, demonstrating superior performance without task-specific training.

Abstract: Zero-shot Long Video Moment Retrieval (ZLVMR) is the task of identifying temporal segments in hour-long videos using a natural language query without task-specific training. The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \textbf{P}oint-\textbf{to}-\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases. P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification. To our knowledge, P2S is the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming supervised state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin (e.g., +3.7\% on R5@0.1 on MAD).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoherentGS enhances 3DGS for sparse, blurry images using a dual-prior strategy combining deblurring and diffusion models, outperforming existing methods with as few as 3-9 views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DGS relies on dense, high-quality imagery, failing with sparse, blurry inputs common in real-world scenarios.

Method: CoherentGS uses a dual-prior approach: a deblurring network for sharp details and a diffusion model for geometric priors, supported by consistency-guided camera exploration and depth regularization.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative tests on synthetic and real scenes show CoherentGS outperforms existing methods, even with only 3-9 input views.

Conclusion: CoherentGS sets a new benchmark for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images, offering significant improvements.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a state-of-the-art method for novel view synthesis. However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. Our results demonstrate that CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for this challenging task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RaLiFlow, a novel framework for 4D radar-LiDAR fusion in scene flow estimation, addressing challenges like radar noise and lack of datasets, and demonstrating superior performance over single-modal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore untapped potential in combining 4D radar and LiDAR for scene flow estimation, leveraging radar's cost-effectiveness, weather robustness, and velocity detection.

Method: The method involves creating a Radar-LiDAR dataset, preprocessing radar data for denoising, and proposing RaLiFlow with a Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and tailored loss functions.

Result: RaLiFlow outperforms existing single-modal methods, showing significant improvements in scene flow estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that radar-LiDAR fusion is viable and effective, with RaLiFlow setting a new benchmark for multimodal scene flow estimation.

Abstract: Recent multimodal fusion methods, integrating images with LiDAR point clouds, have shown promise in scene flow estimation. However, the fusion of 4D millimeter wave radar and LiDAR remains unexplored. Unlike LiDAR, radar is cheaper, more robust in various weather conditions and can detect point-wise velocity, making it a valuable complement to LiDAR. However, radar inputs pose challenges due to noise, low resolution, and sparsity. Moreover, there is currently no dataset that combines LiDAR and radar data specifically for scene flow estimation. To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas. Extensive experiments on the repurposed scene flow dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by a significant margin.

TL;DR: A novel Deep Learning pipeline is introduced for precise feature matching in endoscopic images, addressing challenges like weak perspective cues and tissue reflections. It uses self-supervised training and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate spatial understanding is crucial for image-guided surgery and augmented reality. Conventional computer vision techniques struggle with surgical challenges, necessitating domain-specific solutions.

Method: A Deep Learning pipeline with a self-supervised optimization framework, leveraging novel-view synthesis for ground-truth correspondences and contrastive learning.

Result: The pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the SCARED dataset, achieving higher matching precision and lower epipolar error.

Conclusion: The framework advances computer vision applications in surgical endoscopy by enabling more accurate feature matching.

Abstract: Accurate spatial understanding is essential for image-guided surgery, augmented reality integration and context awareness. In minimally invasive procedures, where visual input is the sole intraoperative modality, establishing precise pixel-level correspondences between endoscopic frames is critical for 3D reconstruction, camera tracking, and scene interpretation. However, the surgical domain presents distinct challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and complex, deformable anatomy degrade the performance of conventional computer vision techniques. While Deep Learning models have shown strong performance in natural scenes, their features are not inherently suited for fine-grained matching in surgical images and require targeted adaptation to meet the demands of this domain. This research presents a novel Deep Learning pipeline for establishing feature correspondences in endoscopic image pairs, alongside a self-supervised optimization framework for model training. The proposed methodology leverages a novel-view synthesis pipeline to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, subsequently utilized for mining triplets within a contrastive learning paradigm. Through this self-supervised approach, we augment the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer, specifically optimized to produce embeddings that facilitate direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methodologies on the SCARED datasets improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to the related work. The proposed framework constitutes a valuable contribution toward enabling more accurate high-level computer vision applications in surgical endoscopy.

Conclusion: The FROW benchmark and proposed strategies effectively enhance LVLMs' fine-grained recognition, with significant accuracy improvements demonstrated.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable progress, enabling sophisticated vision-language interaction and dialogue applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on reasoning tasks, often neglecting fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Recognition Open World (FROW) benchmark, designed for detailed evaluation of LVLMs with GPT-4o. On the basis of that, we propose a novel optimization strategy from two perspectives: \textit{data construction} and \textit{training process}, to improve the performance of LVLMs. Our dataset includes mosaic data, which combines multiple short-answer responses, and open-world data, generated from real-world questions and answers using GPT-4o, creating a comprehensive framework for evaluating fine-grained recognition in LVLMs. Experiments show that mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1\% and open-world data boosts FROW benchmark accuracy by 10\%-20\% and content accuracy by 6\%-12\%. Meanwhile, incorporating fine-grained data into the pre-training phase can improve the model's category recognition accuracy by up to 10\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based method for point cloud denoising, balancing accuracy, edge preservation, and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud denoising methods often compromise between accuracy and efficiency, failing to preserve edges and fine details while maintaining real-time performance.

Method: Uses octree spatial partitioning, adaptive voxel occupancy statistics, kNN density estimation, and a gravitational scoring function combining density and adaptive distance weights.

Result: The method improves F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance metrics while reducing processing time on various datasets.

Conclusion: The approach achieves high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.

Abstract: High-quality point cloud data is a critical foundation for tasks such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.

TL;DR: MultiHateLoc is a weakly-supervised framework addressing temporal localisation of multimodal hate speech in videos, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks effective temporal localisation of hate speech in videos under weak supervision.

Method: MultiHateLoc uses modality-aware temporal encoders, dynamic fusion, contrastive alignment, and MIL objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HateMM and MultiHateClip datasets.

Conclusion: MultiHateLoc offers fine-grained, interpretable localisation with only video-level labels.

Abstract: The rapid growth of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.

Motivation: Existing vectorized road extraction methods fail in off-road environments due to lack of datasets and structural weaknesses in models like SAM-Road.

Method: Introduces WildRoad dataset and MaGRoad, a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths for robust connectivity inference.

Result: MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on WildRoad and urban datasets, with 2.5x faster inference.

Conclusion: WildRoad and MaGRoad provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in challenging environments, improving practical applicability.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced vectorized road extraction in urban settings, yet off-road environments remain underexplored and challenging. A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability. Together, the dataset and path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in the wild.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with 63% error reduction and achieves sub-meter, sub-degree accuracy on CARLA and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization in synthetic and real-world settings.

Abstract: Aerial-ground localization is difficult due to large viewpoint and modality gaps between ground-level LiDAR and overhead imagery. We propose TransLocNet, a cross-modal attention framework that fuses LiDAR geometry with aerial semantic context. LiDAR scans are projected into a bird's-eye-view representation and aligned with aerial features through bidirectional attention, followed by a likelihood map decoder that outputs spatial probability distributions over position and orientation. A contrastive learning module enforces a shared embedding space to improve cross-modal alignment. Experiments on CARLA and KITTI show that TransLocNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing localization error by up to 63% and achieving sub-meter, sub-degree accuracy. These results demonstrate that TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization in both synthetic and real-world settings.

<details>

Motivation: Existing TTA methods lack theoretical understanding of performance degradation under domain shifts, prompting exploration of Neural Collapse (NC) principles to address sample-wise misalignment.

Method: Extends NC to sample-wise level, identifying Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+). Proposes NCTTA, a feature-classifier alignment method using hybrid targets to mitigate unreliable pseudo-labels under domain shifts.

Result: NCTTA significantly improves robustness to domain shifts, outperforming Tent by 14.52% on ImageNet-C.

Conclusion: Sample-wise misalignment under domain shifts necessitates feature-classifier alignment, addressed effectively by NCTTA, enhancing TTA performance.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data by updating the model online during inference, yet existing methods lack theoretical insights into the fundamental causes of performance degradation under domain shifts. Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose NCTTA, a novel feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels, which blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NCTTA in enhancing robustness to domain shifts. For example, NCTTA outperforms Tent by 14.52% on ImageNet-C.

Abstract: This work presents an efficient algorithmic framework for real-time identification, classification, and evaluation of human physiotherapy exercises using mobile devices.

Extracted body keypoints are transformed into trigonometric angle-based features and classified with lightweight supervised models to generate frame-level pose predictions and accuracy scores. To recognize full exercise movements and detect deviations from prescribed patterns, we employ a dynamic-programming scheme based on a modified Levenshtein distance algorithm, enabling robust sequence matching and localization of inaccuracies. The system operates entirely on the client side, ensuring scalability and real-time performance. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology and highlights its applicability to remote physiotherapy supervision and m-health applications.

Motivation: Existing frameworks face a trade-off between temporal alignment accuracy and error propagation in ME/MC. Separate-transform causes error propagation, while unified-transform underperforms in ME/MC.

Method: Proposes dual-domain progressive temporal alignment (coarse pixel-domain and refined latent-domain) and QCMoE for quality-consistent streaming. Uses FGDT for LTMR and dynamic quantization adjustment.

Result: Achieves competitive rate-distortion performance and eliminates error propagation.

Conclusion: The presented framework enhances temporal alignment and avoids error propagation, offering superior performance for learned video compression.

Abstract: Existing frameworks for learned video compression suffer from a dilemma between inaccurate temporal alignment and error propagation for motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC). The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation.

### [47] [Robust Shape from Focus via Multiscale Directional Dilated Laplacian and Recurrent Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10498)
*Khurram Ashfaq,Muhammad Tariq Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework for Shape-from-Focus (SFF) that combines traditional multi-scale focus volumes with a lightweight GRU-based depth extraction module and learned convex upsampling to produce high-quality depth maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based SFF methods suffer from artifacts and noise amplification due to simplistic aggregation techniques and heavy feature encoders.

Method: The method uses Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels for robust focus volumes, a lightweight GRU module for iterative depth refinement, and learned convex upsampling for high-resolution reconstruction.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework addresses limitations of existing SFF methods, achieving superior performance while preserving fine details and sharp boundaries.

Abstract: Shape-from-Focus (SFF) is a passive depth estimation technique that infers scene depth by analyzing focus variations in a focal stack. Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

*Pasquale De Marinis,Gennaro Vessio,Giovanna Castellano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaP enhances encoder adaptability in few-shot semantic segmentation using Low-Rank Adaptation, improving performance across benchmarks with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focused on decoders, but the encoder's limited feature extraction for unseen classes remains a bottleneck.

Method: TaP uses LoRA to fine-tune the encoder on the support set, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Result: TaP improves segmentation performance across diverse models and datasets, including multi-class scenarios, with low-rank adaptations ensuring efficiency.

Conclusion: TaP addresses encoder generalization in FSS, leading to more robust and efficient segmentation systems.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes in query images using only a small annotated support set. While prior research has mainly focused on improving decoders, the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. In this work, we introduce \textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings. A rank sensitivity analysis also shows that strong performance can be achieved even with low-rank adaptations, ensuring computational efficiency. By addressing a critical limitation in FSS--the encoder's generalization to novel classes--TaP paves the way toward more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems.

*Yuchen Feng,Zhenyu Zhang,Naibin Gu,Yilong Chen,Peng Fu,Zheng Lin,Shuohuan Wang,Yu Sun,Hua Wu,Weiping Wang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blink is a dynamic visual token resolution framework inspired by human perception, enhancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by selectively focusing on salient regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack efficient visual perception akin to humans, who dynamically scan and focus on salient regions. Blink aims to emulate this human-like process.

Method: Blink uses saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution to estimate and extend important tokens, balancing broad exploration and fine-grained focus.

Result: Experiments show Blink effectively improves visual perception and multimodal understanding in MLLMs.

Conclusion: Blink successfully enhances MLLMs by mimicking human visual perception strategies, offering adaptive and efficient improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various vision-language tasks, yet their visual perception remains limited. Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential "blink-like" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GETok enhances MLLMs' ability to ground objects in 2D space by integrating spatial tokens, improving performance without altering the autoregressive architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with accurate object grounding in 2D space due to tokenization limitations.

Method: Introduces GETok, a method using grid and offset tokens to partition and refine object localization in images.

Result: GETok outperforms state-of-the-art methods in referring tasks across supervised and reinforcement learning settings.

Conclusion: GETok effectively addresses spatial grounding in MLLMs, enhancing their 2D reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in vision understanding and reasoning. However, the autoregressive Transformer architecture used by MLLMs requries tokenization on input images, which limits their ability to accurately ground objects within the 2D image space. This raises an important question: how can sequential language tokens be improved to better ground objects in 2D spatial space for MLLMs? To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETok achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

*Meher Md Saad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Few-Shot Prototypical Network with a skeleton-based encoder and ST-GCN with MSTA improves ISLR accuracy and generalization in data-scarce conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and long-tail distribution in ISLR to bridge communication gaps for the DHH community.

Method: Uses episodic training for semantic metric space, integrates ST-GCN with MSTA for motion dynamics, and classifies signs by proximity to dynamic prototypes.

Result: Achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on WLASL, outperforming baselines by 13%, and shows strong zero-shot generalization on SignASL (30% accuracy).

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles data scarcity and rare signs, offering scalable ISLR solutions.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is critical for bridging the communication gap between the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community and the hearing world. However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data.

Motivation: Existing video editing methods lack fine-grained spatial/temporal controllability and audio-visual synchronization, which is crucial for engaging content.

Method: Introduces granularity-aware mask refiner for precise instance-level edits and a self-feedback audio agent for high-quality audio guidance.

Result: AVI-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, condition following, and audio-visual synchronization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the limitations of current methods, enhancing video editing with precise control and audio-visual sync.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation highlight that realistic audio-visual synchronization is crucial for engaging content creation. However, existing video editing methods largely overlook audio-visual synchronization and lack the fine-grained spatial and temporal controllability required for precise instance-level edits. In this paper, we propose AVI-Edit, a framework for audio-sync video instance editing. We propose a granularity-aware mask refiner that iteratively refines coarse user-provided masks into precise instance-level regions. We further design a self-feedback audio agent to curate high-quality audio guidance, providing fine-grained temporal control. To facilitate this task, we additionally construct a large-scale dataset with instance-centric correspondence and comprehensive annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AVI-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, condition following, and audio-visual synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on overly complex architectures and degradation prompts, while the authors believe well-crafted feature extraction and a symmetric design suffice for superior performance.

Method: Proposes SymUNet, a symmetric U-Net aligning feature scales and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, with additive fusion in skip connections. SE-SymUNet adds semantic enhancement via frozen CLIP features and cross-attention.

Result: SymUNet and SE-SymUNet achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: The symmetric U-Net design simplifies all-in-one image restoration, providing a stronger foundation for future advancements. Source code is publicly available.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to handle diverse degradations (e.g., noise, blur, adverse weather) within a unified framework, yet existing methods increasingly rely on complex architectures (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion models) and elaborate degradation prompt strategies. In this work, we reveal a critical insight: well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively. By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. We further propose a semantic enhanced variant, SE-SymUNet, which integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks validate the superiority of our methods. Both baselines SymUNet and SE-SymUNet establish simpler and stronger foundations for future advancements in all-in-one image restoration.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a salient object detection framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, featuring a noise-aware encoder and replaceable decoder, improving segmentation accuracy in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD methods assume low-noise conditions, ignoring real-world weather-induced noise. This work addresses the gap by designing a weather-aware framework.

Method: Introduces a one-hot noise indicator and a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM) to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation, compatible with mainstream decoders.

Result: Experiments on WXSOD show the NIFM-enhanced encoder improves accuracy under varying weather conditions across different training scales and configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances SOD performance in noisy weather scenarios while maintaining decoder compatibility.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD), a foundational task in computer vision, has advanced from single-modal to multi-modal paradigms to enhance generalization. However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations. Results show that the proposed SOD framework (particularly the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to a vanilla encoder.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSRT dataset and TRSLLaVA method for semantic retrieval of RS images using VLMs without training, achieving competitive results vs. supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the semantic gap in RS image retrieval and the lack of benchmarks for zero-shot VLM utility.

Method: Proposes TRSLLaVA, a training-free T2T matching approach leveraging VLM-generated captions in a unified textual space.

Result: Achieves mean Recall of 42.62% on RSITMD, surpassing zero-shot CLIP and some supervised models.

Conclusion: Structured text offers a powerful, cost-effective paradigm for RS image retrieval.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval of remote sensing (RS) images is a critical task fundamentally challenged by the \textquote{semantic gap}, the discrepancy between a model's low-level visual features and high-level human concepts. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.

Conclusion: TCAM demonstrates strong cross-task generalization, proving motion patterns aligned with vision-language representations are powerful for video understanding.

Abstract: We propose Track and Caption Any Motion (TCAM), a motion-centric framework for automatic video understanding that discovers and describes motion patterns without user queries. Understanding videos in challenging conditions like occlusion, camouflage, or rapid movement often depends more on motion dynamics than static appearance. TCAM autonomously observes a video, identifies multiple motion activities, and spatially grounds each natural language description to its corresponding trajectory through a motion-field attention mechanism. Our key insight is that motion patterns, when aligned with contrastive vision-language representations, provide powerful semantic signals for recognizing and describing actions. Through unified training that combines global video-text alignment with fine-grained spatial correspondence, TCAM enables query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions via multi-head cross-attention. On the MeViS benchmark, TCAM achieves 58.4% video-to-text retrieval, 64.9 JF for spatial grounding, and discovers 4.8 relevant expressions per video with 84.7% precision, demonstrating strong cross-task generalization.

TL;DR: DOCR-Inspector formalizes document parsing assessment by detecting and analyzing fine-grained errors, outperforming commercial and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for document parsing lack reliability due to dataset biases and obscure distinct error patterns, raising the need for comprehensive assessment.

Method: DOCR-Inspector uses VLM-as-a-Judge to identify and categorize errors into 28 predefined types, trained on DOCRcase-200K and employing Chain-of-Checklist reasoning.

Result: DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms models like Gemini 2.5 Pro on DOCRcaseBench, proving its effectiveness in quality assessment and refinement guidance.

Conclusion: DOCR-Inspector serves as both a practical evaluator and a tool for advancing document parsing systems, with models and code made available.

Abstract: Document parsing aims to transform unstructured PDF images into semi-structured data, facilitating the digitization and utilization of information in diverse domains. While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale.

While recent deep learning-based trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging benchmarks, their reliance on per-frame GPU inference poses a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, where compute, power, and connectivity are limited. We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap. K-Track reduces inference cost by combining sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, using principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence. This hybrid strategy enables 5-10X speedup while retaining over 85% of the original trackers' accuracy. We evaluate K-Track across multiple state-of-the-art point trackers and demonstrate real-time performance on edge platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and RTX Titan. By preserving accuracy while dramatically lowering computational requirements, K-Track provides a practical path toward deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, closing the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems.

TL;DR: TriDF is a benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection, evaluating perception, detection, and hallucination across multimodal deepfakes. It highlights their interdependence and aims to improve trustworthy detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative models has increased risks of synthetic media manipulation. Detecting and explaining such manipulations reliably is crucial for security and public trust.

Method: TriDF benchmarks 16 DeepFake types across images, videos, and audio. It evaluates perception (artifact identification), detection (classification), and hallucination (explanation reliability).

Result: Experiments show perception is key for reliable detection, but hallucination can disrupt decision-making. The interdependence of these aspects is crucial.

Conclusion: TriDF offers a unified framework to understand detection accuracy, artifact identification, and explanation reliability, aiding trustworthy DeepFake detection.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have made it increasingly easy to fabricate realistic portrayals of individuals, creating serious risks for security, communication, and public trust. Detecting such person-driven manipulations requires systems that not only distinguish altered content from authentic media but also provide clear and reliable reasoning. In this paper, we introduce TriDF, a comprehensive benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection. TriDF contains high-quality forgeries from advanced synthesis models, covering 16 DeepFake types across image, video, and audio modalities. The benchmark evaluates three key aspects: Perception, which measures the ability of a model to identify fine-grained manipulation artifacts using human-annotated evidence; Detection, which assesses classification performance across diverse forgery families and generators; and Hallucination, which quantifies the reliability of model-generated explanations. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show that accurate perception is essential for reliable detection, but hallucination can severely disrupt decision-making, revealing the interdependence of these three aspects. TriDF provides a unified framework for understanding the interaction between detection accuracy, evidence identification, and explanation reliability, offering a foundation for building trustworthy systems that address real-world synthetic media threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based systems struggle in dynamic environments, and end-to-end methods often fail to comply with explicit navigation commands.

Method: NaviHydra leverages navigation commands, BEV-based trajectory gathering, and introduces a compliance metric for evaluation.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM, showing improved controllability and safety.

Conclusion: NaviHydra effectively advances autonomous driving by integrating navigation guidance into end-to-end trajectory generation.

Abstract: The complexity of autonomous driving scenarios requires robust models that can interpret high-level navigation commands and generate safe trajectories. While traditional rule-based systems can react to these commands, they often struggle in dynamic environments, and end-to-end methods face challenges in complying with explicit navigation commands. To address this, we present NaviHydra, a controllable navigation-guided end-to-end model distilled from an existing rule-based simulator. Our framework accepts high-level navigation commands as control signals, generating trajectories that align with specified intentions. We utilize a Bird's Eye View (BEV) based trajectory gathering method to enhance the trajectory feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a novel navigation compliance metric to evaluate adherence to intended route, improving controllability and navigation safety. To comprehensively assess our model's controllability, we design a test that evaluates its response to various navigation commands. Our method significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art results in the NAVSIM benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XDen-1K is a large-scale, multi-modal dataset for real-world physical property estimation, particularly volumetric density, with 1,000 objects across 148 categories. It includes 3D models, X-ray scans, and a novel optimization framework for density field recovery, improving robotic manipulation and center-of-mass estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack real-world data on internal physical properties like volumetric density, which are crucial for predicting object behavior in robotics and simulation. XDen-1K fills this gap.

Method: Introduces XDen-1K dataset with multi-modal data (3D models, X-ray scans). Proposes an optimization framework for density field recovery from sparse X-ray views and enhances segmentation networks with X-ray data.

Result: Improves accuracy in center-of-mass estimation and robotic manipulation success rates, demonstrating practical value.

Conclusion: XDen-1K is a foundational resource for physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI, setting a new benchmark for future research.

Abstract: A deep understanding of the physical world is a central goal for embodied AI and realistic simulation. While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation. We believe XDen-1K will serve as a foundational resource and a challenging new benchmark, catalyzing future research in physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI.

TL;DR: Geo6DPose is a lightweight, training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D object pose estimation, addressing challenges like latency and connectivity by combining geometric filtering with visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the impracticality of large-scale, cloud-based models for real-world robotics due to latency, energy consumption, and connectivity issues.

Method: Geo6DPose uses foundation model visual features and geometric filtering to establish correspondences, followed by RANSAC and a weighted alignment metric for pose recovery.

Result: The method achieves sub-second inference on commodity GPUs, matching larger baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS) without training or cloud access.

Conclusion: Geo6DPose advances practical, fully local 6D perception for robotics by eliminating training, fine-tuning, and network dependency while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in zero-shot 6D object pose estimation has been driven largely by large-scale models and cloud-based inference. However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS). It requires no training, fine-tuning, or network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones, advancing practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a fast, accurate, and scalable method for photorealistic view synthesis from a single image, addressing limitations in prior models.

Method: SHARP regresses parameters of a 3D Gaussian scene representation via a neural network in a single feedforward pass, enabling real-time rendering.

Result: SHARP outperforms prior models, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43%, while speeding up synthesis significantly.

Conclusion: SHARP sets a new state of the art for photorealistic view synthesis, offering robust generalization and real-time performance.

Abstract: We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two complementary uncertainty measures—latent and predictive—for landmark-based segmentation in chest X-rays, validated through experiments and a new dataset (CheXmask-U).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation by addressing uncertainty estimation in landmark-based segmentation, which offers topological guarantees but lacks exploration.

Method: Combines hybrid neural network architectures (image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders) to derive latent and predictive uncertainty measures from variational latent spaces.

Result: Both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity and effectively identify unreliable predictions. A large-scale dataset (CheXmask-U) with uncertainty estimates is released.

Conclusion: Uncertainty estimation improves robustness and safety for landmark-based segmentation in chest X-rays, supported by experimental validation and public resources.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for the safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, enabling the identification of unreliable predictions and supporting human oversight. While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray. A fully working interactive demo of the method is available at huggingface.co/spaces/matiasky/CheXmask-U and the source code at github.com/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U.

TL;DR: SpaceDrive enhances VLM-based autonomous driving by incorporating explicit spatial encodings for better 3D understanding and trajectory planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack fine-grained 3D spatial understanding, crucial for physical-world interactions.

Method: SpaceDrive uses positional encodings for 3D spatial data, integrating them with visual tokens for semantic-spatial reasoning and direct trajectory output.

Result: Achieves top open-loop nuScenes performance and second-best closed-loop Driving Score of 78.02 on Bench2Drive.

Conclusion: Explicit spatial encoding improves VLM-based driving frameworks, advancing accuracy and performance.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods built on vision language models (VLMs) have undergone rapid development driven by their universal visual understanding and strong reasoning capabilities obtained from the large-scale pretraining. However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video depth estimation struggle with temporal inconsistencies or high computational costs, limiting practical use.

Method: VeloDepth uses a Propagation Module with flow-based warping and residual corrections to refine and propagate depth features, ensuring temporal consistency.

Result: Benchmark tests show VeloDepth excels in temporal consistency and accuracy while being faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: VeloDepth offers a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation in diverse applications.

Abstract: Depth estimation in videos is essential for visual perception in real-world applications. However, existing methods either rely on simple frame-by-frame monocular models, leading to temporal inconsistencies and inaccuracies, or use computationally demanding temporal modeling, unsuitable for real-time applications. These limitations significantly restrict general applicability and performance in practical settings. To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators. VeloDepth thus provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

Conclusion: IRG-MotionLLM outperforms baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement. The approach advances performance in text-to-motion generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion-aware large language models have shown remarkable promise for unifying motion understanding and generation tasks. However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFD simulations for coronary blood flow are computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale clinical workflows, limiting AI model training and CAD diagnosis accessibility.

Method: Developed an end-to-end pipeline automating coronary geometry extraction from CCTA, streamlined simulation data generation, and introduced a diffusion-based regression model for direct blood pressure prediction.

Result: The model achieved an R2 of 64.42%, RMSE of 0.0974, and normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, efficient solution for non-invasive blood pressure prediction, enhancing CAD diagnosis accessibility.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers, such as pressure gradients, for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches. This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis.

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether global semantic information or spatial structure in target representations drives generative training performance in diffusion models, finding spatial structure is key and proposing simple modifications to improve it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what aspect of target representations (global semantics or spatial structure) matters most for generative training performance in diffusion models.

Method: Conducts large-scale empirical analysis across 27 vision encoders, introduces two modifications (convolution layer replacement and spatial normalization) to accentuate spatial information transfer.

Result: Spatial structure, not global performance, drives generation performance; proposed iREPA method improves convergence speed across diverse setups.

Conclusion: Simple spatial-focused modifications outperform traditional methods, suggesting revisiting representational alignment mechanisms for generative training.

Abstract: Representation alignment (REPA) guides generative training by distilling representations from a strong, pretrained vision encoder to intermediate diffusion features. We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \textit{global} \revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

TL;DR: GLAT with IRM improves prostate cancer grading by refining patch selection and enhancing spatial consistency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in prostate cancer grading from WSIs due to large-scale data, heterogeneity, and irrelevant region inclusion motivate a better approach.

Method: Combines Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) and Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) for feature learning and patch selection.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six datasets with improved performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GLAT-IRM effectively addresses WSI grading challenges by refining patch selection and ensuring spatial consistency.

Abstract: Prostate cancer grading from whole-slide images (WSIs) remains a challenging task due to the large-scale nature of WSIs, the presence of heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty of selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation. Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses robustness challenges in computer vision caused by data distribution shifts and label noise, proposing SEPL to diversify features and improve domain generalization under noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness in computer vision is hindered by data distribution shifts and label noise, worsening spurious feature issues in deep layers. The paper aims to adapt existing methods to noisy settings.

Method: Proposes SEPL, combining feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It uses intermediate features, trains multiple probing classifiers with semi-supervised learning, and integrates predictions via crowdsourcing.

Result: SEPL enhances robustness of existing methods and shows potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

Conclusion: SEPL effectively addresses noise-induced challenges in domain generalization, offering a flexible and robust solution.

Abstract: While computer vision and machine learning have made great progress, their robustness is still challenged by two key issues: data distribution shift and label noise. When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

TL;DR: PoseGAM is a geometry-aware multi-view framework for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects, eliminating explicit feature matching and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods rely on explicit feature correspondences, which PoseGAM aims to bypass for unseen objects.

Method: PoseGAM uses multi-view templates and integrates object geometry via explicit points and learned features, supported by a large synthetic dataset.

Result: The framework achieves a 5.1% average AR improvement over prior methods, with up to 17.6% gains on specific datasets.

Conclusion: PoseGAM demonstrates strong generalization for unseen objects and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation, which predicts the transformation of an object relative to the camera, remains challenging for unseen objects. Existing approaches typically rely on explicitly constructing feature correspondences between the query image and either the object model or template images. In this work, we propose PoseGAM, a geometry-aware multi-view framework that directly predicts object pose from a query image and multiple template images, eliminating the need for explicit matching. Built upon recent multi-view-based foundation model architectures, the method integrates object geometry information through two complementary mechanisms: explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks. In addition, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset containing more than 190k objects under diverse environmental conditions to enhance robustness and generalization. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, yielding an average AR improvement of 5.1% over prior methods and achieving up to 17.6% gains on individual datasets, indicating strong generalization to unseen objects.

TL;DR: SWiT-4D is a sliding-window transformer for converting monocular videos into high-quality 4D meshes, leveraging image-to-3D priors and requiring minimal 4D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in converting monocular videos into 4D meshes due to limited datasets and reliance on 4D supervision. Advances in image-to-3D generation provide priors that can be utilized.

Method: SWiT-4D integrates with DiT-based image-to-3D generators, enabling lossless temporal 4D mesh generation from videos of any length. A trajectory module recovers global translation.

Result: SWiT-4D achieves high-fidelity geometry and temporal consistency with just one short video for fine-tuning, outperforming baselines in smoothness across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: SWiT-4D offers a practical, data-efficient solution for video-to-4D conversion, demonstrating superior performance with limited supervision.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 4D content generation, the conversion of monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes remains considerably challenging. The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

TL;DR: Introduces MiSI and MiSI-Bench to evaluate spatial reasoning in VLMs for microscopic entities, revealing gaps but potential in fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore VLMs’ ability in the novel domain of Microscopic Spatial Intelligence (MiSI) for scientific discovery.

Method: Developed MiSI-Bench, a benchmark with 163K QA pairs and 587K images from 4K molecular structures, testing nine tasks.

Result: Current VLMs lag behind humans but a fine-tuned 7B model shows promise, excelling in spatial tasks but struggling with scientific ones like hydrogen bond recognition.

Conclusion: VLMs have potential in MiSI but require domain knowledge integration for scientific AGI; MiSI-Bench datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Microscopic Spatial Intelligence (MiSI), the capability to perceive and reason about the spatial relationships of invisible microscopic entities, which is fundamental to scientific discovery. To assess the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in this domain, we propose a systematic benchmark framework MiSI-Bench. This framework features over 163,000 question-answer pairs and 587,000 images derived from approximately 4,000 molecular structures, covering nine complementary tasks that evaluate abilities ranging from elementary spatial transformations to complex relational identifications. Experimental results reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly below human level on this benchmark. However, a fine-tuned 7B model demonstrates substantial potential, even surpassing humans in spatial transformation tasks, while its poor performance in scientifically-grounded tasks like hydrogen bond recognition underscores the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge for progress toward scientific AGI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAMoCap, a framework called MoCapAnything for category-agnostic motion capture. It predicts 3D joint trajectories and recovers asset-specific rotations using a modular system, enabling motion capture for arbitrary 3D assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion capture pipelines are often species- or template-specific. The goal is to bridge this gap by creating a system capable of reconstructing animations for any rigged 3D asset from monocular video.

Method: MoCapAnything uses a factorized framework with three modules: Reference Prompt Encoder (extracts joint queries), Video Feature Extractor (computes visual descriptors and reconstructs mesh), and Unified Motion Decoder (produces trajectories). It includes a lightweight IK stage for rotation recovery.

Result: Experiments demonstrate high-quality skeletal animations and effective cross-species retargeting across diverse rigs. The system performs well on benchmarks and in-the-wild videos.

Conclusion: MoCapAnything enables scalable, prompt-driven motion capture for arbitrary assets, addressing limitations of traditional pipelines.

Abstract: Motion capture now underpins content creation far beyond digital humans, yet most existing pipelines remain species- or template-specific. We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PubTables-v2, a large-scale dataset for table extraction tasks, and uses it to evaluate domain-specialized vision-language models (VLMs) and develop POTATR, an image-to-graph extension for page-level table extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of annotated data has hindered progress in table extraction (TE), especially for tasks like multi-page table structure recognition. PubTables-v2 is created to address this gap and support challenging TE tasks.

Method: The authors develop PubTables-v2, a large-scale dataset, and use it to evaluate domain-specialized VLMs. They also introduce POTATR, an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer for comprehensive page-level TE.

Result: PubTables-v2 enables benchmarking multi-page table structure recognition and supports evaluation of VLMs. POTATR improves page-level TE by extending the Table Transformer framework.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the utility of PubTables-v2 for advancing TE research and introduces POTATR as a promising method for page-level table extraction. Resources will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Table extraction (TE) is a key challenge in visual document understanding. Traditional approaches detect tables first, then recognize their structure. Recently, interest has surged in developing methods, such as vision-language models (VLMs), that can extract tables directly in their full page or document context. However, progress has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of annotated data. To address this, we create a new large-scale dataset, PubTables-v2. PubTables-v2 supports a number of current challenging table extraction tasks. Notably, it is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating domain-specialized VLMs on these tasks and highlighting current progress. Finally, we use PubTables-v2 to create the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer to comprehensive page-level TE. Data, code, and trained models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based SVG generation methods struggle with complex semantics and visual coherence due to lack of visual signals during decoding.

Method: DuetSVG is trained on image and SVG datasets, generating both image and SVG tokens end-to-end, with a test-time scaling strategy for improved decoding.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs.

Conclusion: DuetSVG's multimodal approach and visual guidance significantly enhance SVG generation quality across diverse applications.

Abstract: Recent vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches have achieved impressive results on SVG generation. However, because they generate only text and lack visual signals during decoding, they often struggle with complex semantics and fail to produce visually appealing or geometrically coherent SVGs. We introduce DuetSVG, a unified multimodal model that jointly generates image tokens and corresponding SVG tokens in an end-to-end manner. DuetSVG is trained on both image and SVG datasets. At inference, we apply a novel test-time scaling strategy that leverages the model's native visual predictions as guidance to improve SVG decoding quality. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.

TL;DR: FoundationMotion is an automated pipeline for creating large-scale motion datasets, enhancing model performance in motion understanding and spatial reasoning without manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets limits the performance of state-of-the-art models in motion understanding. Manual annotation is costly and not scalable.

Method: The approach involves detecting and tracking objects in videos to extract trajectories, then using LLMs to generate fine-grained captions and QA pairs. The resulting datasets are used to fine-tune models like NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B.

Result: Models fine-tuned with FoundationMotion outperform strong closed-source (e.g., Gemini-2.5 Flash) and open-source (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-72B) baselines in motion understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: FoundationMotion offers a scalable solution for curating motion datasets, improving model performance in motion understanding and spatial reasoning without manual annotation.

Abstract: Motion understanding is fundamental to physical reasoning, enabling models to infer dynamics and predict future states. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets. Existing motion datasets are often constructed from costly manual annotation, severely limiting scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning. Using datasets produced by this pipeline, we fine-tune open-source models including NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B, achieving substantial improvements in motion understanding without compromising performance on other tasks. Notably, our models outperform strong closed-source baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and large open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion understanding datasets and benchmarks. FoundationMotion thus provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that enable effective fine-tuning of diverse models to enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method combining Gaussian Splatting and transformer-based prediction to achieve real-time, stable speech-driven talking heads with improved visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for speech-driven talking heads suffer from slow speed or temporal instability, limiting real-world applications.

Method: The approach maps Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models and employs transformer-based prediction of model parameters directly from audio for temporal consistency.

Result: The method generates real-time talking head videos from monocular video and audio inputs, demonstrating competitive quantitative and qualitative performance.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively addresses the limitations of current methods, enabling realistic and stable speech-driven avatars.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking heads have recently emerged and enable interactive avatars. However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot settings. Gaussian Splatting approaches are real-time, yet inaccuracies in facial tracking, or inconsistent Gaussian mappings, lead to unstable outputs and video artifacts that are detrimental to realistic use cases. We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. We introduce transformer-based prediction of model parameters, directly from audio, to drive temporal consistency. From monocular video and independent audio speech inputs, our method enables generation of real-time talking head videos where we report competitive quantitative and qualitative performance.

TL;DR: VL-JEPA is a vision-language model using Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) for predicting continuous embeddings instead of token generation, achieving stronger performance with fewer parameters and selective decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VL-JEPA aims to improve vision-language tasks by focusing on task-relevant semantics and reducing linguistic variability, while maintaining efficiency and performance.

Method: The model predicts continuous embeddings of target texts in an abstract representation space, using a lightweight text decoder at inference time. It compares against token-space VLM training.

Result: VL-JEPA outperforms standard VLMs with 50% fewer parameters, reduces decoding operations by 2.85x, and excels in open-vocabulary classification, retrieval, and VQA tasks.

Conclusion: VL-JEPA demonstrates superior efficiency and versatility across multiple vision-language tasks, while maintaining competitive performance with fewer parameters.

Abstract: We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.

Method: Introduces MeViS with 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions (text/audio) covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos. Benchmarks 15 methods across RVOS, AVOS, RMOT, and RMEG tasks. Proposes LMPM++.

Result: Existing methods show weaknesses in motion expression-guided tasks. LMPM++ achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: MeViS fills gaps in motion-focused datasets, enabling better video understanding algorithms. LMPM++ advances performance in RVOS/AVOS/RMOT tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a large-scale multi-modal dataset for referring motion expression video segmentation, focusing on segmenting and tracking target objects in videos based on language description of objects' motions. Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational bottleneck in processing high-volume multi-camera data for autonomous driving by avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inductive biases.

Method: Employs learnable scene tokens to holistically encode information from all image tokens across cameras and timesteps, avoiding geometry-specific representations.

Result: Achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput and superior driving performance on a large-scale dataset, with emergent scene decomposition capabilities.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that data-driven joint encoding is scalable and effective, challenging the necessity of 3D priors in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: We present Flex, an efficient and effective scene encoder that addresses the computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in end-to-end autonomous driving. Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that 3D priors are necessary, demonstrating that a data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers a more scalable, efficient and effective path for future autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: ClusIR is a novel unified framework for All-in-One Image Restoration that uses cluster-guided degradation modeling and adaptive restoration techniques, outperforming existing methods across diverse degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with explicit degradation modeling and adapting to complex or mixed degradations.

Method: ClusIR employs Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) for degradation recognition and expert routing, and Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM) for adaptive frequency refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments show ClusIR achieves competitive performance across various degradation scenarios.

Conclusion: ClusIR effectively bridges degradation semantics with frequency-domain modulation, achieving high-quality restoration results.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) aims to recover high-quality images from diverse degradations within a unified framework. However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance under several scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-RayZer is a self-supervised 3D vision model that learns 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images, outperforming prior methods like RayZer and supervised models in tasks like pose estimation and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in self-supervised pre-training for 3D-aware representations from multi-view images, proposing a method that avoids indirect inference and operates directly in 3D space.

Method: E-RayZer performs self-supervised 3D reconstruction with explicit geometry and introduces a novel fine-grained learning curriculum for scalability and convergence.

Result: E-RayZer outperforms RayZer in pose estimation, matches or surpasses supervised models like VGGT, and excels in transferring learned representations to 3D downstream tasks compared to leading models.

Conclusion: E-RayZer establishes a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training, demonstrating superior performance and potential for future applications in 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training has revolutionized foundation models for languages, individual 2D images and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. In this paper, we present E-RayZer, a self-supervised large 3D Vision model that learns truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images. Unlike prior self-supervised methods such as RayZer that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis, E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with Explicit geometry. This formulation eliminates shortcut solutions and yields representations that are geometrically grounded. To ensure convergence and scalability, we introduce a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an entirely unsupervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models such as VGGT. Furthermore, its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (e.g., DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks, establishing E-RayZer as a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training.

TL;DR: Group Diffusion leverages shared attention across images during inference, improving generation quality with larger groups and showing strong FID correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore collaborative image generation during diffusion model inference by sharing attention mechanisms across images, rather than generating images independently.

Method: Proposes Group Diffusion, enabling joint denoising of images by sharing attention across them, focusing on intra- and inter-image correspondence.

Result: Demonstrates a scaling effect—larger group sizes enhance cross-sample attention and generation quality. Achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256.

Conclusion: Cross-sample inference is a previously unexplored, effective mechanism for generative modeling, as shown by Group Diffusion's performance.

Abstract: In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Our work reveals cross-sample inference as an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Omni-Attribute addresses visual concept personalization by creating high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations using curated image pairs and dual-objective training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with information leakage and incoherent synthesis due to entangled visual factors in holistic embeddings.

Method: Curates semantically linked image pairs with annotations and uses dual-objective training (generative fidelity and contrastive disentanglement).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation.

Conclusion: Omni-Attribute successfully isolates and synthesizes specific image attributes, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

### [91] [Empowering Dynamic Urban Navigation with Stereo and Mid-Level Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10956)
*Wentao Zhou,Xuweiyi Chen,Vignesh Rajagopal,Jeffrey Chen,Rohan Chandra,Zezhou Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces StereoWalker, a robot navigation foundation model that uses stereo vision and mid-level vision priors (like depth estimation) to improve efficiency and performance over monocular-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of monocular vision in robot navigation models, which struggle with depth-scale ambiguity and require large datasets. Stereo and mid-level vision priors address these issues.

Method: StereoWalker augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision modules (depth estimation, pixel tracking) and uses a large stereo navigation dataset for training.

Result: StereoWalker achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art with only 1.5% of training data and outperforms it with full data. Stereo vision also yields better results than monocular input.

Conclusion: Relying solely on monocular vision is inefficient; incorporating stereo inputs and mid-level vision priors significantly improves robot navigation models in terms of data efficiency and performance.

Abstract: The success of foundation models in language and vision motivated research in fully end-to-end robot navigation foundation models (NFMs). NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.
  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data. We also observe that stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldLens is introduced as a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate generative world models across five aspects, addressing gaps in current assessments of visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative world models often produce visually convincing but physically or behaviorally flawed environments, highlighting the need for a standardized evaluation framework.

Method: WorldLens spans five evaluation dimensions: Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference. It also includes WorldLens-26K, a human-annotated dataset, and WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from annotations.

Result: No existing world model excels universally across all dimensions; some prioritize textures over physics, while others lack behavioral fidelity.

Conclusion: WorldLens provides a unified ecosystem for assessing world fidelity, standardizing evaluation beyond visual realism to include behavioral realism.

Abstract: Generative world models are reshaping embodied AI, enabling agents to synthesize realistic 4D driving environments that look convincing but often fail physically or behaviorally. Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.

*Tjark Behrens,Anton Obukhov,Bingxin Ke,Fabio Tosi,Matteo Poggi,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoSpace is a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that uses viewpoint conditioning instead of explicit depth or warping, achieving superior results in geometric consistency and perceptual comfort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of monocular-to-stereo synthesis without relying on explicit depth or warping, focusing on scalability and robustness.

Method: StereoSpace employs a canonical rectified space and viewpoint conditioning to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end, avoiding explicit geometry estimates.

Result: StereoSpace outperforms methods in warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories, excelling in sharp parallax and robustness for layered and non-Lambertian scenes.

Conclusion: The framework establishes viewpoint-conditioned diffusion as a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation, validated by perceptual and geometric metrics.

Abstract: We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. A canonical rectified space and the conditioning guide the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that excludes any ground truth or proxy geometry estimates at test time. The protocol emphasizes metrics reflecting downstream relevance: iSQoE for perceptual comfort and MEt3R for geometric consistency. StereoSpace surpasses other methods from the warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories, achieving sharp parallax and strong robustness on layered and non-Lambertian scenes. This establishes viewpoint-conditioned diffusion as a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation.

*Luciano Floridi,Jessica Morley,Claudio Novelli,David Watson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how LLMs mimic abductive reasoning due to training on human texts but lack true reasoning or understanding, impacting their evaluation and application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the nature of reasoning in LLMs and distinguish it from actual abductive reasoning, highlighting their limitations.

Method: Examines LLMs' stochastic token-completion process, compares it to human abductive reasoning, and provides examples.

Result: LLMs produce plausible but ungrounded outputs resembling reasoning, requiring critical assessment due to lack of truth verification.

Conclusion: LLMs aid idea generation but their outputs are unverified; five objections are addressed, with limitations acknowledged.

Abstract: This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.

*Yumou Wei,John Stamper,Paulo F. Carvalho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small language models (SLMs) can generate high-quality questions using a novel pipeline combining generation and probabilistic reasoning, validated by human experts and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of SLMs for automatic question generation as an alternative to large language models (LLMs) in learning analytics.

Method: A 'generate-then-validate' pipeline: expansive generation followed by selective validation using probabilistic reasoning. Evaluated with human experts and an LLM.

Result: Generated questions were judged to have clear answers and align well with learning objectives.

Conclusion: SLMs can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline leveraging their strengths.

Abstract: We explore the use of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation as a complement to the prevalent use of their large counterparts in learning analytics research. We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a "generate-then-validate" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.

### [96] [Workflow is All You Need: Escaping the "Statistical Smoothing Trap" via High-Entropy Information Foraging and Adversarial Pacing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10121)
*Zhongjie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the 'impossible trinity' in LLMs for long-form text generation—balancing low hallucination, logical coherence, and personalization—by proposing the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow mimicking expert journalist cognition. It improves truthfulness and acceptance rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with the 'impossible trinity' in vertical domains, leading to hallucination, lack of coherence, and impersonal output due to the Statistical Smoothing Trap.

Method: The DeepNews Framework includes a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism, schema-guided strategic planning, and adversarial constraint prompting to mimic expert cognitive processes.

Result: Experiments show a Knowledge Cliff at 15,000 characters and an HFR above 85% with high-redundancy input (30,000+ chars). DeepNews achieved a 25% acceptance rate vs. 0% for SOTA models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully mitigates LLM limitations in vertical domains, offering a scalable solution for expert-level text generation with reduced hallucination and improved coherence.

Abstract: Central to long-form text generation in vertical domains is the "impossible trinity" confronting current large language models (LLMs): the simultaneous achievement of low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression. This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. In an ecological validity blind test conducted with a top-tier Chinese technology media outlet, the DeepNews system--built on a previous-generation model (DeepSeek-V3-0324)-achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, significantly outperforming the 0% acceptance rate of zero-shot generation by a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model (GPT-5).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage prompting framework enhances personalized review responses by inferring personas from short texts and incorporating them into LLMs, improving relevance and diversity without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in generating personalized responses when user data is limited, as generic LLM outputs reduce engagement.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework: first infers explicit and implicit personas from reviews, then uses these to prompt LLMs for tailored replies, adjusting decoding temperature for diversity.

Result: Evaluated on a Korean food delivery app dataset, showing improved precision, diversity, and semantic consistency in responses.

Conclusion: Persona-augmented prompting effectively boosts response personalization and relevance without needing model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Personalized review response generation presents a significant challenge in domains where user information is limited, such as food delivery platforms. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful text generation capabilities, they often produce generic responses when lacking contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a two-stage prompting framework that infers both explicit (e.g., user-stated preferences) and implicit (e.g., demographic or stylistic cues) personas directly from short review texts. These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference. We evaluate our method using a real-world dataset collected from a Korean food delivery app, and assess its impact on precision, diversity, and semantic consistency. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of persona-augmented prompting in enhancing the relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning.

TL;DR: AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework, evaluates LLMs as clinical conversational agents by transforming static QA datasets into dynamic dialogues, using the CARE metric for multi-faceted assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static medical QA benchmarks lack evaluation of LLMs in dynamic, interactive clinical conversations and multi-faceted strategies beyond accuracy.

Method: AutoMedic transforms static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles for multi-turn dialogues, assessed via the CARE metric (Clinical conversational Accuracy, Efficiency/Strategy, Empathy, Robustness).

Result: AutoMedic provides automated, validated evaluation of clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for LLM development in medical applications.

Conclusion: AutoMedic effectively addresses the challenges of evaluating LLMs in dynamic clinical scenarios, enhancing their safe and trustworthy application.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a critical issue for safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in the medical domain. Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications.

*Jules Lahmi,Alexis Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines challenges in adapting English-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to other languages, comparing methods like translation-based pipelines, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy. It highlights dataset translation as a key bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accessibility of VLMs for non-English speakers by addressing the limitations of English-centric models.

Method: Comparison of translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy, evaluated using translated benchmarks and expert assessments.

Result: Dataset translation is a major bottleneck, with data quality issues impacting training and evaluation effectiveness.

Conclusion: Future efforts should prioritize native-language dataset collection and better translation strategies to enhance multilingual VLM performance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years, particularly in the development of Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that understand both visual and textual data. However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.

TL;DR: Confucius Code Agent (CCA) is an open-source AI coding agent for industrial-scale software engineering, featuring long-context reasoning, continual learning, and robust tool use via Confucius SDK.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coding agents lack industrial-scale performance or transparency; CCA bridges this gap with extensibility and strong results.

Method: Built on Confucius SDK, CCA uses hierarchical memory, persistent note-taking, modular tools, and a meta-agent for configuration refinement.

Result: CCA achieves 54.3% Resolve@1 on SWE-Bench-Pro, outperforming prior agents.

Conclusion: CCA and Confucius SDK offer transparent, scalable foundations for AI-driven software engineering.

Abstract: Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.

*David Ph. Shakouri,Crit Cremers,Niels O. Schiller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a multi-agent system for language acquisition, where a daughter agent learns abstract grammatical rules from mother agent-generated exemplars using statistical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how computational models can simulate language acquisition processes, particularly abstract grammatical knowledge, without direct access to internal linguistic structures.

Method: A two-agent system (mother and daughter models) was used, with hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis applied to mother-generated utterances to derive grammatical rules.

Result: Discrete grammatical rules resembling natural language categories were successfully acquired, validated through a parameter configuration test.

Conclusion: The study shows that non-trivial grammatical knowledge can be computationally acquired, mimicking natural language learning processes.

Abstract: This article presents experiments performed using a computational laboratory environment for language acquisition experiments. It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.

### [102] [Sliding Window Attention Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10411)
*Yijiong Yu,Jiale Liu,Qingyun Wu,Huazheng Wang,Ji Pei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SWAA adapts full-attention pretrained LLMs to sliding window attention (SWA) via five methods, effectively recovering long-context performance without pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic cost of self-attention in LLMs makes long-context inference expensive. SWA reduces this cost linearly, but naively applying SWA to FA-pretrained models degrades performance.

Method: SWAA combines five methods: SWA during prefilling, preserving 'sink' tokens, interleaving FA/SWA layers, chain-of-thought, and fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show SWA adaptation is feasible but requires synergistic combinations of methods to recover original long-context performance.

Conclusion: SWAA provides practical recipes for adapting FA-pretrained LLMs to SWA, balancing performance and efficiency for diverse scenarios.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

*Youmin Ko,Sungjong Seo,Hyunjoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoopRAG is a novel RAG framework improving QA accuracy by cooperative retriever-LLM interaction and layered retriever contrast, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address incorrect retrievals and hallucinations in existing RAG methods for QA tasks.

Method: Unrolls questions into sub-questions/masked reasoning chains, retrieves relevant documents, reranks via retriever layer contrast, and reconstructs chains using LLM.

Result: Outperforms SOTA QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets and one simple QA dataset.

Conclusion: CoopRAG enhances retrieval and QA performance through cooperative retriever-LLM interaction.

Abstract: Since large language models (LLMs) have a tendency to generate factually inaccurate output, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained significant attention as a key means to mitigate this downside of harnessing only LLMs. However, existing RAG methods for simple and multi-hop question answering (QA) are still prone to incorrect retrievals and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances. Our code is available.\footnote{https://github.com/meaningful96/CoopRAG}

A public web demo exposes reasoning and non-reasoning modes and illustrates the speedups achieved by our inference stack across domains. T-pro 2.0 thus serves as an accessible open system for building and evaluating efficient, practical Russian LLM applications.

*Agniva Maiti,Prajwal Panth,Suresh Chandra Satapathy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRAP detects and recovers adversarial plagiarism in scientific texts using statistical anomaly detection and semantic reconstruction, outperforming baselines with 23.67% restoration accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial text generation threatens scientific integrity by masking plagiarism with statistically improbable synonyms, which current methods struggle to detect and trace.

Method: SRAP combines a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) for anomaly detection with dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT) for semantic reconstruction.

Result: SRAP achieves 23.67% restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming zero-shot baselines (0.00%). Static decision boundaries prove necessary for robust detection.

Conclusion: SRAP effectively detects and reconstructs adversarial plagiarism, enabling forensic analysis by linking obfuscated phrases to their probable sources.

Abstract: The integrity and reliability of scientific literature is facing a serious threat by adversarial text generation techniques, specifically from the use of automated paraphrasing tools to mask plagiarism. These tools generate "tortured phrases", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. "counterfeit consciousness" for "artificial intelligence"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A conversational agent using LLMs, KG-BERT, and LSTM improves learning and emotions by analyzing multimodal student data in real time, showing better motivation and grades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance learning performance and emotional well-being in education by addressing limitations of prior chatbots focused solely on tutoring or emotional support.

Method: Combines LLMs, KG-BERT, and bidirectional LSTM with attention to classify cognitive and affective states using multimodal data (text, speech, behavior).

Result: Pilot study showed improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Integrating semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling holds promise for adaptive, student-centered education.

Abstract: This paper presents a psychologically-aware conversational agent designed to enhance both learning performance and emotional well-being in educational settings. The system combines Large Language Models (LLMs), a knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with attention to classify students' cognitive and affective states in real time. Unlike prior chatbots limited to either tutoring or affective support, our approach leverages multimodal data-including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends-to infer engagement, stress, and conceptual understanding. A pilot study with university students demonstrated improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods. These results underline the promise of integrating semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling to support adaptive, student-centered educational interventions.

*Lars G. B. Johnsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, trained only on surface forms, can reproduce syntactic contrasts (e.g., subject-auxiliary inversion and parasitic gap licensing) to infer underlying structural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs, despite lacking explicit grammatical rules, can exhibit sensitivity to syntactic structure through predictive training on surface forms.

Method: Evaluating LLMs (GPT-4, LLaMA-3) using prompts that elicit acceptability ratings for grammatical and ungrammatical variants of two classic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion and parasitic gap licensing.

Result: LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants, suggesting sensitivity to syntactic structure beyond linear order.

Conclusion: Structural generalizations emerge from predictive training on surface forms, indicating functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding.

Abstract: What counts as evidence for syntactic structure? In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar. In this paper, we test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms, reproduce these contrasts in ways that imply an underlying structural representation.
  We focus on two classic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing recognition of the subject boundary) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). We evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts eliciting acceptability ratings. Results show that LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, and as such support that they are sensitive to structure and not just linear order. Structural generalizations, distinct from cognitive knowledge, emerge from predictive training on surface forms, suggesting functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding.

*Iñaki Lacunza,José Javier Saiz,Alexander Shvets,Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre,Marta Villegas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses LLMs' bias towards high-resource languages by proposing XDoGE for multilingual optimization and CPT training, validating results on Iberian languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs over-rely on high-resource languages, limiting performance in mid- and low-resource languages. The study aims to mitigate this issue.

Method: Extends DoGE to XDoGE for multilingual setup, optimizes language distribution, and rescales data for training, validated on six Iberian languages.

Result: Developed IberianLLM-7B-Instruct, a model improved via CPT with XDoGE weights, focusing on Iberian languages and English.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances language representation in LLMs, enhancing performance for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive amounts of text data, primarily from a few dominant languages. Studies suggest that this over-reliance on high-resource languages, such as English, hampers LLM performance in mid- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to (i) optimize the language distribution by training a small proxy model within a domain-reweighing DoGE algorithm that we extend to XDoGE for a multilingual setup, and (ii) rescale the data and train a full-size model with the established language weights either from scratch or within a continual pre-training phase (CPT). We target six languages possessing a variety of geographic and intra- and inter-language-family relations, namely, English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), Galician and Basque (low-resource). We experiment with Salamandra-2b, which is a promising model for these languages. We investigate the effects of substantial data repetition on minor languages and under-sampling on dominant languages using the IberoBench framework for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we release a new promising IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model centering on Iberian languages and English that we pretrained from scratch and further improved using CPT with the XDoGE weights.

*Amartya Roy,Elamparithy M,Kripabandhu Ghosh,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,Adrian de Wynter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICL in LLMs struggles with causal reasoning; encoder and encoder-decoder models outperform decoder-only models in robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to clarify the role and performance of ICL in causal reasoning, which requires multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and to address the limitations of decoder-only models.

Method: The study compares fine-tuned encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only models with zero- and few-shot ICL in natural and non-natural language scenarios.

Result: ICL alone is unreliable for causal reasoning, decoder-only models are brittle to distributional shifts, while fine-tuned encoder and encoder-decoder models generalize better, especially in non-natural language tasks.

Conclusion: For cost-effective and robust causal reasoning, fine-tuned encoder or encoder-decoder models are preferable, as they outperform decoder-only models unless the latter are scaled significantly.

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) underpins recent advances in large language models (LLMs), although its role and performance in causal reasoning remains unclear. Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoleRMBench is introduced as the first benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, highlighting gaps in general-purpose models. RoleRM, trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences, outperforms existing models by 24%, emphasizing continuous preference representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models fail in subjective domains like role play due to inadequate capture of nuanced human judgments.

Method: RoleRM uses Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP) for training, reformulating subjective evaluation as continuous pairwise supervision.

Result: RoleRM surpasses other reward models by over 24%, excelling in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity.

Conclusion: Continuous preference representation and annotation consistency are crucial for subjective alignment in dialogue systems.

Abstract: Reward modeling has become a cornerstone of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet, when extended to subjective and open-ended domains such as role play, existing reward models exhibit severe degradation, struggling to capture nuanced and persona-grounded human judgments. To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous preference representation and annotation consistency, establishing a foundation for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgriGPT-Omni introduces a unified multimodal framework for agriculture, addressing data scarcity and lack of benchmarks by synthesizing speech datasets, training a three-stage omni-model, and proposing a tri-modal benchmark, outperforming general-purpose models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural applications lag due to scarce multilingual speech data, fragmented multimodal architectures, and missing benchmarks.

Method: Develops AgriGPT-Omni through scalable data synthesis, three-stage training (textual injection, multimodal alignment, GRPO reinforcement), and introduces AgriBench-Omni-2K benchmark.

Result: AgriGPT-Omni surpasses general models in multilingual, multimodal reasoning, and speech understanding.

Conclusion: The framework advances agricultural AI by releasing models, data, benchmarks, and tools for reproducibility and inclusivity.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the lack of multilingual speech data, unified multimodal architectures, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions.

*Smiljana Antonijevic Ubois*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores biases in low-resource language representation in AI, using Serbian as an example, and proposes Data Care, a framework for inclusive language technology development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses cultural and linguistic biases in AI models trained on dominant languages, highlighting the marginalization of low-resource languages like Serbian due to historical and sociotechnical factors.

Method: The research employs semi-structured interviews with ten experts (linguists, digital humanists, AI developers) to analyze challenges such as data bias and superficial transliteration, proposing Data Care as a solution.

Result: Findings reveal systemic issues like reliance on English-trained models and lack of culturally specific datasets, leading to a proposed Data Care framework for bias mitigation.

Conclusion: The Data Care framework, based on CARE principles, offers a replicable model for developing inclusive and culturally grounded language technologies to counter existing power imbalances.

Abstract: Large language models are commonly trained on dominant languages like English, and their representation of low resource languages typically reflects cultural and linguistic biases present in the source language materials. Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots.

TL;DR: A pipeline for detecting and mitigating biases in textual data used for LLMs, addressing representation bias and stereotypes, with mixed results in model performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to comply with regulations like the European AI Act and mitigate biases in LLM training data to prevent unfair outputs.

Method: Proposes a four-component pipeline: LLM-generated word lists for group labels, Demographic Representation Score for quantifying bias, sociolinguistic filtering for stereotypes, and counterfactual data augmentation for bias compensation.

Result: Successfully reduces representation bias and stereotypes in data but finds no consistent improvement in model bias benchmarks, indicating gaps in evaluation methods.

Conclusion: Targeted data manipulation is needed to address model bias, as debiasing data alone may not suffice.

Abstract: Textual data used to train large language models (LLMs) exhibits multifaceted bias manifestations encompassing harmful language and skewed demographic distributions. Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.

TL;DR: OPV combines outcome and process verification for accurate, efficient reasoning chain checks, outperforming larger models with active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current verifiers fail to inspect unreliable intermediate steps or detect errors in long reasoning chains due to annotation scarcity.

Method: Proposes OPV, an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations and Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) for improvement.

Result: OPV achieves an F1 score of 83.1, outperforms larger models, detects false positives, and boosts policy model performance.

Conclusion: OPV offers scalable, accurate verification for reasoning tasks, enhancing model reliability and performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in solving complex reasoning tasks by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \textbf{O}utcome-based \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out \textsc{\thisbench}, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, OPV consistently yields performance gains, e.g., raising the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2\% to 73.3\% on AIME2025 as the compute budget scales.

Motivation: Address performance gaps in emergency speech recognition for non-standard English varieties, ensuring equitable access to triage protocols.

Method: Three-layer architecture combining Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction, and bio-acoustic distress detection.

Result: Provides dispatchers with transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators.

Conclusion: TRIDENT offers a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI, though empirical validation on Caribbean calls is pending.

Abstract: Emergency speech recognition systems exhibit systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating a critical gap in services for Caribbean populations. We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.
  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.
  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that ensures Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.

TL;DR: Scaling pretrained models improves adaptation efficiency for lower-resource languages and reduces catastrophic forgetting, outperforming smaller models with continued pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of adapting high-performing language models to medium- and lower-resource languages efficiently.

Method: Conduct scaling ablations with FLOP-matched models, comparing upscaled English base models to standard continued pretraining.

Result: Upscaled models match or surpass smaller models' performance with less data, retain English capabilities, and merging shows promise.

Conclusion: Scaling is effective for data-efficient adaptation and preserving base capabilities, with merging offering modular multilingual potential.

Abstract: Achieving high-performing language models which include medium- and lower-resource languages remains a challenge. Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration.

TL;DR: LLMs show performance drops with romanized inputs in Indian maternal healthcare triage, risking millions of errors despite understanding semantic intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate LLM performance on romanized Indian language texts in high-stakes clinical settings, addressing a gap in real-world data research.

Method: Benchmarked leading LLMs using real-world queries in five Indian languages and Nepali, comparing native scripts vs. romanized text.

Result: Romanized texts degrade LLM reliability (5-12 F1 points lower), risking ~2M triage errors despite correct semantic understanding.

Conclusion: Romanization poses a safety blind spot for LLM health systems, as models understand intent but fail to classify reliably.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical applications in India. In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.

The suite provides a holistic measure of factuality by aggregating the performance of models on four distinct sub-leaderboards: (1) FACTS Multimodal, which measures the factuality of responses to image-based questions; (2) FACTS Parametric, which assesses models' world knowledge by answering closed-book factoid questions from internal parameters; (3) FACTS Search, which evaluates factuality in information-seeking scenarios, where the model must use a search API; and (4) FACTS Grounding (v2), which evaluates whether long-form responses are grounded in provided documents, featuring significantly improved judge models. Each sub-leaderboard employs automated judge models to score model responses, and the final suite score is an average of the four components, designed to provide a robust and balanced assessment of a model's overall factuality. The FACTS Leaderboard Suite will be actively maintained, containing both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding its integrity.

*Michael Schlee,Christoph Weisser,Timo Kivimäki,Melchizedek Mashiku,Benjamin Saefken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LabelFusion combines transformer-based classifiers and LLMs for accurate, cost-aware text classification, offering a simple interface and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage complementary strengths of LLMs and traditional transformers for improved accuracy and cost efficiency in text classification tasks.

Method: Concatenates embeddings from a transformer backbone with LLM-derived scores via prompt engineering, then processes them with a FusionMLP for predictions.

Result: Achieves 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on Reuters 21578 topic classification, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost.

Conclusion: LabelFusion effectively integrates LLMs and transformers, delivering robust performance and practical trade-offs in text classification.

Abstract: LabelFusion is a fusion ensemble for text classification that learns to combine a traditional transformer-based classifier (e.g., RoBERTa) with one or more Large Language Models (LLMs such as OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or DeepSeek) to deliver accurate and cost-aware predictions across multi-class and multi-label tasks. The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users. Under the hood, LabelFusion integrates vector signals from both sources by concatenating the ML backbone's embeddings with the LLM-derived per-class scores -- obtained through structured prompt-engineering strategies -- and feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) that produces the final prediction. This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.

### [122] [Norm-Governed Multi-Agent Decision-Making in Simulator-Coupled Environments:The Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09939)
*Stella C. Dong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes R-CMASP, a multi-agent model for reinsurance decision-making, addressing challenges like distributed information and regulatory constraints. It outperforms deterministic automation and monolithic LLMs in stability and adherence to norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinsurance decision-making involves complex, distributed, and regulated environments unsuitable for deterministic automation, motivating a multi-agent approach.

Method: R-CMASP extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs with simulator-coupled dynamics, role-specialized agents, and normative feasibility layers.

Result: R-CMASP shows improved stability, capital efficiency, and norm adherence compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems are ideal for regulated decision environments.

Abstract: Reinsurance decision-making exhibits the core structural properties that motivate multi-agent models: distributed and asymmetric information, partial observability, heterogeneous epistemic responsibilities, simulator-driven environment dynamics, and binding prudential and regulatory constraints. Deterministic workflow automation cannot meet these requirements, as it lacks the epistemic flexibility, cooperative coordination mechanisms, and norm-sensitive behaviour required for institutional risk-transfer.
  We propose the Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP), a formal model that extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by adding three missing elements: (i) simulator-coupled transition dynamics grounded in catastrophe, capital, and portfolio engines; (ii) role-specialized agents with structured observability, belief updates, and typed communication; and (iii) a normative feasibility layer encoding solvency, regulatory, and organizational rules as admissibility constraints on joint actions.
  Using LLM-based agents with tool access and typed message protocols, we show in a domain-calibrated synthetic environment that governed multi-agent coordination yields more stable, coherent, and norm-adherent behaviour than deterministic automation or monolithic LLM baselines--reducing pricing variance, improving capital efficiency, and increasing clause-interpretation accuracy. Embedding prudential norms as admissibility constraints and structuring communication into typed acts measurably enhances equilibrium stability.
  Overall, the results suggest that regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are most naturally modelled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.

*Jingyao Ren,Eric Ewing,T. K. Satish Kumar,Sven Koenig,Nora Ayanian*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores three challenges in Multi-agent Pathfinding (MAPF) empirical hardness: algorithm selection, identifying instance features affecting hardness, and generating hard instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretical complexity and varying actual hardness in MAPF instances.

Method: Investigates algorithm selection, instance features (e.g., phase transition, backbone/backdoor), and methods for generating hard instances.

Result: Establishes a foundation for future research on MAPF empirical hardness.

Conclusion: Encourages deeper exploration of empirical hardness challenges in MAPF.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding collision-free paths for a team of agents on a map. Although MAPF is NP-hard, the hardness of solving individual instances varies significantly, revealing a gap between theoretical complexity and actual hardness. This paper outlines three key research challenges in MAPF empirical hardness to understand such phenomena. The first challenge, known as algorithm selection, is determining the best-performing algorithms for a given instance. The second challenge is understanding the key instance features that affect MAPF empirical hardness, such as structural properties like phase transition and backbone/backdoor. The third challenge is how to leverage our knowledge of MAPF empirical hardness to effectively generate hard MAPF instances or diverse benchmark datasets. This work establishes a foundation for future empirical hardness research and encourages deeper investigation into these promising and underexplored areas.

### [124] [Emergent Collective Memory in Decentralized Multi-Agent AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10166)
*Khushiyant*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper shows how collective memory forms in decentralized multi-agent systems by combining individual agent memory and environmental traces. It highlights critical asymmetries and validates theoretical predictions through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how collective memory emerges in decentralized systems without centralized control, focusing on the roles of individual memory and environmental traces.

Method: Agent-based simulations with varying grid sizes (20x20 to 50x50), agent counts (5-20), and densities (rho in [0.049, 0.300]). Performance metrics include food efficiency and composite measures.

Result: Individual memory improves performance by 68.7% over no-memory baselines, while traces alone fail. Stigmergic coordination dominates at higher densities, outperforming memory by 36-41%. Theoretical predictions align closely with experiments.

Conclusion: Collective memory relies on both individual memory and environmental traces, with traces requiring cognitive infrastructure. The study confirms theoretical predictions and reveals dominance of stigmergic coordination at critical densities.

Abstract: We demonstrate how collective memory emerges in decentralized multi-agent systems through the interplay between individual agent memory and environmental trace communication. Our agents maintain internal memory states while depositing persistent environmental traces, creating a spatially distributed collective memory without centralized control. Comprehensive validation across five environmental conditions (20x20 to 50x50 grids, 5-20 agents, 50 runs per configuration) reveals a critical asymmetry: individual memory alone provides 68.7% performance improvement over no-memory baselines (1563.87 vs 927.23, p < 0.001), while environmental traces without memory fail completely. This demonstrates that memory functions independently but traces require cognitive infrastructure for interpretation. Systematic density-sweep experiments (rho in [0.049, 0.300], up to 625 agents) validate our theoretical phase transition prediction. On realistic large grids (30x30, 50x50), stigmergic coordination dominates above rho ~ 0.20, with traces outperforming memory by 36-41% on composite metrics despite lower food efficiency. The experimental crossover confirms the predicted critical density rho_c = 0.230 within 13% error.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A concurrent routing framework integrates LLMs into traffic environments, allowing real-time route planning without stopping, reducing wait times and decision latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLM-based agents to plan routes dynamically while moving, avoiding the inefficiency of stopping to deliberate and improving traffic flow.

Method: Uses a non-blocking asynchronous architecture with Unity coroutines and a request manager, operating on a weighted undirected graph with live congestion metrics.

Result: Agents achieve low decision latency (0.75s on average) and adapt dynamically to traffic, rerouting around congestion while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective real-time, adaptive routing and multi-agent cooperation, offering a foundation for future research.

Abstract: We present Thinking While Driving, a concurrent routing framework that integrates LLMs into a graph-based traffic environment. Unlike approaches that require agents to stop and deliberate, our system enables LLM-based route planning while agents are moving, significantly reducing intersection wait times. Under high traffic, agents average just 0.75 seconds of decision latency. To coordinate many agents in real-time, we implement a non-blocking asynchronous architecture using Unity coroutines and a dedicated request manager. The environment is a weighted undirected graph with live congestion metrics, updated continuously by the agents to enable shared perception. Our results show LLM-driven agents can dynamically adapt to traffic, reroute around congestion, and exhibit behaviors beyond static pathfinding, all while maintaining real-time performance. This work provides a reproducible framework for future research in adaptive routing and multi-agent cooperation.

*Akaash Chatterjee,Suman Kundu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ExaCraft is an AI system that generates personalized learning examples by adapting to learners' dynamic needs, leveraging user profiles and real-time behavior analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing educational AI tools lack the ability to generate context-aware, personalized examples that adapt to learners' evolving understanding and challenges.

Method: ExaCraft uses Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, to combine user profiles with real-time learner behavior analysis, adapting to five key learning context aspects.

Result: The system generates culturally relevant and tailored examples that evolve from basic to advanced concepts based on learner interactions like topic repetition and progression patterns.

Conclusion: ExaCraft demonstrates how AI can enhance learning by dynamically adapting to individual needs, improving engagement and effectiveness through personalized examples.

Abstract: Learning is most effective when it's connected to relevant, relatable examples that resonate with learners on a personal level. However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Suzume-chan, an Embodied Information Hub using Social Presence Theory to create a human-centered knowledge-sharing experience through physical and conversational interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of deep understanding and connection in digital tools for expert knowledge sharing.

Method: Proposes Suzume-chan, a soft AI agent with a language model and RAG, learning from spoken explanations and responding via dialogue to reduce psychological distance.

Result: The prototype enhances knowledge sharing by making it warmer and more interactive, fostering a sense of connection.

Conclusion: Suzume-chan demonstrates potential to humanize digital knowledge sharing, leveraging Social Presence Theory effectively.

Abstract: Access to expert knowledge often requires real-time human communication. Digital tools improve access to information but rarely create the sense of connection needed for deep understanding. This study addresses this issue using Social Presence Theory, which explains how a feeling of "being together" enhances communication. An "Embodied Information Hub" is proposed as a new way to share knowledge through physical and conversational interaction. The prototype, Suzume-chan, is a small, soft AI agent running locally with a language model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It learns from spoken explanations and responds through dialogue, reducing psychological distance and making knowledge sharing warmer and more human-centered.

*Chih-Han Chen,Chen-Han Tsai,Yu-Shao Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for health misinformation detection using agreement score prediction and multi-agent debate outperforms baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of health-related misinformation online, effective verification is crucial, requiring high-quality evidence retrieval and rigorous reasoning.

Method: The framework uses LLMs to predict an agreement score from retrieved articles; if consensus is low, it triggers a multi-agent debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate reasoned verdicts.

Result: The two-stage approach shows superior performance compared to baselines, emphasizing the value of automated scoring and collaborative reasoning.

Conclusion: Combining agreement score prediction with multi-agent debate enhances health misinformation detection, offering a robust solution for complex verification tasks.

Abstract: Fact-checking health-related claims has become increasingly critical as misinformation proliferates online. Effective verification requires both the retrieval of high-quality evidence and rigorous reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: Agreement Score Prediction followed by Multi-Agent Debate. In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage. Multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate well-reasoned verdicts with explicit justifications. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the value of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks.

*Moein Heidari,Mohammad Amin Roohi,Armin Khosravi,Ilker Hacihaliloglu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Echo-CoPilot is a multi-task agent using a large language model to integrate specialized echocardiography tools for unified clinical assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Echocardiography interpretation is complex and manual. Existing models perform isolated tasks without unified clinical coherence.

Method: The agent combines view recognition, segmentation, measurement, disease prediction, and report synthesis in a ReAct-style loop.

Result: Achieves 50.8% accuracy on MIMIC-EchoQA, outperforming general and biomedical models.

Conclusion: Echo-CoPilot integrates quantitative and contextual data for clinically coherent assessments.

Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-modal content, inconsistent information, and adaptability to schema changes in scientific literature.

Method: SciEx decouples components like PDF parsing, retrieval, extraction, and aggregation, enabling flexible integration of new models and strategies.

Result: Evaluated on datasets from three scientific topics, SciEx shows accurate and consistent fine-grained information extraction.

Conclusion: SciEx offers practical insights into LLM-based pipelines' strengths and limitations while improving adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly touted as powerful tools for automating scientific information extraction. However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently. Our findings provide practical insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based pipelines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DynaMate is a multi-agent framework that automates protein-ligand MD workflows, integrating dynamic tool use and self-correction to streamline simulations and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The technical complexity of MD setup for biomolecular systems hinders widespread use, prompting the need for an automated solution like DynaMate.

Method: DynaMate uses three specialized modules to plan experiments, perform simulations, and analyze results, employing dynamic tool use and iterative reasoning.

Result: Tested on twelve benchmark systems, DynaMate successfully executed MD simulations, corrected errors, and analyzed protein-ligand interactions.

Conclusion: DynaMate offers a standardized, scalable, and efficient approach for molecular modeling, advancing biomolecular and drug design applications.

Abstract: Force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable for probing the structure, dynamics, and functions of biomolecular systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes. Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions. This automated framework paves the way toward standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for future biomolecular and drug design applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in robotics research focused on large-scale urban scenarios, providing a realistic simulation platform for evaluating diverse robot capabilities.

Method: Developed SimWorld-Robotics (SWR) on Unreal Engine 5 for generating photorealistic urban scenes with dynamic elements, and introduced two benchmarks for multimodal instruction-following and multi-agent search tasks.

Result: State-of-the-art models, including VLMs, struggled with the benchmarks, highlighting limitations in perception, reasoning, and planning for urban environments.

Conclusion: SWR advances robotics research by offering scalable, realistic urban simulations and benchmarks, revealing current model shortcomings and guiding future improvements.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown promising results in developing generalist robotics that can perform diverse tasks in open-ended scenarios given multimodal inputs. However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.

*Logan Robbins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The abstract introduces the Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT), a parameter-efficient method to enable parallel decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) without retraining, addressing coherence drift issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in LLMs causes latency bottlenecks and lacks cross-stream communication in existing parallel methods.

Method: PDT uses Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC) adapters for parallel streams to synchronize via a shared latent space, solving coordination as a speculative consensus problem.

Result: PDT achieves 77.8% precision in coverage prediction and effectively self-corrects without modifying the base model's weights.

Conclusion: PDT offers a scalable and efficient solution for structured parallel generation in LLMs, avoiding full model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.

*Dani Roytburg,Beck Miller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the structural divide between AI safety and AI ethics, showing limited collaboration, and advocates for integration to build robust and just AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid development of AI necessitates alignment research, but the fields of AI safety and ethics operate in isolation, hindering progress.

Method: A bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025) was conducted.

Result: Over 80% of collaborations occur within either safety or ethics, with cross-field connectivity relying on a few key papers (5%) accounting for 85% of bridging links.

Conclusion: Integration of safety and ethics through shared benchmarks and cross-disciplinary collaboration is crucial for developing aligned and just AI systems.

Abstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, "aligned" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.

*Paul Bouchaud,Pedro Ramaciotti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs encode sociodemographic traits through indirect cues like names and occupations, revealing linear, interpretable representations that influence model behavior and highlight potential fairness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes inferred from indirect cues and assess whether these encoded biases influence model behavior, even in models deemed unbiased by benchmarks.

Method: Residual streams across layers of four transformer-based LLMs were probed using explicit and implicit demographic cues (names and occupations). Linear representations were analyzed for interpretability and correlation with real-world statistics.

Result: LLMs develop linear, interpretable representations of demographics. Names trigger census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations correlate with workforce statistics. These representations influence downstream tasks like career recommendations.

Conclusion: Even models passing bias tests may harbor implicit biases encoded through indirect cues, impacting fairness in large-scale applications.

Abstract: We investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners inferred from indirect cues such as names and occupations. We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.

*Nick Jiang,Xiaoqing Sun,Lisa Dunlap,Lewis Smith,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAE embeddings provide a cost-effective, reliable, and controllable alternative to LLMs and dense embeddings for analyzing large text corpora, uncovering insights like dataset differences and concept correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and interpretable methods to analyze large text corpora, addressing limitations of current techniques like LLMs and dense embeddings.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create interpretable SAE embeddings, applied to four data analysis tasks.

Result: SAE embeddings outperform LLMs and dense embeddings in cost, reliability, and controllability, revealing insights like semantic dataset differences and model biases.

Conclusion: SAEs are a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis, emphasizing the importance of model interpretation through data.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale text corpora is a core challenge in machine learning, crucial for tasks like identifying undesirable model behaviors or biases in training data. Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding "trigger" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.

*Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Abhay Goyal,Lam Yin Cheung,Roy Ka-Wei Lee,Koustuv Saha,Pi Zonooz,Navin Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates conspiratorial narratives in Singaporean Telegram groups using a two-stage computational framework, revealing their integration into everyday discourse and identifying seven narrative archetypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the structure and spread of conspiratorial discourse in digital ecosystems, challenging assumptions about its confinement to echo chambers.

Method: A fine-tuned RoBERTa-large model classifies messages, followed by constructing a signed belief graph weighted by textual similarity. A Sign Disentanglement Loss is used in a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN).

Result: The framework identifies seven narrative archetypes and achieves strong clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38), outperforming baselines. Conspiratorial content appears in routine discussions, not just skepticism-focused clusters.

Conclusion: The findings highlight conspiratorial discourse's embeddedness in ordinary social interactions, advancing computational methods for belief-driven analysis with applications in stance detection and content moderation.

Abstract: Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.
  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgriRegion introduces a region-aware RAG framework for agriculture, reducing hallucinations and improving local accuracy in advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs often provide incorrect agricultural advice due to regional variations, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: Uses geospatial metadata injection and region-prioritized re-ranking to ensure local accuracy in advice.

Result: Reduces hallucinations by 10-20% and improves trust scores compared to existing LLMs.

Conclusion: AgriRegion effectively addresses regional disparities in agricultural advice, enhancing reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in democratizing access to information. However, in the domain of agriculture, general-purpose models frequently suffer from contextual hallucination, which provides non-factual advice or answers are scientifically sound in one region but disastrous in another due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations. We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation.

*Alexander Wan,Kevin Klyman,Sayash Kapoor,Nestor Maslej,Shayne Longpre,Betty Xiong,Percy Liang,Rishi Bommasani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index (FMTI) shows a decline in transparency among foundation model developers, with average scores dropping from 58 to 40, highlighting opacity in training data, compute, and post-deployment impacts. IBM excels with a score of 95, while xAI and Midjourney score lowest at 14. Policy interventions are needed to address transparency gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess and quantify the transparency practices of foundation model developers, especially as their influence grows globally. It tracks changes over time and evaluates new companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI.

Method: The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring, comparing scores from 2024 to 2025. Companies are scored out of 100 based on their transparency practices.

Result: Transparency declined from 2024 to 2025, with average scores falling from 58 to 40. IBM scored highest (95), while xAI and Midjourney scored lowest (14). Companies are opaque about training data, compute, and model impacts.

Conclusion: Despite some companies excelling (e.g., IBM), overall transparency deteriorated. Policymakers must enforce stricter mandates to address critical transparency gaps in the foundation model industry.

Abstract: Foundation model developers are among the world's most important companies. As these companies become increasingly consequential, how do their transparency practices evolve? The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits.

TL;DR: CP-Env is a dynamic hospital environment simulator designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways, revealing their struggles with complexity and highlighting performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to assess LLMs in dynamic clinical settings, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation framework for real-world healthcare applications.

Method: CP-Env simulates hospital workflows with patient and physician agents, using a three-tiered framework (Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, Professional Ethics) for evaluation.

Result: Most LLMs struggle with clinical pathway complexity, showing hallucinations and lost details. Excessive reasoning sometimes harms performance, while top models reduce tool reliance.

Conclusion: CP-Env enhances medical AI development by providing realistic clinical evaluations, with tools available for further research.

Abstract: Medical care follows complex clinical pathways that extend beyond isolated physician-patient encounters, emphasizing decision-making and transitions between different stages. Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios. We introduce CP-Env, a controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways. CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction. Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution. We propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics. Results reveal that most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Interestingly, excessive reasoning steps can sometimes prove counterproductive, while top models tend to exhibit reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge. CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation. We provide the benchmark and evaluation tools for further research and development at https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/CP-Env.

TL;DR: The paper explores using multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize sequences of operators for efficiency in optimization and search processes, addressing gaps in multi-objective cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiency in optimization remains a challenge, with multi-objective cases underexplored despite promising results using operator pools.

Method: Proposes a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach to generalize experiences and optimize operator sequences.

Result: Certain stages completed show promise, but further phases remain outstanding to fully demonstrate efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach offers potential solutions but requires more investigation to validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Efficiency in optimisation and search processes persists to be one of the challenges, which affects the performance and use of optimisation algorithms. Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it. Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard. A generalised approach based on multi-objective reinforcement learning approach seems to create remedy for this issue and offer good solutions. This paper overviews a generalisation approach proposed with certain stages completed and phases outstanding that is aimed to help demonstrate the efficiency of using multi-objective reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of binary-only Predict-and-Search methods and improve handling of fixed variables in MIPs.

Method: Introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework for parametric MIPs, integrating ML with Predict-and-Search.

Result: ID-PaS outperforms Gurobi and PaS in real-world large-scale problems.

Conclusion: ID-PaS effectively extends Predict-and-Search to parametric MIPs and enhances performance.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MIPs) are powerful and flexible tools for modeling a wide range of real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Predict-and-Search methods operate by using a predictive model to estimate promising variable assignments and then guiding a search procedure toward high-quality solutions. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating machine learning (ML) into the Predict-and-Search framework significantly enhances its performance. Still, it is restricted to binary problems and overlooks the presence of fixed variables that commonly arise in practical settings. This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively. Experiments on several real-world large-scale problems demonstrate that ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and PaS.

*Yuxin Liu,Chaojie Gu,Yihang Zhang,Bin Qian,Shibo He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores reverse thinking methodologies to improve LLMs' performance in detecting missing information, outperforming traditional forward reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with missing information, leading to incomplete responses and errors. Forward reasoning methods like CoT and ToT fail to systematically address this issue.

Method: The paper proposes a novel framework using reverse thinking to guide LLMs in identifying necessary conditions and missing elements, turning the problem into backward reasoning.

Result: Experiments show the reverse thinking approach significantly improves accuracy over traditional forward reasoning methods.

Conclusion: Reverse thinking enhances LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness, offering a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks, yet they often struggle with problems involving missing information, exhibiting issues such as incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations. While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information. In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks. Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements. Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our reverse thinking approach achieves substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, providing a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness.

TL;DR: NAC introduces a biologically plausible continuous-time attention mechanism, improving efficiency and performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of discrete attention in continuous-time modeling by proposing a biologically inspired mechanism.

Method: Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC) uses sparse sensory gates, a backbone network, and three attention logit computation modes.

Result: NAC matches or outperforms baselines in accuracy and balances runtime and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: NAC is a viable solution for continuous-time attention, offering theoretical guarantees and practical benefits.

Abstract: Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \textit{content-target} and \textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogVision, a dataset for analyzing vision-language models (VLMs) by decomposing multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions. It identifies functional attention heads critical for multimodal reasoning and explores their universal sparsity, distribution, and hierarchical roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite VLMs' strong performance, their internal mechanisms are poorly understood. The authors aim to demystify these models by analyzing the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning.

Method: Proposes CogVision, a dataset simulating human reasoning via chain-of-thought subquestions. Uses probing to identify and characterize functional attention heads in VLMs.

Result: Functional heads are sparse, vary across functions, and mediate hierarchical interactions. Interventions show their critical role—removal degrades performance, while emphasis improves accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings illuminate VLMs' cognitive organization and suggest pathways for designing models with human-aligned reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Despite excelling on multimodal benchmarks, vision-language models (VLMs) largely remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between AI's technical capabilities and institutional accountability necessitates a governance architecture beyond ethical guidelines.

Method: The paper proposes a Control-Panel architecture integrating human input, semantic coherence, and audit mechanisms, inspired by international standards and Australia's AI Assurance initiative.

Result: The framework ensures AI systems are verifiable, transparent, reproducible, and under human control, addressing trustworthiness systematically.

Conclusion: Trustworthiness in AI can be engineered into systems through structured governance, ensuring accountability and transparency.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly assume consequential decision-making roles, a widening gap has emerged between technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the communication-performance trade-off in collaborative perception, which is limited by practical network constraints in autonomous driving systems.

Method: InfoCom introduces an information purification paradigm with three core innovations: Information-Aware Encoding, Sparse Mask Generation, and Multi-Scale Decoding.

Result: InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead significantly (440-fold and 90-fold reductions compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively).

Conclusion: InfoCom establishes a theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception, offering a practical solution for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Precise environmental perception is critical for the reliability of autonomous driving systems. While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework for GSA-VLN, improving navigation performance by integrating human interactions and a memory-bank warm-start mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GSA-VLN frameworks lack user feedback, which is valuable for realistic adaptation. The study aims to bridge this gap by incorporating human interactions for better performance.

Method: The framework integrates user feedback (navigation instructions and corrective signals) into continual learning. It uses a memory-bank warm-start mechanism to reuse environmental knowledge and mitigate cold-start issues.

Result: Experiments on GSA-R2R show the method outperforms baselines like GR-DUET, improving navigation success and efficiency. The warm-start mechanism stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robustness and generality in continual and hybrid adaptation settings, providing sustained improvement across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to navigate complex environments by following natural-language instructions. General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE) to address Marginal Path Collapse in ratio-of-densities steering for diffusion/flow models, improving stability and performance in tasks like molecular design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ratio-of-densities steering methods suffer from Marginal Path Collapse when combining heterogeneous models, limiting their reliability in tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration.

Method: The authors derive a path existence criterion to predict collapse and propose ACE, which adapts Feynman-Kac steering with time-varying exponents to ensure valid probability paths.

Result: ACE eliminates Marginal Path Collapse, enhances compositional generation, and outperforms baselines in synthetic and molecular design benchmarks.

Conclusion: ACE transforms ratio-of-densities steering into a reliable tool for controllable generation, especially with heterogeneous models.

Abstract: Inference-time steering enables pretrained diffusion/flow models to be adapted to new tasks without retraining. A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models. Our work turns ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation.

*Hang Ni,Yuzhi Wang,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP), a multi-agent LLM-based framework for adaptive urban regeneration, involving planning, living simulation, and iterative evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban regeneration needs adaptive solutions to address evolving urban challenges, leveraging LLMs for dynamic and responsive planning.

Method: The CUP framework uses LLM agents for continuous plan generation, resident behavior simulation (Living), and iterative evaluation (Judging) in a closed-loop.

Result: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in real-world datasets, enabling continuous and adaptive urban planning.

Conclusion: CUP offers a scalable, dynamic solution for urban regeneration by integrating LLMs in a cyclical planning process.

Abstract: Urban regeneration presents significant challenges within the context of urbanization, requiring adaptive approaches to tackle evolving needs. Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we propose Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP), a new paradigm that continuously generates, evaluates, and refines urban plans in a closed-loop. Specifically, our multi-agent LLM-based framework consists of three key components: (1) Planning, where LLM agents generate and refine urban plans based on contextual data; (2) Living, where agents simulate the behaviors and interactions of residents, modeling life in the urban environment; and (3) Judging, which involves evaluating plan effectiveness and providing iterative feedback for improvement. The cyclical process enables a dynamic and responsive planning approach. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as a continuous and adaptive planning process.

*Wenhan Wu,Zhili He,Huanghuang Liang,Yili Gong,Jiawei Jiang,Chuang Hu,Dazhao Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REMISVFU is a plug-and-play framework for client-level unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), addressing the inefficacy of Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) methods. It uses representation misdirection to remove a party's contribution while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-protection regulations like GDPR require the ability to remove a party's contribution from federated systems. Existing unlearning methods focus on HFL, leaving a gap for VFL.

Method: REMISVFU collapses the encoder output of the forgetting party to a random anchor on the unit sphere, severing its statistical link. The server optimizes retention and forgetting losses with orthogonal projection to avoid interference.

Result: REMISVFU reduces back-door attack success to natural class-prior levels and only sacrifices 2.5% clean accuracy, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: REMISVFU effectively enables client-level unlearning in VFL while preserving utility for remaining parties.

Abstract: Data-protection regulations such as the GDPR grant every participant in a federated system a right to be forgotten. Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

*Ziying Zhang,Quanming Yao,Yaqing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EmerFlow is a novel framework leveraging LLMs to create distinctive embeddings for emerging items in recommendations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods oversimplify recommending emerging items by ignoring their dynamic interaction accumulation over time.

Method: EmerFlow uses LLM reasoning to enrich raw features, aligns embeddings with existing models, and refines them via meta-learning.

Result: EmerFlow excels across diverse domains like movies and pharmaceuticals with limited interactions.

Conclusion: EmerFlow effectively addresses the challenge of recommending emerging items by leveraging LLMs and meta-learning.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the challenge of recommending emerging items, whose interactions gradually accumulate over time. Existing methods often overlook this dynamic process, typically assuming that emerging items have few or even no historical interactions. Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentProg addresses context overhead in mobile GUI agents by organizing interaction history as a program, improving task performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing context management techniques degrade task performance due to loss of vital semantic information.

Method: AgentProg reframes interaction history as a program with variables and control flow, integrating a global belief state mechanism for partial observability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art success rates on benchmarks, maintaining robust performance on long-horizon tasks where baselines fail.

Conclusion: AgentProg offers a principled solution for context management in mobile GUI agents, enhancing efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: The rapid development of mobile GUI agents has stimulated growing research interest in long-horizon task automation. However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation. Our system is open-sourced at https://github.com/MobileLLM/AgentProg.

### [157] [Boosting RL-Based Visual Reasoning with Selective Adversarial Entropy Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10414)
*Yang Yu,Zhuangzhuang Chen,Siqi Wang,Lanqing Li,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Selective-adversarial Entropy Intervention (SaEI) to enhance vision-language models' reasoning by improving policy entropy during RL sampling through token-selective adversarial objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based finetuning methods for VLMs overlook entropy intervention during RL sampling, limiting the diversity of responses and policy performance. SaEI aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes SaEI, combining entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) to formulate entropy as an adversarial objective and token-selective entropy computation (TsEC) to avoid distorting factual knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments show SaEI significantly improves policy exploration and reasoning capabilities on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: SaEI effectively enhances RL-based finetuning of VLMs by leveraging entropy intervention during sampling, leading to better reasoning performance.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a common choice in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities. Code will be released once the paper is accepted.

*Ezequiel Lopez-Rubio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new method to represent graphs as strings of instructions is proposed, making them compatible with deep learning models for improved processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph representations are not suitable for deep learning models, which excel in text processing. The aim is to bridge this gap.

Method: Represent the adjacency matrix of a graph as a reversible string of instructions that build it step by step, maintaining local structural patterns.

Result: The proposed representation is compact and preserves graph structure, showing promise in a preliminary computational experiment.

Conclusion: This method could enhance graph processing with deep learning models, as supported by initial favorable results.

Abstract: The representation of graphs is commonly based on the adjacency matrix concept. This formulation is the foundation of most algebraic and computational approaches to graph processing. The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step. The transformation is reversible, i.e. given a graph the string can be produced and vice versa. The proposed representation is compact and it maintains the local structural patterns of the graph. Therefore, it is envisaged that it could be useful to boost the processing of graphs by deep learning models. A tentative computational experiment is reported, with favorable results.

*Hojun Lee,Mijin Koo,Yeji Song,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAFAP is a novel method for Targeted Data Protection (TDP) in diffusion models, addressing limitations of snapshot-based approaches by aligning the entire training trajectory with adversarial perturbations, ensuring persistent control over transformations while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns over unauthorized data usage and privacy infringement in text-to-image models, current protection methods degrade quality passively and lack stability. TAFAP aims to provide active redirection toward user-specified concepts with better controllability.

Method: TAFAP uses trajectory alignment via fine-tuning with adversarial perturbations, inspired by dataset distillation, to enforce persistent transformations throughout training, unlike snapshot-matching methods.

Result: TAFAP achieves robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality, outperforming existing TDP attempts with verifiable safeguards.

Conclusion: TAFAP provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs, enabling effective TDP with persistent control.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have made fine-tuning text-to-image models for personalization increasingly accessible, but have also raised significant concerns regarding unauthorized data usage and privacy infringement. Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs.

TL;DR: Study explores how adversarial PDF manipulation can exploit LLM-based peer review systems, introducing WAVS to measure vulnerability and finding obfuscation tactics like 'Maximum Mark Magyk' effective in flipping decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs in peer review, both informally by reviewers and formally by institutions, raises concerns about system robustness to adversarial attacks aimed at altering review outcomes.

Method: Curated 200 papers, adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies, and tested them on 13 LLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Claude Haiku) using the novel WAVS metric to evaluate vulnerability.

Result: Obfuscation strategies, especially 'Maximum Mark Magyk,' proved effective in manipulating scores, achieving high decision-flip rates across models.

Conclusion: LLM-based review systems are vulnerable to adversarial PDF manipulation, highlighting the need for safeguards. Dataset and framework will be released for further research.

Abstract: The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the "Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications in Procedural Content Generation (PCG), enabling better control over algorithmic world creation without requiring model training.

Method: The system pairs an Actor agent (for parameter configuration) with a Critic agent (for refinement), creating an iterative workflow to align configurations with human design preferences.

Result: The approach outperforms single-agent baselines, successfully generating diverse and structurally valid 3D maps from natural language descriptions, setting a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG.

Conclusion: Off-the-shelf LLMs can be repurposed as generalized agents for PCG tools, offering a scalable, training-free framework for mastering complex software.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) offers scalable methods for algorithmically creating complex, customizable worlds. However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents InternGeometry, an LLM agent achieving medalist-level performance in solving IMO geometry problems with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the heuristic limitations of existing AI models in geometry by leveraging LLM capabilities and symbolic verification.

Method: Uses iterative propositioning, symbolic verification, dynamic memory, and Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL) for efficient training.

Result: Solves 44/50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), surpassing the average gold medalist score, using only 13K training examples.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LLM agents' potential in expert-level geometry tasks with novel auxiliary constructions and minimal data.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems. However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.

TL;DR: ReMe framework enhances LLM agents via dynamic memory, outperforming larger models with self-evolving memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of static memory in LLM agents to enable dynamic reasoning and lifelong learning.

Method: Introduces multi-faceted distillation, context-adaptive reuse, and utility-based refinement for memory lifecycle management.

Result: ReMe outperforms larger memoryless models, showing a memory-scaling effect and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ReMe provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning, with released code and dataset for research.

Abstract: Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize "how-to" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a "passive accumulation" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.

TL;DR: NormCode is a semiformal language designed to prevent context pollution in multistep LLM workflows by enforcing data isolation and separating semantic from syntactic operations, validated through accurate algorithm execution and self-hosted compiler pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of context pollution in multistep LLM workflows, where models hallucinate or lose track of constraints due to accumulating intermediate information.

Method: Introduces NormCode, a language with three formats (.ncds, .ncd, .ncn) for human authoring, machine execution, and verification, enforcing data isolation and separating semantic (LLM-driven) and syntactic (deterministic) operations.

Result: Validated by a 100% accurate base X addition algorithm and self-hosting NormCode's compiler pipeline, demonstrating reliable execution and transparency in AI workflows.

Conclusion: NormCode effectively eliminates cross-step contamination, enabling auditable and transparent AI workflows, crucial for high-stakes domains like legal, medical, and financial applications.

Abstract: Multistep workflows that chain large language model (LLM) calls suffer from context pollution: as information accumulates across steps, models hallucinate, confuse intermediate outputs, and lose track of task constraints. We present NormCode, a semiformal language for constructing plans of inferences, structured decompositions where each step operates in data isolation and receives only explicitly passed inputs, which eliminates crossstep contamination by design. NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing. The language exists in three isomorphic formats: .ncds for human authoring, .ncd for machine execution, and .ncn for human verification, supporting progressive formalization from sketch to production. We validate NormCode through two demonstrations: (1) a base X addition algorithm achieving 100 percent accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self hosted execution of NormCode's own five phase compiler pipeline. The working orchestrator provides dependency driven scheduling, SQLite backed checkpointing, and loop management, making AI workflows auditable by design and addressing a critical need for transparency in high stakes domains such as legal reasoning, medical decision making, and financial analysis.

*Moshe Lahmy,Roi Yozevitch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAL-RAG improves multi-hop query performance by replacing distractors with relevant evidence instead of expanding context, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems struggle with multi-hop queries due to missed bridge facts and context dilution from expanded retrievals.

Method: SEAL-RAG uses a 'replace, don't expand' strategy with a Search → Extract → Assess → Loop cycle and entity-first ranking.

Result: SEAL-RAG significantly improves answer correctness and evidence precision on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA.

Conclusion: SEAL-RAG effectively mitigates context dilution while maintaining predictable costs and high precision.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.

TL;DR: Phythesis combines LLMs and physics-guided optimization to automate energy-efficient data center design, outperforming vanilla LLM solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DC design methods struggle with complexity, and existing AI approaches ignore physics, making them unsuitable for quantifiable objectives.

Method: Phythesis uses a bi-level optimization: LLMs refine layouts, and physics-informed optimization selects optimal asset parameters.

Result: Phythesis improves generation success by 57.3% and reduces PUE by 11.5% compared to vanilla LLM solutions.

Conclusion: Phythesis effectively bridges the gap between AI-driven design and physics constraints, enhancing DC efficiency.

Abstract: Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.

TL;DR: scRCL is a novel framework for unsupervised cell type identification that incorporates cell-gene interactions to improve clustering accuracy by refining representations through contrastive learning and gene-correlation structure learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clustering methods for single-cell omics studies focus primarily on intrinsic cellular structures and ignore cell-gene associations, limiting their ability to distinguish closely related cell types.

Method: The proposed scRCL framework includes two contrastive distribution alignment components to exploit cell-cell structural relationships and a refinement module integrating gene-correlation structure learning to capture cell-gene associations.

Result: scRCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy on single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets and recovers cell populations with coherent gene-expression signatures.

Conclusion: scRCL enhances unsupervised cell type identification by leveraging cell-gene interactions, demonstrating biological relevance and improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised cell type identification is crucial for uncovering and characterizing heterogeneous populations in single cell omics studies. Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach.

*Tong Zhang,Carlos Hinojosa,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAPTAIN is a training-free framework that mitigates memorization in diffusion models by modifying latent features during denoising, achieving better results than existing methods while preserving prompt alignment and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns. Existing methods often struggle to balance memorization reduction with prompt alignment.

Method: CAPTAIN uses frequency-based noise initialization, identifies optimal denoising timesteps, localizes memorized regions, and injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images.

Result: CAPTAIN significantly reduces memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.

Conclusion: CAPTAIN offers an effective solution to mitigate memorization in diffusion models without compromising prompt fidelity or visual quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns as these systems are increasingly deployed at scale. Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.

### [169] [On the Dynamics of Multi-Agent LLM Communities Driven by Value Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10665)
*Muhua Huang,Qinlin Zhao,Xiaoyuan Yi,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diversity of values in LLM-based multi-agent systems enhances stability and creativity but has diminishing returns at extreme heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how value diversity shapes collective behavior in AI communities.

Method: Used Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values to simulate multi-agent interactions and constitution formation.

Result: Value diversity boosts stability and creativity but causes instability at extreme levels.

Conclusion: Value diversity is a key factor linking AI capabilities to sociological insights on institutional emergence.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLM) based multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, the collective behaviors, e.g., collective intelligence, of such artificial communities have drawn growing attention. This work aims to answer a fundamental question: How does diversity of values shape the collective behavior of AI communities? Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability. This work positions value diversity as a new axis of future AI capability, bridging AI ability and sociological studies of institutional emergence.

### [170] [AEBNAS: Strengthening Exit Branches in Early-Exit Networks through Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10671)
*Oscar Robben,Saeed Khalilian,Nirvana Meratnia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hardware-aware NAS framework for designing efficient early-exit networks, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce energy consumption and latency in deep learning models by optimizing exit-branch placement and design.

Method: Use hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to enhance exit branches, considering depth, layer types, and adaptive thresholds.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy with similar or lower computational cost (MACs) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in designing efficient and accurate early-exit networks.

Abstract: Early-exit networks are effective solutions for reducing the overall energy consumption and latency of deep learning models by adjusting computation based on the complexity of input data. By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

### [171] [Challenges of Evaluating LLM Safety for User Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10687)
*Manon Kempermann,Sai Suresh Macharla Vasu,Mahalakshmi Raveenthiran,Theo Farrell,Ingmar Weber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the limitations of universal risk frameworks in evaluating LLM safety for individual welfare, especially in high-stakes contexts like finance and health. It shows that context-aware evaluations are crucial, as context-blind assessments overestimate safety, and realistic user disclosures alone don't bridge the gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety evaluations focus on universal risks, neglecting context-dependent harms for individual users, particularly vulnerable ones in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: The study evaluates LLM advice (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) across diverse user profiles, comparing context-blind and context-aware assessments and testing prompts with disclosed user context.

Result: Context-blind evaluators rated responses safer (5/7) than context-aware ones (3/7). Realistic user disclosures didn't improve safety scores, highlighting the need for diverse profile evaluations.

Conclusion: Effective LLM safety evaluations must incorporate diverse user contexts, as universal frameworks and realistic disclosures alone fail to assess individual welfare risks adequately.

Abstract: Safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) typically focus on universal risks like dangerous capabilities or undesirable propensities. However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks. We publish our code and dataset to aid future developments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RadVLM integrates RL with SFT for improved CXR interpretation, showing RL's benefits over SFT alone, while explicit reasoning ('thinking') adds no extra gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs often rely only on SFT, which lacks answer quality evaluation, whereas RL with task-specific feedback could enhance performance.

Method: Large-scale SFT on CXR data builds RadVLM, followed by GRPO-based RL with clinical rewards for report generation and grounding.

Result: RL boosts performance beyond SFT, but explicit reasoning doesn't help. RadVLM with RL outperforms baselines, achieving SOTA in report generation and grounding.

Conclusion: Clinically aligned RL complements SFT effectively for medical VLMs, though explicit reasoning may not be necessary.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in multiple aspects. However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CA-GPT, a domain-specific AI model, outperformed general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians in OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment, showing higher agreement with expert-derived decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the operator-dependent limitations of intravascular imaging interpretation and evaluate the reliability of a domain-specific AI model (CA-GPT) compared to general-purpose AI and junior physicians.

Method: Single-center analysis of 96 patients undergoing OCT-guided PCI, comparing procedural decisions from CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians against expert records using ten pre-specified metrics.

Result: CA-GPT showed significantly higher agreement scores than ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians in both pre-PCI planning and post-PCI assessment, with notable advantages in stent selection and complex scenarios.

Conclusion: CA-GPT provides a standardized, reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, potentially enhancing operator expertise and optimizing OCT-guided PCI outcomes.

Abstract: Background: While intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT), improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.
  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.
  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.
  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases. This approach provides a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.

*Wang Lu,Yao Zhu,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAROOD, a benchmark for evaluating Out-of-Distribution (OOD) algorithms in Human Activity Recognition (HAR), covering diverse scenarios (cross-person, etc.), datasets, and methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD algorithms lack comprehensive evaluation in HAR settings. The paper aims to fill this gap by systematically assessing their effectiveness.

Method: HAROOD defines 4 OOD scenarios, tests 16 methods on 6 datasets, and uses CNN and Transformer architectures.

Result: No single OOD method consistently outperforms others, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: HAROOD provides a modular framework for advancing OOD research in HAR, encouraging further development.

Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR. Our implementation is released and can be found at https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/HAROOD.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework called 'Agile Deliberation' supports users in refining vague visual concepts iteratively, achieving higher accuracy and clarity compared to automated or manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-in-the-loop approaches assume users have clear, stable concepts, but in reality, users often start with vague ideas and need iterative refinement.

Method: Agile Deliberation involves two stages: (1) concept scoping to decompose the concept into sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration to refine the classifier using borderline examples.

Result: The framework achieved 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated baselines and over 3% higher than manual deliberation, with users reporting clearer understanding and less cognitive effort.

Conclusion: Agile Deliberation effectively supports evolving and subjective concepts, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and user experience.

Abstract: From content moderation to content curation, applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts are rapidly expanding. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through "concept deliberation", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called "Agile Deliberation" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.

### [176] [V-OCBF: Learning Safety Filters from Offline Data via Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10822)
*Mumuksh Tayal,Manan Tayal,Aditya Singh,Shishir Kolathaya,Ravi Prakash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V-OCBF is a framework that learns neural Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) from offline data without needing system dynamics, ensuring safety in autonomous systems with fewer violations than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Safe Offline RL methods lack guarantees for forward invariance, while CBFs require expert design or full system knowledge. V-OCBF aims to bridge this gap by learning CBFs offline without dynamics models.

Method: V-OCBF learns a neural CBF from offline data using a recursive finite-difference barrier update and an expectile-based objective, avoiding out-of-distribution actions. A QP formulation synthesizes safe control in real-time.

Result: V-OCBF significantly reduces safety violations compared to baselines while maintaining task performance, demonstrating scalability for offline safety-critical control.

Conclusion: V-OCBF provides a model-free, scalable solution for offline safety-critical control, eliminating the need for online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous systems requires controllers that satisfy hard, state-wise constraints without relying on online interaction. While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.

*Fuyan Ou,Siqi Ai,Yulin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGC-Herd is a training-free condensation framework for large-scale heterogeneous graphs that reduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing scalability challenges in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional features.

Method: Uses lightweight feature propagation and class-wise herding to create compact, informative graphs.

Result: Achieves comparable or better accuracy than full-graph training with reduced runtime and memory use.

Conclusion: HGC-Herd offers practical efficiency for scalable heterogeneous graph learning.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have demonstrated strong capability in modeling complex semantics across multi-type nodes and relations. However, their scalability to large-scale graphs remains challenging due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional node features. Existing graph condensation approaches, such as GCond, are primarily developed for homogeneous graphs and rely on gradient matching, resulting in considerable computational, memory, and optimization overhead. We propose HGC-Herd, a training-free condensation framework that generates compact yet informative heterogeneous graphs while maintaining both semantic and structural fidelity. HGC-Herd integrates lightweight feature propagation to encode multi-hop relational context and employs a class-wise herding mechanism to identify representative nodes per class, producing balanced and discriminative subsets for downstream learning tasks. Extensive experiments on ACM, DBLP, and Freebase validate that HGC-Herd attains comparable or superior accuracy to full-graph training while markedly reducing both runtime and memory consumption. These results underscore its practical value for efficient and scalable heterogeneous graph representation learning.

*Kesheng Chen,Wenjian Luo,Zhenqian Zhu,Yamin Hu,Yiya Xi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAMBO is a framework that efficiently constructs the Pareto set for LLMs by balancing granularity and dimensionality through hybrid block-wise optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Pareto set construction in LLMs are either too coarse or computationally infeasible due to high dimensionality.

Method: BAMBO uses a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy (formulated as 1D clustering) and an evolutionary loop with qEHVI to automate Pareto set construction.

Result: BAMBO outperforms baselines, providing a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier for flexible model selection.

Conclusion: BAMBO effectively addresses the trade-offs in LLM efficiency and capability, enabling practical application under diverse constraints.

Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

*Marvin Alles,Xingyuan Zhang,Patrick van der Smagt,Philip Becker-Ehmck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces latent-action world models that combine action-conditioned and action-free data for more efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans learn from both direct interaction and passive observation, but standard world models rely heavily on action-conditioned data, which is often scarce.

Method: The proposed latent-action world models learn a shared latent action representation, aligning control signals with inferred actions from passive data.

Result: The approach achieves strong performance on the DeepMind Control Suite with significantly fewer action-labeled samples than baselines.

Conclusion: Latent actions enable training on heterogeneous data, improving world model efficiency by bridging offline RL and action-free learning.

Abstract: Inspired by how humans combine direct interaction with action-free experience (e.g., videos), we study world models that learn from heterogeneous data. Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework for causal discovery, proposing two modified algorithms (Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI) that outperform baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods struggle with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies, motivating the use of prior knowledge (Cluster-DAGs) to improve performance.

Method: The authors propose two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC for fully observed settings and Cluster-FCI for partially observed settings, leveraging Cluster-DAGs as a warm-start.

Result: Empirical evaluation on simulated data shows that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform baseline methods without prior knowledge.

Conclusion: Cluster-DAGs provide a flexible prior knowledge framework, enhancing causal discovery performance in both fully and partially observed settings.

Abstract: Finding cause-effect relationships is of key importance in science. Causal discovery aims to recover a graph from data that succinctly describes these cause-effect relationships. However, current methods face several challenges, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. Incorporating prior knowledge about the system can aid causal discovery. In this work, we leverage Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework to warm-start causal discovery. We show that Cluster-DAGs offer greater flexibility than existing approaches based on tiered background knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI, for causal discovery in the fully and partially observed setting, respectively. Empirical evaluation on simulated data demonstrates that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform their respective baselines without prior knowledge.

*Sarwan Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HB-SGE is a robust first-order optimization method combining heavy-ball momentum with gradient prediction, offering stable convergence on ill-conditioned or non-convex problems where traditional methods like NAG fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional accelerated methods like NAG diverge on ill-conditioned or non-convex landscapes due to aggressive momentum. HB-SGE aims to provide adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability.

Method: HB-SGE integrates heavy-ball momentum with local Taylor approximations to predict future gradients, avoiding historical gradient accumulation.

Result: HB-SGE converges on ill-conditioned quadratics (119 iterations) and non-convex Rosenbrock (2,718 iterations), outperforming NAG and SGD, which diverge.

Conclusion: HB-SGE offers robust performance across diverse landscapes with minimal overhead, though NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems.

Abstract: Accelerated gradient methods like Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) achieve faster convergence on well-conditioned problems but often diverge on ill-conditioned or non-convex landscapes due to aggressive momentum accumulation. We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $κ=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps. While NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems, HB-SGE provides a robust alternative with speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, requiring only $O(d)$ memory overhead and the same hyperparameters as standard momentum.

*Skyler Wu,Aymen Echarghaoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MRPO improves DPO by using multiple reference models, but current weighting methods are unreliable. Four new strategies outperform existing methods, but single-reference DPO often works better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability and performance of fine-tuning LLMs by addressing the ad-hoc and unsound weighting methods in MRPO.

Method: Introduces four new weighting strategies: two offline methods using validation data, two online methods (sliding-window and bandit-based). Tests on Qwen2.5-0.5B and seven reference models.

Result: New strategies outperform current MRPO methods in preference accuracy. However, single-reference DPO often outperforms multiple-reference approaches.

Conclusion: While new weighting strategies improve MRPO, single-reference DPO remains more effective in practice, questioning the value of multiple-reference approaches.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is integral for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy. More thought-provokingly, however, we find that single-reference DPO, using any of 6 out of 7 references, consistently outperforms all tested multiple-reference approaches -- calling into question the practical appeal of multiple-reference approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn a prior policy for downstream tasks without task-specific rewards by maximizing state entropy.

Method: Introduces SEMDICE, optimizing policy directly within stationary distributions using an off-policy dataset.

Result: Outperforms baselines in state entropy maximization and adaptation efficiency.

Conclusion: SEMDICE is effective for unsupervised RL pre-training and downstream task adaptation.

Abstract: In the unsupervised pre-training for reinforcement learning, the agent aims to learn a prior policy for downstream tasks without relying on task-specific reward functions. We focus on state entropy maximization (SEM), where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the entropy of the state stationary distribution. In this paper, we introduce SEMDICE, a principled off-policy algorithm that computes an SEM policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset, which optimizes the policy directly within the space of stationary distributions. SEMDICE computes a single, stationary Markov state-entropy-maximizing policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMDICE outperforms baseline algorithms in maximizing state entropy while achieving the best adaptation efficiency for downstream tasks among SEM-based unsupervised RL pre-training methods.

TL;DR: DEFCON is a framework using Graph Attention Networks to quantify soccer defenders' impact by analyzing attacking situations, assigning credits based on EPV changes, and showing correlations with market values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on visible defensive actions, missing the broader impact of defenders in preventing attacks. DEFCON aims to fill this gap.

Method: Uses Graph Attention Networks to assess attacking options and defenders' roles, calculating EPV changes to assign defensive credits.

Result: DEFCON's player credits correlate strongly with market valuations and provide detailed insights like in-game defensive timelines.

Conclusion: DEFCON offers a comprehensive tool for evaluating defensive contributions in soccer, with practical applications for analysis.

Abstract: Evaluating defensive performance in soccer remains challenging, as effective defending is often expressed not through visible on-ball actions such as interceptions and tackles, but through preventing dangerous opportunities before they arise. Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV. Trained on 2023-24 and evaluated on 2024-25 Eredivisie event and tracking data, DEFCON's aggregated player credits exhibit strong positive correlations with market valuations. Finally, we showcase several practical applications, including in-game timelines of defensive contributions, spatial analyses across pitch zones, and pairwise summaries of attacker-defender interactions.

*João Lucas Luz Lima Sarcinelli,Diego Furtado Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using locally run LLMs, outperforming individual models in Portuguese NER tasks with minimal annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs under-perform in NER for lower-resource languages like Portuguese, and existing ensembles overlook NER, prompting a focused solution.

Method: Novel three-step ensemble pipeline combining similarly capable LLMs, leveraging heuristics for optimal model selection with minimal annotated data.

Result: Outperforms individual LLMs in 4/5 Portuguese NER datasets; ensembles from different source datasets also excel cross-dataset.

Conclusion: Advances scalable, low-resource zero-shot NER by combining small LLMs without fine-tuning, reducing reliance on annotated data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks through in-context learning but often under-perform in Named Entity Recognition (NER), especially for lower-resource languages like Portuguese. While open-weight LLMs enable local deployment, no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches. However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task. Our work advances scalable, low-resource, and zero-shot NER by effectively combining multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/Joao-Luz/local-llm-ner-ensemble.

*Zhuo-Yang Song,Qing-Hong Cao,Ming-xing Luo,Hua Xing Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework using the least action principle to understand the generative dynamics of LLMs in agents, discovering a detailed balance in transitions and suggesting LLMs learn potential functions rather than rule sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the macroscopic dynamics of LLM-driven agents, moving from empirical practices to a predictable science.

Method: Uses the least action principle to estimate generative directionality and measures transition probabilities between LLM-generated states.

Result: Identifies detailed balance in transitions, indicating LLMs learn underlying potential functions, a discovery independent of specific model details.

Conclusion: Establishes a step towards a macroscopic dynamics theory for AI systems, aiming to quantify and predict LLM agent behaviors.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face scalability issues due to quadratic complexity; DB2-TransF aims to address this while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Replaces self-attention with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer to capture multi-scale patterns efficiently.

Result: Outperforms or matches Transformers in accuracy while reducing memory usage, tested on 13 benchmarks.

Conclusion: DB2-TransF offers a scalable and efficient alternative for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires models that can efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional settings. While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoTra improves autoregressive forecasting in clinical settings by using soft tokens to reduce exposure bias and risk-aware decoding to minimize harm, showing significant risk reduction in glucose and blood-pressure forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address exposure bias in autoregressive forecasting for clinical applications, where unstable multi-step forecasts can lead to safety risks in closed-loop control.

Method: The method involves Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra), which propagates continuous probability distributions (soft tokens) to mitigate exposure bias and incorporates a risk-aware decoding module.

Result: SoTra reduces average zone-based risk by 18% in glucose forecasting and lowers effective clinical risk by ~15% in blood-pressure forecasting.

Conclusion: SoTra is effective for safety-critical predictive control in clinical settings, demonstrating significant improvements in risk reduction.

Abstract: Autoregressive forecasting is central to predictive control in diabetes and hemodynamic management, where different operating zones carry different clinical risks. Standard models trained with teacher forcing suffer from exposure bias, yielding unstable multi-step forecasts for closed-loop use. We introduce Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra), which propagates continuous probability distributions (``soft tokens'') to mitigate exposure bias and learn calibrated, uncertainty-aware trajectories. A risk-aware decoding module then minimizes expected clinical harm. In glucose forecasting, SoTra reduces average zone-based risk by 18\%; in blood-pressure forecasting, it lowers effective clinical risk by approximately 15\%. These improvements support its use in safety-critical predictive control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective zero-shot classifiers but are computationally expensive and environmentally costly for large-scale annotation.

Method: Text2Graph modularly integrates LLM-based partial annotation with GNN label propagation, allowing flexible swapping of components like feature extractors and sampling strategies.

Result: Benchmarked on five datasets for topic classification and sentiment analysis, Text2Graph achieves competitive results with lower energy and environmental costs compared to other zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: Text2Graph offers a sustainable alternative for large-scale text classification, balancing performance with reduced computational and environmental impacts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become effective zero-shot classifiers, but their high computational requirements and environmental costs limit their practicality for large-scale annotation in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. To support more sustainable workflows, we present \textsc{Text2Graph}, an open-source Python package that provides a modular implementation of existing text-to-graph classification approaches. The framework enables users to combine LLM-based partial annotation with Graph Neural Network (GNN) label propagation in a flexible manner, making it straightforward to swap components such as feature extractors, edge construction methods, and sampling strategies. We benchmark \textsc{Text2Graph} on a zero-shot setting using five datasets spanning topic classification and sentiment analysis tasks, comparing multiple variants against other zero-shot approaches for text classification. In addition to reporting performance, we provide detailed estimates of energy consumption and carbon emissions, showing that graph-based propagation achieves competitive results at a fraction of the energy and environmental cost.

TL;DR: MedXAI is an explainable framework for medical imaging that integrates deep learning with clinician knowledge to improve accuracy, reduce bias, and provide transparent diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in medical AI like domain shifts, rare-class bias, and lack of transparency for clinical safety.

Method: Combines deep vision models with clinician-derived expert knowledge, localizes diagnostic features, and avoids post-hoc explainability methods.

Result: Achieves 3% better cross-domain generalization and 10% higher F1 score for rare classes, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: MedXAI enhances robustness and provides clinically aligned explanations, especially for rare diseases in medical AI.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a fundamental challenge in medical AI, particularly un- der domain shifts and rare-class conditions. Deep learning mod- els often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Med- ical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician- derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare- class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines. Ablations confirm that the symbolic components act as effective clinical priors and regularizers, improving robustness under distribution shift. MedXAI delivers clinically aligned explanations while achieving superior in-domain and cross-domain performance, particularly for rare diseases in multimodal medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CHyLL learns continuous neural representations of hybrid systems without traditional segmentation or mode switching, improving accuracy and identifying topological invariants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid systems with continuous and discrete dynamics face challenges in accurately learning flows due to mode switching and discontinuities.

Method: CHyLL leverages a piecewise smooth quotient manifold and neural embedding in higher-dimensional space to learn continuous flows without segmentation or mode switching.

Result: CHyLL achieves superior accuracy in predicting hybrid system flows and identifies topological invariants, proven in stochastic optimal control applications.

Conclusion: CHyLL offers an effective, continuous neural representation method for hybrid systems, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Learning the flows of hybrid systems that have both continuous and discrete time dynamics is challenging. The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.

TL;DR: A new discrete entropy estimator is introduced to address bias in small data sets, outperforming classical methods in undersampled regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable entropy estimation from small data sets is crucial but challenging due to negative bias from missing mass and unseen outcomes.

Method: Uses decomposability property along with estimations of missing mass and unseen outcomes to correct bias.

Result: Outperforms classical estimators in undersampled regimes and matches state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves entropy estimation for small data sets.

Abstract: Reliable data-driven estimation of Shannon entropy from small data sets, where the number of examples is potentially smaller than the number of possible outcomes, is a critical matter in several applications. In this paper, we introduce a discrete entropy estimator, where we use the decomposability property in combination with estimations of the missing mass and the number of unseen outcomes to compensate for the negative bias induced by them. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms some classical estimators in undersampled regimes, and performs comparably with some well-established state-of-the-art estimators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with sparsity and computational complexity, while deep learning models often fail on tabular biological data, prompting the need for a novel topological approach.

Method: Combines Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with Rips complex construction to map sequences to 2D coordinates, compute distances, and capture structural/topological features.

Result: Achieves 86.8% accuracy on breast cancer and 94.5% on lung cancer datasets, outperforming vector-based, sequence language, and image-based methods.

Conclusion: The topological approach effectively preserves sequence information and leverages vision-based deep learning for superior molecular sequence analysis.

Abstract: Traditional feature engineering approaches for molecular sequence classification suffer from sparsity issues and computational complexity, while deep learning models often underperform on tabular biological data. This paper introduces a novel topological approach that transforms molecular sequences into images by combining Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with Rips complex construction from algebraic topology. Our method maps sequence elements to 2D coordinates via CGR, computes pairwise distances, and constructs Rips complexes to capture both local structural and global topological features. We provide formal guarantees on representation uniqueness, topological stability, and information preservation. Extensive experiments on anticancer peptide datasets demonstrate superior performance over vector-based, sequence language models, and existing image-based methods, achieving 86.8\% and 94.5\% accuracy on breast and lung cancer datasets, respectively. The topological representation preserves critical sequence information while enabling effective utilization of vision-based deep learning architectures for molecular sequence analysis.

TL;DR: A scalable embedding method for SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences is introduced, improving efficiency and accuracy for large-scale lineage classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection and characterization of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are critical. Existing methods for analyzing viral sequence data are computationally intensive or inefficient for large datasets.

Method: A scalable embedding method using hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences, followed by training machine learning models for lineage classification.

Result: The method achieves up to 86.4% classification accuracy and reduces embedding generation time by 99.81%, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a fast, effective, and scalable solution for large-scale viral sequence analysis, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Early detection and characterization of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, remain critical for effective clinical response and public-health planning. The global availability of large-scale viral sequence data presents significant opportunities for computational analysis; however, existing approaches face notable limitations. Phylogenetic tree-based methods are computationally intensive and do not scale efficiently to today's multi-million-sequence datasets. Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\%. This highlights the method's potential as a fast, effective, and scalable solution for large-scale viral sequence analysis.

*Tiago Brogueira,Mário Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reframes the i.i.d. setting in causal discovery using exchangeability, arguing it's a more general principle. It presents conceptual and empirical arguments, introduces a synthetic dataset enforcing exchangeability, and shows similar performance to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize causal discovery by shifting from i.i.d. to exchangeability assumptions, aligning it more closely with real-world data and experimental causal inference.

Method: Reframes i.i.d. assumptions as exchangeability, introduces a synthetic dataset enforcing exchangeability, and develops a neural-network-based causal-discovery algorithm trained on this dataset.

Result: The exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors real-world data better than i.i.d. datasets, and the proposed algorithm performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Exchangeability is a more suitable assumption for causal discovery than i.i.d., supported by both theory and empirical results.

Abstract: Causal discovery methods have traditionally been developed under two distinct regimes: independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and timeseries data, each governed by separate modelling assumptions. In this paper, we argue that the i.i.d. setting can and should be reframed in terms of exchangeability, a strictly more general symmetry principle. We present the implications of this reframing, alongside two core arguments: (1) a conceptual argument, based on extending the dependency of experimental causal inference on exchangeability to causal discovery; and (2) an empirical argument, showing that many existing i.i.d. causal-discovery methods are predicated on exchangeability assumptions, and that the sole extensive widely-used real-world "i.i.d." benchmark (the Tübingen dataset) consists mainly of exchangeable (and not i.i.d.) examples. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that enforces only the exchangeability assumption, without imposing the stronger i.i.d. assumption. We show that our exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world "i.i.d." dataset more closely than all other i.i.d. synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive capability of this dataset by proposing a neural-network-based causal-discovery algorithm trained exclusively on our synthetic dataset, and which performs similarly to other state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the real-world benchmark.

*Keito Inoshita,Xiaokang Zhou,Akira Kawai,Katsutoshi Yada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIEGAD is a data augmentation framework addressing data scarcity and label imbalance by systematically covering semantically uncovered regions in datasets, ensuring alignment and quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of data scarcity and label imbalance in deep learning, which cause misclassification and unstable behaviors near class boundaries.

Method: CIEGAD uses cluster conditioning, hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation, interpolative and extrapolative synthesis, and geometry-constrained filtering with LLM-as-a-Judge for quality control.

Result: Experiments show CIEGAD effectively extends data distributions, maintains alignment, and improves F1 and recall in long-tailed and multi-class tasks.

Conclusion: CIEGAD is a practical data augmentation framework that enhances underrepresented regions while ensuring alignment and diversity.

Abstract: In practical deep learning deployment, the scarcity of data and the imbalance of label distributions often lead to semantically uncovered regions within the real-world data distribution, hindering model training and causing misclassification near class boundaries as well as unstable behaviors in peripheral areas. Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares a spiking neural network (SNN) and a temporal convolutional network (TCN) for decoding fingertip force from motor-unit firing derived from high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG), finding the TCN more accurate but suggesting potential improvements for the SNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of mapping neural activity to motor intent using HD-sEMG, exploring neuromorphic architectures for assistive and rehabilitation control.

Method: Data from a single participant (10 trials) were collected using forearm electrode arrays, with motor-unit activity derived via FastICA-based decomposition. Models (SNN and TCN) were trained on overlapping windows with causal convolutions.

Result: The TCN outperformed the SNN, achieving 4.44% MVC RMSE (Pearson r = 0.974) compared to the SNN's 8.25% MVC RMSE (r = 0.922).

Conclusion: While the TCN was more accurate, the SNN is considered a viable baseline with potential for improvement through architectural and hyperparameter refinements.

Abstract: High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) provides a noninvasive neural interface for assistive and rehabilitation control, but mapping neural activity to user motor intent remains challenging. We assess a spiking neural network (SNN) as a neuromorphic architecture against a temporal convolutional network (TCN) for decoding fingertip force from motor-unit (MU) firing derived from HD-sEMG. Data were collected from a single participant (10 trials) with two forearm electrode arrays; MU activity was obtained via FastICA-based decomposition, and models were trained on overlapping windows with end-to-end causal convolutions. On held-out trials, the TCN achieved 4.44% MVC RMSE (Pearson r = 0.974) while the SNN achieved 8.25% MVC (r = 0.922). While the TCN was more accurate, we view the SNN as a realistic neuromorphic baseline that could close much of this gap with modest architectural and hyperparameter refinements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the miniF2F benchmark to Dafny, an automated theorem prover, and explore the synergy between LLMs and automation.

Method: Translate miniF2F to Dafny, evaluate automated verification, and test 12 LLMs for proof hints using iterative error correction.

Result: Dafny verified 40.6%-44.7% of problems automatically; the best LLM achieved 55.7% success with hints.

Conclusion: The benchmark demonstrates effective collaboration between LLMs (high-level guidance) and automation (low-level details).

Abstract: We present miniF2F-Dafny, the first translation of the mathematical reasoning benchmark miniF2F to an automated theorem prover: Dafny. Previously, the benchmark existed only in interactive theorem provers (Lean, Isabelle, HOL Light, Metamath). We find that Dafny's automation verifies 99/244 (40.6%) of the test set and 109/244 (44.7%) of the validation set with empty proofs--requiring no manual proof steps. For problems where empty proofs fail, we evaluate 12 off-the-shelf LLMs on providing proof hints. The best model we test achieves 55.7% pass@4 success rate employing iterative error correction. These preliminary results highlight an effective division of labor: LLMs provide high-level guidance while automation handles low-level details. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub at http://github.com/dafny-lang/miniF2F .

### [199] [Exact Recovery of Non-Random Missing Multidimensional Time Series via Temporal Isometric Delay-Embedding Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10191)
*Hao Shu,Jicheng Li,Yu Jin,Ling Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method, LRTC-TIDT, to handle non-random missing data in multidimensional time series by leveraging Hankel-structured tensor completion and a novel temporal isometric delay-embedding transform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-random missing data in multidimensional time series undermines reliability, and existing methods like pure low-rank tensor completion are inadequate for such cases.

Method: The authors introduce the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform to construct a low-rank Hankel tensor, using smoothness and periodicity of time series. They develop the LRTC-TIDT model under the t-SVD framework.

Result: The model achieves exact recovery under non-random sampling conditions and outperforms existing methods in simulations and real-world tasks like network flow reconstruction and urban traffic estimation.

Conclusion: LRTC-TIDT is a robust solution for non-random missing data in multidimensional time series, with proven theoretical guarantees and superior performance.

Abstract: Non-random missing data is a ubiquitous yet undertreated flaw in multidimensional time series, fundamentally threatening the reliability of data-driven analysis and decision-making. Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoShu2000/LRTC-TIDT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDG improves generalization in federated learning while enhancing privacy through latent space inversion and an important weight aggregation strategy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy risks in federated domain generalization (FedDG) caused by sharing client data statistics and improve generalization across non-i.i.d. clients.

Method: Enforce domain invariance using latent space inversion for local training and introduce an important weight aggregation strategy for better parameter prioritization.

Result: Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods with reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed FedDG solution effectively balances privacy and generalization in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) addresses distribution shifts among clients in a federated learning framework. FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations. To overcome this, we propose an \textbf{important weight} aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence predictions of local models during aggregation. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework for multimodal time series forecasting, using text data to dynamically guide time series models, and demonstrates improved accuracy with real-world data like crude oil prices and exchange rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series forecasting methods often lack accuracy due to limited historical data. Incorporating additional modalities, like text, can enhance predictions.

Method: The AIR framework leverages text data to dynamically control how time series information is combined, alongside a text-refinement pipeline using large language models.

Result: Experiments with real-world market data show AIR significantly improves forecasting accuracy by modulating the time series model with textual inputs.

Conclusion: AIR effectively integrates text data to enhance time series forecasting, demonstrating superior performance in various tasks.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task for artificial intelligence with numerous real-world applications. Traditional approaches primarily rely on historical time series data to predict the future values. However, in practical scenarios, this is often insufficient for accurate predictions due to the limited information available. To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline. Experiment results with the real world market data such as crude oil price and exchange rates demonstrate that AIR effectively modulates the behavior of the time series model using textual inputs, significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy in various time series forecasting tasks.

*Duo Wang,Xinming Wang,Chao Wang,Xiaowei Yue,Jianguo Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process (R²-HGP) framework to address challenges in multi-source transfer learning, such as heterogeneous input spaces and negative transfer, by incorporating alignment, physical insights, and sparsity penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing multi-output Gaussian process models in transfer learning, particularly with heterogeneous input spaces, ignored physical knowledge, and potential negative transfer.

Method: Introduces a trainable prior probability mapping model for input alignment, integrates it with a multi-source transfer GP model in a CVAE framework, and adds a sparsity penalty on transfer coefficients.

Result: The R²-HGP framework demonstrates superior performance in simulations and real-world engineering cases, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed R²-HGP effectively addresses key challenges in heterogeneous transfer learning, offering a robust and adaptable solution.

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KHRONOS, a kernel-based neural surrogate model blending high-fidelity (HF) and low-fidelity (LF) data for aerodynamic predictions. It outperforms MLP, GNN, and PINN models in resource-constrained scenarios with fewer parameters and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost of aerodynamic simulations, the study aims to develop an efficient surrogate model that leverages both HF and LF data for accurate predictions.

Method: KHRONOS combines variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. It is tested against MLP, GNN, and PINN using varying HF data levels (0%, 10%, 30%) and complex geometries.

Result: KHRONOS matches the accuracy of other models but excels with fewer parameters and faster training/inference, especially in resource-limited conditions.

Conclusion: KHRONOS demonstrates a promising balance of accuracy and efficiency for multi-fidelity aerodynamic predictions, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Surrogate models provide fast alternatives to costly aerodynamic simulations and are extremely useful in design and optimization applications. This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable prescriptive framework was developed to recommend SAVR or TAVR for aortic stenosis patients, reducing 5-year mortality significantly compared to real-life practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the variability in treatment selection for aortic stenosis patients due to lack of interpretable, individualized recommendations optimizing long-term outcomes.

Method: The framework integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and Optimal Policy Trees to recommend treatments minimizing 5-year mortality, tested on data from two hospitals.

Result: Counterfactual evaluation showed a 20.3% and 13.8% reduction in 5-year mortality at Hartford and St. Vincent's, respectively, demonstrating improved outcomes and generalizability.

Conclusion: The framework provides transparent, data-driven treatment recommendations, advancing precision medicine in structural heart disease with clinically aligned decision boundaries.

Abstract: Background. Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.
  Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.
  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\% in Hartford and 13.8\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations.
  Interpretation. Our interpretable prescriptive framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that improve estimated long-term outcomes both in an internal and external cohort, while remaining clinically grounded and contributing toward a more systematic and evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a geometric framework to analyze agentic loops in semantic embedding space, distinguishing between artifact and embedding spaces, and identifies two dynamical regimes—contractive rewriting and exploratory summarize and negate—showing how prompt design controls convergence or divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometric behavior of agentic loops in large language models (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit complex dynamics), which remains poorly understood.

Method: Introduces a geometric framework treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems, calibrates cosine similarity to eliminate bias, and measures trajectories, clusters, and attractors.

Result: Identifies two fundamental regimes: contractive rewriting loops converge to stable attractors, while exploratory summarize and negate loops diverge unboundedly.

Conclusion: Prompt design governs the dynamical regime of agentic loops, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence, and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.

Abstract: Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems.
  We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors.
  Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion.
  Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.

*Vijay Prakash S*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Approximates magnetization nonlinearity using continued fraction of straight lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model the nonlinear magnetization behavior in ferromagnetic substances.

Method: Uses continued fraction of straight lines for approximation and nonlinear regression.

Result: Provides a fit to interpret nonlinear behavior in magnetic domains.

Conclusion: The algebraic expression effectively estimates parameters for magnetization nonlinearity.

Abstract: Magnetization of a ferromagnetic substance in response to an externally applied magnetic field increases with the strength of the field. This is because at the microscopic level, magnetic moments in certain regions or domains of the substance increasingly align with the applied field, while the amount of misaligned domains decreases. The alignment of such magnetic domains with an applied magnetic field forms the physical basis for the nonlinearity of magnetization. In this paper, the nonlinear function is approximated as a combination of continued fraction of straight lines. The resulting fit is used to interpret the nonlinear behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains. The continued fraction of straight lines used here is an algebraic expression which can be used to estimate parameters using nonlinear regression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of backdoor attacks in DNNs, identifies sparse decision boundaries as a vulnerability, and proposes Eminence, a stealthy and robust black-box backdoor framework with minimal poison rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of theoretical understanding of backdoor attacks in DNNs limits predictability and adaptability. The paper aims to bridge this gap by analyzing how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation.

Method: The authors derive a closed-form ambiguous boundary region where minimal relabeled samples cause significant misclassification. They use influence function analysis to quantify parameter shifts and propose Eminence, a framework that optimizes subtle triggers exploiting these boundaries.

Result: Eminence achieves a > 90% attack success rate with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%), minimal clean-accuracy loss, and high transferability across models and datasets.

Conclusion: The paper rigorously connects margin poisoning to adversarial boundary manipulation, providing theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness for backdoor attacks, as demonstrated by Eminence.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) underpin critical applications yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, typically reliant on heuristic brute-force methods. Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified theoretical framework for neural training dynamics, deriving a spectral transport-dissipation PDE from gradient descent and explaining phenomena like double descent and representation drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to rigorously describe the complex dynamics of modern deep networks, particularly how Jacobian-induced operators behave under training, and to connect these dynamics to observed phenomena like spectral heavy tails and basis drift.

Method: The authors use Kato perturbation theory to derive a system of coupled mode ODEs from gradient descent, then coarse-grain it into a spectral transport-dissipation PDE. They analyze this PDE to understand spectral transport, dissipation, and coupling.

Result: The analysis reveals self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation, explaining scaling laws and the geometry of double descent. It also shows that effective training time scales as $τ(t)=t^αL(t)$.

Conclusion: The framework unifies lazy (NTK) training and feature learning as limits of the same PDE, highlighting the connection between operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and deep network scaling behavior.

Abstract: Modern deep networks operate in a rough, finite-regularity regime where Jacobian-induced operators exhibit heavy-tailed spectra and strong basis drift. In this work, we derive a unified operator-theoretoretic description of neural training dynamics directly from gradient descent. Starting from the exact evolution $\dot e_t = -M(t)e_t$ in function space, we apply Kato perturbation theory to obtain a rigorous system of coupled mode ODEs and show that, after coarse-graining, these dynamics converge to a spectral transport--dissipation PDE \[ \partial_t g + \partial_λ(v g) = -λg + S, \] where $v$ captures eigenbasis drift and $S$ encodes nonlocal spectral coupling.
  We prove that neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing the drift to take an asymptotic power-law form $v(λ,t)\sim -c(t)λ^b$. In the weak-coupling regime -- naturally induced by spectral locality and SGD noise -- the PDE admits self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation. This structure yields explicit scaling-law exponents, explains the geometry of double descent, and shows that the effective training time satisfies $τ(t)=t^αL(t)$ for slowly varying $L$.
  Finally, we show that NTK training and feature learning arise as two limits of the same PDE: $v\equiv 0$ recovers lazy dynamics, while $v\neq 0$ produces representation drift. Our results provide a unified spectral framework connecting operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and the universal scaling behavior of modern deep networks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for evaluating AI metacognition using a psychologically-grounded measure (meta-d') to improve model selection and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address poor calibration in deep learning models by leveraging metacognition, inspired by human cognitive science, to better assess model confidence and competence.

Method: Introduces meta-d' as a measure of metacognitive sensitivity and uses it in a bandit-based arbiter for dynamic model selection among expert models.

Result: Experiments show the metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy across various datasets and model combinations.

Conclusion: The framework recasts ensemble selection as evaluating both short-term signals and medium-term traits, offering a novel behavioral account of AI models.

Abstract: A key aspect of human cognition is metacognition - the ability to assess one's own knowledge and judgment reliability. While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).

TL;DR: A Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for accurate, uncertainty-aware water flux prediction in Forward Osmosis (FO) outperforms traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FO models have limitations in empirical parameter variability and lack physical consistency, while purely data-driven models lack uncertainty quantification (UQ).

Method: The hybrid framework trains GPR on residual errors between FO physical model predictions and experimental data, incorporating full UQ by decomposing predictive variance into model and input uncertainties.

Result: The model, trained on 120 data points, achieved a MAPE of 0.26% and R2 of 0.999, showing high accuracy and reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust and reliable surrogate model for FO process optimization and digital twin development.

Abstract: Forward Osmosis (FO) is a promising low-energy membrane separation technology, but challenges in accurately modelling its water flux (Jw) persist due to complex internal mass transfer phenomena. Traditional mechanistic models struggle with empirical parameter variability, while purely data-driven models lack physical consistency and rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ). This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual). Crucially, we implement a full UQ methodology by decomposing the total predictive variance (sigma2_total) into model uncertainty (epistemic, from GPR's posterior variance) and input uncertainty (aleatoric, analytically propagated via the Delta method for multi-variate correlated inputs). Leveraging the inherent strength of GPR in low-data regimes, the model, trained on a meagre 120 data points, achieved a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on the independent test data, validating a truly robust and reliable surrogate model for advanced FO process optimization and digital twin development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constraint satisfaction methods struggle with efficiency-applicability trade-offs, especially in safety-critical applications like power systems and autonomous driving. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes T-SKM-Net, which transforms constraints into pure inequalities using null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back efficiently.

Result: Achieves 4.27ms/item GPU inference with minimal optimality gaps and zero constraint violations, outperforming traditional solvers like pandapower by 25x.

Conclusion: T-SKM-Net successfully integrates SKM into neural networks, offering scalable, efficient, and theoretically sound constraint satisfaction for real-world applications.

Abstract: Neural network constraint satisfaction is crucial for safety-critical applications such as power system optimization, robotic path planning, and autonomous driving. However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance.

TL;DR: UACER introduces a diversified critic ensemble and a time-varying decay uncertainty mechanism to stabilize adversarial reinforcement learning in uncertain environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the non-stationarity and instability induced by trainable adversaries in adversarial reinforcement learning, especially in high-dimensional environments.

Method: 1) Diversified critic ensemble for stable Q-value estimation. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty mechanism to dynamically regulate exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

Result: UACER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in MuJoCo control tasks, achieving better performance, stability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: UACER effectively mitigates training instability in adversarial reinforcement learning, demonstrating superior robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Robust adversarial reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective paradigm for training agents to handle uncertain disturbance in real environments, with critical applications in sequential decision-making domains such as autonomous driving and robotic control. Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process. Comprehensive experiments across several MuJoCo control problems validate the superior effectiveness of UACER, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance, stability, and efficiency.

*Chihyeon Song,Jaewoo Lee,Jinkyoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARB dynamically prioritizes data sampling in O2O RL using 'on-policyness' to balance offline stability and online performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance in O2O RL.

Method: Introduces Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a learning-free method that weights transitions based on their alignment with current policy behavior.

Result: ARB mitigates early performance drops and boosts final performance in D4RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARB's adaptive, behavior-aware design is crucial for improving O2O RL algorithms.

Abstract: Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) faces a critical dilemma in balancing the use of a fixed offline dataset with newly collected online experiences. Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences. Our extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves the final performance of various O2O RL algorithms, highlighting the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a disentangled distilled encoder (DDE) framework to compress a model for resource-constrained devices while preserving disentanglement in latent space for OOD reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable deployment of multi-label OOD reasoning models on resource-constrained devices by reducing model size without losing disentanglement properties.

Method: Introduces the DDE framework, using student-teacher distillation with disentanglement constraints, formalized as a constrained optimization problem. Theoretical guarantees are provided using Rademacher complexity.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows successful deployment of the compressed model on an NVIDIA device, maintaining disentanglement.

Conclusion: DDE effectively compresses models for constrained environments while preserving disentanglement, validated by theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: Recently, the disentangled latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE) has been used to reason about multi-label out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples that are derived from different distributions than training samples. Disentangled latent space means having one-to-many maps between latent dimensions and generative factors or important characteristics of an image. This paper proposes a disentangled distilled encoder (DDE) framework to decrease the OOD reasoner size for deployment on resource-constrained devices while preserving disentanglement. DDE formalizes student-teacher distillation for model compression as a constrained optimization problem while preserving disentanglement with disentanglement constraints. Theoretical guarantees for disentanglement during distillation based on Rademacher complexity are established. The approach is evaluated empirically by deploying the compressed model on an NVIDIA

### [217] [Mode-Seeking for Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10524)
*Sai Bharath Chandra Gutha,Ricardo Vinuesa,Hossein Azizpour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the variational mode-seeking loss (VML) to guide samples toward the MAP estimate during reverse diffusion, improving efficiency and accuracy for solving inverse problems without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for solving inverse problems with diffusion models rely on approximations and are computationally intensive. The authors aim to develop a more efficient and accurate approach.

Method: They propose VML, derived from minimizing KL divergence between diffusion and measurement posteriors, and introduce VML-MAP, an algorithm for solving inverse problems.

Result: VML-MAP outperforms existing methods in performance and computational efficiency across diverse image-restoration tasks.

Conclusion: VML and VML-MAP provide a robust and efficient solution for inverse problems, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: A pre-trained unconditional diffusion model, combined with posterior sampling or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation techniques, can solve arbitrary inverse problems without task-specific training or fine-tuning. However, existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods often rely on modeling approximations and can be computationally demanding. In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{y})$, where $\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated. Based on further theoretical insights, we propose VML-MAP, an empirically effective algorithm for solving inverse problems, and validate its efficacy over existing methods in both performance and computational time, through extensive experiments on diverse image-restoration tasks across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: STA-Attention decomposes KV cache into semantic atoms using Top-K SAEs, addressing Key-Value Asymmetry with a Dual-Budget Strategy to maintain model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache inefficiency in long-context models is addressed by making it interpretable and preserving attention geometry.

Method: Top-K Sparse Autoencoders decompose KV cache, eliminating shrinkage bias and introducing a Dual-Budget Strategy.

Result: Semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance across models like Yi-6B and Mistral-7B.

Conclusion: STA-Attention bridges mechanistic interpretability with faithful attention modeling.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is the primary memory bottleneck in long-context Large Language Models, yet it is typically treated as an opaque numerical tensor. In this work, we propose \textbf{STA-Attention}, a framework that utilizes Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose the KV cache into interpretable ``semantic atoms.'' Unlike standard $L_1$-regularized SAEs, our Top-K approach eliminates shrinkage bias, preserving the precise dot-product geometry required for attention. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental \textbf{Key-Value Asymmetry}: while Key vectors serve as highly sparse routers dominated by a ``Semantic Elbow,'' deep Value vectors carry dense content payloads requiring a larger budget. Based on this structure, we introduce a Dual-Budget Strategy that selectively preserves the most informative semantic components while filtering representational noise. Experiments on Yi-6B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-32B, and others show that our semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance comparable to the original models, effectively bridging the gap between mechanistic interpretability and faithful attention modeling.

*Yi Huang,Qingyun Sun,Yisen Gao,Haonan Yuan,Xingcheng Fu,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaT-IB introduces the Minimal-Sufficient-Clean (MSC) criterion to improve robustness against label noise in the Information Bottleneck framework, achieving superior performance through noise-aware disentanglement and a three-phase training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard Information Bottleneck (IB) method is highly sensitive to label noise, which limits its effectiveness in real-world scenarios where noisy labels are common. LaT-IB aims to overcome this limitation by ensuring robustness against label noise while maintaining representation quality.

Method: LaT-IB proposes the MSC criterion and employs noise-aware latent disentanglement to separate clean label information from noise. It uses mutual information bounds for prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and a three-phase training framework (Warmup, Knowledge Injection, Robust Training) to guide noise-resistant learning.

Result: Experimental results show LaT-IB outperforms existing methods in robustness and efficiency under label noise, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: LaT-IB successfully addresses the vulnerability of IB to label noise, offering a scalable and robust solution for representation learning in noisy environments.

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle facilitates effective representation learning by preserving label-relevant information while compressing irrelevant information. However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a "Minimal-Sufficient-Clean" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: THeGAU is a framework combining type-aware graph autoencoder with guided augmentation to enhance HGNN performance by preserving semantics and refining structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HGNNs suffer from type information loss and structural noise, limiting their fidelity and generalization.

Method: THeGAU uses a type-aware graph autoencoder and decoder-driven augmentation to reconstruct edges and refine noisy structures.

Result: Outperforms existing HGNNs on benchmarks (IMDB, ACM, DBLP), achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced overhead.

Conclusion: THeGAU effectively improves HGNNs' robustness, accuracy, and efficiency while minimizing computational costs.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are effective for modeling Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), which encode complex multi-typed entities and relations. However, HGNNs often suffer from type information loss and structural noise, limiting their representational fidelity and generalization. We propose THeGAU, a model-agnostic framework that combines a type-aware graph autoencoder with guided graph augmentation to improve node classification. THeGAU reconstructs schema-valid edges as an auxiliary task to preserve node-type semantics and introduces a decoder-driven augmentation mechanism to selectively refine noisy structures. This joint design enhances robustness, accuracy, and efficiency while significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three benchmark HIN datasets (IMDB, ACM, and DBLP) demonstrate that THeGAU consistently outperforms existing HGNN methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple backbones.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of constrained RL in diverse settings like control, human preference learning, and alignment of large models, ensuring theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Method: Develops algorithms like ACPO for average-cost CMDPs, e-COP for episodic CMDPs, warmPref-PS for preference learning, and MOPO for large model alignment, integrating theoretical insights with scalable implementations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in constrained RL, efficient data collection, robust policy identification, and scalable alignment of large language models.

Conclusion: The thesis unifies constrained RL across paradigms, providing theoretical and practical tools for safe and aligned decision-making.

Abstract: This thesis develops theoretical frameworks and algorithms that advance constrained reinforcement learning (RL) across control, preference learning, and alignment of large language models. The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings. Collectively, the thesis unifies constrained RL across average-cost, episodic, and preference-driven paradigms, delivering theoretical advances and practical tools for safe and aligned decision-making.

*Hendrik Borras,Yong Wu,Bernhard Klein,Holger Fröning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for quantizing Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) is introduced, reducing computational and memory overhead while maintaining accuracy and uncertainty calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and memory challenges of BNNs by applying quantization techniques, enabling deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: A multi-level quantization framework distinguishes three strategies: VPQ, SPQ, and JQ, using logarithmic quantization for variance parameters and specialized activation functions.

Result: BNNs quantized to 4-bit precision retain accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement, with JQ achieving 8x memory reduction.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable BNN deployment and provides guidelines for low-precision Bayesian Machines.

Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide principled uncertainty quantification but suffer from substantial computational and memory overhead compared to deterministic networks. While quantization techniques have successfully reduced resource requirements in standard deep learning models, their application to probabilistic models remains largely unexplored. We introduce a systematic multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference based BNNs that distinguishes between three quantization strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These results enable deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained edge devices and provide design guidelines for future analog "Bayesian Machines" operating at inherently low precision.

Conclusion: Provides policy-relevant forecasts for EU migration governance, aligning with academic recommendations.

Abstract: This paper presents a mixed-methodology to forecast illegal border crossings in Europe across five key migratory routes, with a one-year time horizon. The methodology integrates machine learning techniques with qualitative insights from migration experts. This approach aims at improving the predictive capacity of data-driven models through the inclusion of a human-assessed covariate, an innovation that addresses challenges posed by sudden shifts in migration patterns and limitations in traditional datasets.

It is designed to provide policy-relevant forecasts that inform strategic decisions, early warning systems, and solidarity mechanisms among EU Member States. By joining data-driven modeling with expert judgment, this work aligns with existing academic recommendations and introduces a novel operational tool tailored for EU migration governance. The methodology is tested and validated with known data to demonstrate its applicability and reliability in migration-related policy context.

TL;DR: The paper studies how attention in large language models behaves as sequence lengths grow, introducing 'token-sample complexity' to measure convergence rates of attention maps and token distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize attention behavior at extreme sequence lengths, addressing gaps in knowledge about convergence rates.

Method: Introduces token-sample complexity, analyzes convergence bounds for attention maps and moments of transformed token distributions, and examines the hardmax limit.

Result: Shows uniform convergence at rate C(R)/√n for attention maps and C'(R)/n^β for moments, with experiments confirming predictions.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical insights into attention convergence at large scales, with practical implications for model performance.

Abstract: As context windows in large language models continue to expand, it is essential to characterize how attention behaves at extreme sequence lengths. We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^β$ with $β<\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $β$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence. Experiments on synthetic Gaussian data and real BERT models on Wikipedia text confirm our predictions.

TL;DR: DCFO is introduced as a novel method to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF, addressing its lack of interpretability and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability of outlier detection by explaining why specific points are outliers using counterfactuals, especially for widely used but opaque methods like LOF.

Method: DCFO partitions data into smooth regions for LOF, enabling gradient-based optimization to generate counterfactual explanations.

Result: DCFO outperforms existing methods in proximity and validity of counterfactuals across 50 OpenML datasets.

Conclusion: DCFO effectively addresses LOF's interpretability gap, providing actionable insights through superior counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Outlier detection identifies data points that significantly deviate from the majority of the data distribution. Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF. DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimisation. Extensive experimental validation on 50 OpenML datasets demonstrates that DCFO consistently outperforms benchmarked competitors, offering superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactuals.

It introduces a hierarchical data-generating process and proves its identifiability, achieving improved benchmark results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding compositional generalization's underlying principles and data structures is crucial for extending models' capabilities beyond limited experiences, akin to human analogical reasoning.

Method: A hierarchical data-generating process is introduced, formalized using causal modularity and minimal changes, to decompose and recombine concepts across contexts. Theoretical proofs include identifiability from observable data.

Result: The approach theoretically supports complex relations between composed concepts, advancing beyond simpler interaction assumptions like additive effects, and achieves significant benchmark improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully formalizes compositional generalization, proving the recoverability of latent hierarchical structures and demonstrating practical benefits in benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Compositional generalization -- the ability to understand and generate novel combinations of learned concepts -- enables models to extend their capabilities beyond limited experiences. While effective, the data structures and principles that enable this crucial capability remain poorly understood. We propose that compositional generalization fundamentally requires decomposing high-level concepts into basic, low-level concepts that can be recombined across similar contexts, similar to how humans draw analogies between concepts. For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice.
  In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this approach enables compositional generalization supporting complex relations between composed concepts, advancing beyond prior work that assumes simpler interactions like additive effects. Critically, we also prove that this latent hierarchical structure is provably recoverable (identifiable) from observable data like text-image pairs, a necessary step for learning such a generative process. To validate our theory, we apply insights from our theoretical framework and achieve significant improvements on benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper aims to make deep generative models more interpretable and controllable by using causal minimality principles, introducing a framework for hierarchical selection models, and demonstrating their effectiveness in improving model transparency and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models are powerful but opaque, limiting human understanding and control. The goal is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable models.

Method: Utilizes causal minimality and introduces a theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models. Applies these principles to diffusion vision and autoregressive language models.

Result: Learned representations under minimality conditions align with true latent variables, enabling hierarchical concept extraction and fine-grained model control.

Conclusion: The approach enhances model interpretability, transparency, and reliability, paving the way for more trustworthy generative systems.

Abstract: Deep generative models, while revolutionizing fields like image and text generation, largely operate as opaque black boxes, hindering human understanding, control, and alignment. While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization. Furthermore, these causally grounded concepts serve as levers for fine-grained model steering, paving the way for transparent, reliable systems.

It introduces GSHNet, a hierarchical model boosting feature representation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending neural operators to spherical domains is difficult due to geometry preservation and rotational consistency challenges. Existing methods lack flexibility for complex real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces a framework using spherical Green's functions and harmonic expansion, proposing an adaptable Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) and GSHNet architecture for multi-scale spectral modeling.

Result: GSNO and GSHNet outperform existing methods in tasks like diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting.

Conclusion: GSNO bridges theoretical rigor with practical complexity, offering a general framework for spherical operator learning.

Abstract: Neural operators offer powerful approaches for solving parametric partial differential equations, but extending them to spherical domains remains challenging due to the need to preserve intrinsic geometry while avoiding distortions that break rotational consistency. Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a general operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation. Evaluations on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting, GSNO and GSHNet consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our results position GSNO as a principled and general framework for spherical operator learning, bridging rigorous theory with real-world complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LGAN introduces a line graph aggregation network to enhance expressive power and interpretability in GNNs while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs are limited by the 1-WL test's expressivity or high computational costs of k-WL-based models, coupled with poor interpretability.

Method: LGAN constructs a line graph from induced subgraphs for higher-order aggregation, balancing power and efficiency.

Result: LGAN surpasses k-WL-based GNNs in benchmarks, with proven greater expressive power than 2-WL and lower complexity.

Conclusion: LGAN offers a scalable and interpretable solution for graph classification, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for graph classification. Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity. Empirical evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the LGAN outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs, while offering better interpretability.

*Hang Ni,Weijia Zhang,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniExtreme is a universal model for extreme weather forecasting, addressing spectral disparities and hierarchical drivers of extreme events through adaptive frequency modulation and event prior augmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to fully capture the diversified patterns of extreme weather events, focusing either on general conditions or specific extremes.

Method: UniExtreme integrates an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module to handle spectral disparities and an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module to address hierarchical drivers, using learnable filters and memory fusion networks.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting both extreme and general weather, demonstrating superior adaptability.

Conclusion: UniExtreme effectively bridges gaps in extreme weather forecasting by addressing key characteristics of extreme events, offering improved performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation, and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) to address limitations in interpretability and steerability of existing SAEs for LLMs and LVLMs, achieving significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAEs often lack interpretability and steerability, limiting their practical utility for mechanistic interpretability and concept discovery in models.

Method: CB-SAE prunes ineffective neurons and adds a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned with user-defined concepts.

Result: CB-SAE improves interpretability by 32.1% and steerability by 14.5% in LVLMs and image generation tasks.

Conclusion: CB-SAE offers a promising solution to enhance the practical use of SAEs in model interpretability and steering.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) promise a unified approach for mechanistic interpretability, concept discovery, and model steering in LLMs and LVLMs. However, realizing this potential requires that the learned features be both interpretable and steerable. To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set. The resulting CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks. We will make our code and model weights available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable neural networks to extrapolate periodic functions without knowing their form.

Method: Use Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E) for input encoding in MLPs.

Result: MLPs with NB2E successfully extrapolate diverse periodic signals.

Conclusion: NB2E's bit-phase representation allows MLPs to learn and extrapolate periodic signals.

Abstract: We report the discovery that binary encoding allows neural networks to extrapolate periodic functions beyond their training bounds. We introduce Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E) as a method for encoding continuous numerical values and demonstrate that, using this input encoding, vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) successfully extrapolate diverse periodic signals without prior knowledge of their functional form. Internal activation analysis reveals that NB2E induces bit-phase representations, enabling MLPs to learn and extrapolate signal structure independently of position.

### [234] [Learning Controllable and Diverse Player Behaviors in Multi-Agent Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10835)
*Atahan Cilan,Atay Özgövde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework enables controllable, diverse player behaviors without human data, using continuous behavior vectors and PPO-based training for scalable, adaptable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require large-scale player data or lack scalability and controllability. This work aims to overcome these limitations by defining behaviors in a continuous space and enabling smooth control over attributes like aggressiveness.

Method: Player behavior is defined in an N-dimensional space. Agents receive current and target behavior vectors, with rewards based on reducing the distance between them. A single PPO-based policy learns to control behavioral attributes without retraining.

Result: Experiments show greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliable matching of specified behavior vectors. The framework works for various play styles without retraining.

Conclusion: The method is scalable for playtesting, game balancing, simulating human-like behavior, and replacing disconnected players, offering a versatile solution.

Abstract: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that enables controllable and diverse player behaviors without relying on human gameplay data. Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets. The method offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games.

*Chirag Modi,Jiequn Han,Eric Vanden-Eijnden,Joan Bruna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCSI introduces a transport-based generative model for clean data from noisy measurements, leveraging iterative updates and black-box access to corruption channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transport-based methods require clean datasets, but many domains only provide noisy, corrupted measurements, necessitating a solution for inverse problems at the distribution level.

Method: The method uses Stochastic Interpolants to iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean samples, relying solely on corrupted data and black-box access to the corruption channel.

Result: SCSI is efficient, flexible (handles nonlinear models), and theoretically sound, outperforming alternatives in image processing and scientific reconstruction.

Conclusion: SCSI effectively inverts corruption channels to model clean data, offering computational efficiency, flexibility, and proven convergence.

Abstract: Transport-based methods have emerged as a leading paradigm for building generative models from large, clean datasets. However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate superior performance on inverse problems in natural image processing and scientific reconstruction, and establish convergence guarantees of the scheme under appropriate assumptions.

### [236] [Scaling Behavior of Discrete Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10858)
*Dimitri von Rütte,Janis Fluri,Omead Pooladzandi,Bernhard Schölkopf,Thomas Hofmann,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the scaling behavior of discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) compared to autoregressive language models (ALMs), focusing on noise types (masked vs. uniform) and hyperparameters. It finds uniform diffusion more efficient in data-bound settings and scales a model to 10B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the scaling laws of DLMs vs. ALMs is crucial due to their high compute and data demands, yet DLMs' scaling behavior remains understudied.

Method: The study interpolates between masked and uniform diffusion noise types, adjusting hyperparameters like batch size and learning rate. Experiments analyze scaling behavior across noise types.

Result: Uniform diffusion requires more parameters but less data for efficient training compared to masked diffusion, differing from ALMs. A 10B-parameter uniform diffusion model confirms these findings.

Conclusion: Uniform diffusion DLMs are promising for data-bound settings, offering distinct scaling advantages over masked diffusion and ALMs.

Abstract: Modern LLM pre-training consumes vast amounts of compute and training data, making the scaling behavior, or scaling laws, of different models a key distinguishing factor. Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs.
  We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.
