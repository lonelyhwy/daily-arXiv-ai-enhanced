### [1] [Complex Mathematical Expression Recognition: Benchmark, Large-Scale Dataset and Strong Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13731)
*Weikang Bai,Yongkun Du,Yuchen Su,Yazhen Xie,Zhineng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of recognizing complex mathematical expressions by introducing new datasets (MER-17M, CMER-3M), a novel tokenizer, and CMERNet, a specialized model that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER models struggle with complex expressions due to limited training data and lack of robust spatial layout modeling.

Method: Introduces CMER-Bench for evaluation, proposes large-scale datasets (MER-17M, CMER-3M), a new tokenizer, and the CMERNet model with Structured Mathematical Language representation.

Result: CMERNet outperforms existing MER models and MLLMs on CMER-Bench, despite having fewer parameters (125M).

Conclusion: The proposed datasets, tokenizer, and CMERNet significantly improve complex MER performance, highlighting the importance of specialized datasets and spatial modeling.

Abstract: Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) has made significant progress in recognizing simple expressions, but the robust recognition of complex mathematical expressions with many tokens and multiple lines remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we first introduce CMER-Bench, a carefully constructed benchmark that categorizes expressions into three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and complex. Leveraging CMER-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing MER models and general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The results reveal that while current methods perform well on easy and moderate expressions, their performance degrades significantly when handling complex mathematical expressions, mainly because existing public training datasets are primarily composed of simple samples. In response, we propose MER-17M and CMER-3M that are large-scale datasets emphasizing the recognition of complex mathematical expressions. The datasets provide rich and diverse samples to support the development of accurate and robust complex MER models. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by the complicated spatial layout of complex expressions, we introduce a novel expression tokenizer, and a new representation called Structured Mathematical Language, which explicitly models the hierarchical and spatial structure of expressions beyond LaTeX format. Based on these, we propose a specialized model named CMERNet, built upon an encoder-decoder architecture and trained on CMER-3M. Experimental results show that CMERNet, with only 125 million parameters, significantly outperforms existing MER models and MLLMs on CMER-Bench.

### [2] [Human-AI Collaboration Mechanism Study on AIGC Assisted Image Production for Special Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13739)
*Yajie Yang,Yuqing Zhao,Xiaochao Xi,Yinan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores controllable AI-generated image production in journalism, addressing issues like misinformation and trust, and proposes a human-AI collaboration mechanism through two experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address controversies and ethical dilemmas in AI-generated journalism content, focusing on accuracy, authenticity, and trust.

Method: Conducts two experiments: testing cross-platform adaptability and building a modular human-in-the-loop pipeline for editorial fidelity.

Result: Identifies biases in semantic alignment and proposes solutions like traceable deployment and human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: Recommends evaluating Character Identity Stability, Cultural Expression Accuracy, and User-Public Appropriateness for ethical AI use in journalism.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) assisting image production triggers controversy in journalism while attracting attention from media agencies. Key issues involve misinformation, authenticity, semantic fidelity, and interpretability. Most AIGC tools are opaque "black boxes," hindering the dual demands of content accuracy and semantic alignment and creating ethical, sociotechnical, and trust dilemmas. This paper explores pathways for controllable image production in journalism's special coverage and conducts two experiments with projects from China's media agency: (1) Experiment 1 tests cross-platform adaptability via standardized prompts across three scenes, revealing disparities in semantic alignment, cultural specificity, and visual realism driven by training-corpus bias and platform-level filtering. (2) Experiment 2 builds a human-in-the-loop modular pipeline combining high-precision segmentation (SAM, GroundingDINO), semantic alignment (BrushNet), and style regulating (Style-LoRA, Prompt-to-Prompt), ensuring editorial fidelity through CLIP-based semantic scoring, NSFW/OCR/YOLO filtering, and verifiable content credentials. Traceable deployment preserves semantic representation. Consequently, we propose a human-AI collaboration mechanism for AIGC assisted image production in special coverage and recommend evaluating Character Identity Stability (CIS), Cultural Expression Accuracy (CEA), and User-Public Appropriateness (U-PA).

### [3] [DL$^3$M: A Vision-to-Language Framework for Expert-Level Medical Reasoning through Deep Learning and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13742)
*Md. Najib Hasan,Imran Ahmad,Sourav Basak Shuvo,Md. Mahadi Hasan Ankon,Sunanda Das,Nazmul Siddique,Hui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework combining image classification with LLM-driven clinical reasoning to bridge gaps in medical AI explanations, but highlights LLMs' unreliability for high-stakes decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical AI lacks explainability, and LLMs struggle with visual reasoning and stability, creating a disconnect from clinician expectations.

Method: A hybrid model (MobileCoAtNet) classifies endoscopic images, and its outputs guide LLM reasoning. Benchmarks evaluate LLM performance across clinical topics.

Result: Strong classification improves LLM explanations, but no LLM matches human stability. Prompt variations affect reasoning quality.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for clinical narratives but underscores LLMs' unreliability in high-stakes settings, suggesting a path for safer systems.

Abstract: Medical image classifiers detect gastrointestinal diseases well, but they do not explain their decisions. Large language models can generate clinical text, yet they struggle with visual reasoning and often produce unstable or incorrect explanations. This leaves a gap between what a model sees and the type of reasoning a clinician expects. We introduce a framework that links image classification with structured clinical reasoning. A new hybrid model, MobileCoAtNet, is designed for endoscopic images and achieves high accuracy across eight stomach-related classes. Its outputs are then used to drive reasoning by several LLMs. To judge this reasoning, we build two expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care. Thirty-two LLMs are evaluated against these gold standards. Strong classification improves the quality of their explanations, but none of the models reach human-level stability. Even the best LLMs change their reasoning when prompts vary. Our study shows that combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions. The framework provides a clearer view of their limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems.

### [4] [Why Text Prevails: Vision May Undermine Multimodal Medical Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13747)
*Siyuan Dai,Lunxiao Li,Kun Zhao,Eardi Lila,Paul K. Crane,Heng Huang,Dongkuan Xu,Haoteng Tang,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with biomedical decision-making tasks despite excelling in general vision-language tasks. Text-only reasoning outperforms multimodal approaches, highlighting limitations in visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why state-of-the-art MLLMs perform poorly on medical decision-making tasks, even though they excel in general multimodal tasks.

Method: Evaluated MLLMs on two biomedical datasets: Alzheimer's disease classification and chest radiograph classification. Explored strategies like in-context learning, vision captioning, and few-shot fine-tuning.

Result: Text-only reasoning consistently outperformed multimodal approaches. Multimodal inputs often performed worse than text alone.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs lack grounded visual understanding in biomedical contexts. Proposed strategies offer promising directions for improvement.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities on vision-language tasks. In the biomedical domain, however, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with basic Medical Decision Making (MDM) tasks. We investigate this limitation using two challenging datasets: (1) three-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification (normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia), where category differences are visually subtle, and (2) MIMIC-CXR chest radiograph classification with 14 non-mutually exclusive conditions. Our empirical study shows that text-only reasoning consistently outperforms vision-only or vision-text settings, with multimodal inputs often performing worse than text alone. To mitigate this, we explore three strategies: (1) in-context learning with reason-annotated exemplars, (2) vision captioning followed by text-only inference, and (3) few-shot fine-tuning of the vision tower with classification supervision. These findings reveal that current MLLMs lack grounded visual understanding and point to promising directions for improving multimodal decision making in healthcare.

### [5] [STAR: STacked AutoRegressive Scheme for Unified Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13752)
*Jie Qin,Jiancheng Huang,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAR introduces a stacked autoregressive scheme for unified multimodal learning, decomposing tasks into understanding, generation, and editing stages to avoid interference while enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of unified multimodal understanding and generation by balancing optimization conflicts and performance trade-offs.

Method: A task-progressive approach with stacked isomorphic autoregressive modules, frozen parameters, and high-capacity VQ for image granularity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval (0.91), DPG-Bench (87.44), and ImgEdit (4.34).

Conclusion: STAR effectively balances comprehension and generation, offering a robust solution for unified multimodal learning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) play a pivotal role in advancing the quest for general artificial intelligence. However, achieving unified target for multimodal understanding and generation remains challenging due to optimization conflicts and performance trade-offs. To effectively enhance generative performance while preserving existing comprehension capabilities, we introduce STAR: a STacked AutoRegressive scheme for task-progressive unified multimodal learning. This approach decomposes multimodal learning into multiple stages: understanding, generation, and editing. By freezing the parameters of the fundamental autoregressive (AR) model and progressively stacking isomorphic AR modules, it avoids cross-task interference while expanding the model's capabilities. Concurrently, we introduce a high-capacity VQ to enhance the granularity of image representations and employ an implicit reasoning mechanism to improve generation quality under complex conditions. Experiments demonstrate that STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval (0.91), DPG-Bench (87.44), and ImgEdit (4.34), validating its efficacy for unified multimodal learning.

### [6] [Time-aware UNet and super-resolution deep residual networks for spatial downscaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13753)
*Mika Sipilä,Sabrina Maggio,Sandra De Iaco,Klaus Nordhausen,Monica Palma,Sara Taskinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses deep learning methods (SRDRN and UNet) enhanced with temporal modules for spatial downscaling of tropospheric ozone satellite data, showing improved performance and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coarse spatial resolution limits the utility of satellite pollutant data for local-scale applications, motivating the need for effective downscaling methods.

Method: Extended SRDRN and UNet architectures with lightweight temporal modules (sinusoidal/RBF encoding) to fuse temporal features with spatial representations.

Result: Time-aware extensions significantly enhance downscaling performance and convergence speed with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal features improves deep learning-based spatial downscaling of ozone data, making it more practical for local environmental analysis.

Abstract: Satellite data of atmospheric pollutants are often available only at coarse spatial resolution, limiting their applicability in local-scale environmental analysis and decision-making. Spatial downscaling methods aim to transform the coarse satellite data into high-resolution fields. In this work, two widely used deep learning architectures, the super-resolution deep residual network (SRDRN) and the encoder-decoder-based UNet, are considered for spatial downscaling of tropospheric ozone. Both methods are extended with a lightweight temporal module, which encodes observation time using either sinusoidal or radial basis function (RBF) encoding, and fuses the temporal features with the spatial representations in the networks. The proposed time-aware extensions are evaluated against their baseline counterparts in a case study on ozone downscaling over Italy. The results suggest that, while only slightly increasing computational complexity, the temporal modules significantly improve downscaling performance and convergence speed.

### [7] [Nexels: Neurally-Textured Surfels for Real-Time Novel View Synthesis with Sparse Geometries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13796)
*Victor Rong,Jan Held,Victor Chu,Daniel Rebain,Marc Van Droogenbroeck,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,Andrea Tagliasacchi,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact representation combining surfels for geometry and neural fields for appearance reduces primitive count and memory usage without sacrificing perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian splatting requires millions of primitives for highly textured scenes, even when geometry is simple, leading to inefficiency.

Method: The proposed method uses surfels for geometry and a global neural field with per-primitive colors for appearance, ensuring low computational overhead.

Result: Achieves comparable perceptual quality to 3D Gaussian splatting but with significantly fewer primitives (up to 31× fewer) and reduced memory usage (up to 5.5× less), while rendering twice as fast.

Conclusion: The decoupled geometry and appearance representation offers a more efficient and compact alternative to traditional point-based rendering without compromising visual quality.

Abstract: Though Gaussian splatting has achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis, it requires millions of primitives to model highly textured scenes, even when the geometry of the scene is simple. We propose a representation that goes beyond point-based rendering and decouples geometry and appearance in order to achieve a compact representation. We use surfels for geometry and a combination of a global neural field and per-primitive colours for appearance. The neural field textures a fixed number of primitives for each pixel, ensuring that the added compute is low. Our representation matches the perceptual quality of 3D Gaussian splatting while using $9.7\times$ fewer primitives and $5.5\times$ less memory on outdoor scenes and using $31\times$ fewer primitives and $3.7\times$ less memory on indoor scenes. Our representation also renders twice as fast as existing textured primitives while improving upon their visual quality.

### [9] [MoLingo: Motion-Language Alignment for Text-to-Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13840)
*Yannan He,Garvita Tiwari,Xiaohan Zhang,Pankaj Bora,Tolga Birdal,Jan Eric Lenssen,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoLingo, a text-to-motion model, generates realistic human motion by denoising in a continuous latent space, focusing on semantic alignment and text conditioning for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the effectiveness of diffusion in continuous motion latents by addressing semantic alignment and text conditioning.

Method: It introduces a semantic-aligned motion encoder trained with frame-level text labels and compares single-token conditioning with multi-token cross-attention.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in human motion generation on standard metrics and a user study.

Conclusion: MoLingo demonstrates the benefits of semantic alignment and cross-attention conditioning, with plans to release code and models for further research.

Abstract: We introduce MoLingo, a text-to-motion (T2M) model that generates realistic, lifelike human motion by denoising in a continuous latent space. Recent works perform latent space diffusion, either on the whole latent at once or auto-regressively over multiple latents. In this paper, we study how to make diffusion on continuous motion latents work best. We focus on two questions: (1) how to build a semantically aligned latent space so diffusion becomes more effective, and (2) how to best inject text conditioning so the motion follows the description closely. We propose a semantic-aligned motion encoder trained with frame-level text labels so that latents with similar text meaning stay close, which makes the latent space more diffusion-friendly. We also compare single-token conditioning with a multi-token cross-attention scheme and find that cross-attention gives better motion realism and text-motion alignment. With semantically aligned latents, auto-regressive generation, and cross-attention text conditioning, our model sets a new state of the art in human motion generation on standard metrics and in a user study. We will release our code and models for further research and downstream usage.

### [10] [Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Alignment for UAV-based Human Detection using Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13869)
*Wenda Li,Meng Wu,Sungmin Eum,Heesung Kwon,Qing Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CFHA, a three-stage diffusion-based framework to narrow the domain gap between synthetic and real images for UAV-based human detection, improving detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled images and shifting target distributions in UAV-based human detection make synthetic data essential, but domain gaps hinder effectiveness. CFHA addresses this.

Method: CFHA uses three modules: Global Style Transfer for style alignment, Local Refinement for detail enhancement, and Hallucination Removal to filter unrealistic human instances.

Result: Experiments show CFHA improves detection accuracy significantly, achieving up to +14.1 mAP50 on the Semantic-Drone benchmark.

Conclusion: CFHA effectively bridges synthetic-to-real domain gaps hierarchically, enhancing UAV-based human detection.

Abstract: Training object detectors demands extensive, task-specific annotations, yet this requirement becomes impractical in UAV-based human detection due to constantly shifting target distributions and the scarcity of labeled images. As a remedy, synthetic simulators are adopted to generate annotated data, with a low annotation cost. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real images hinders the model from being effectively applied to the target domain. Accordingly, we introduce Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Alignment (CFHA), a three-stage diffusion-based framework designed to transform synthetic data for UAV-based human detection, narrowing the domain gap while preserving the original synthetic labels. CFHA explicitly decouples global style and local content domain discrepancies and bridges those gaps using three modules: (1) Global Style Transfer -- a diffusion model aligns color, illumination, and texture statistics of synthetic images to the realistic style, using only a small real reference set; (2) Local Refinement -- a super-resolution diffusion model is used to facilitate fine-grained and photorealistic details for the small objects, such as human instances, preserving shape and boundary integrity; (3) Hallucination Removal -- a module that filters out human instances whose visual attributes do not align with real-world data to make the human appearance closer to the target distribution. Extensive experiments on public UAV Sim2Real detection benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the detection accuracy compared to the non-transformed baselines. Specifically, our method achieves up to $+14.1$ improvement of mAP50 on Semantic-Drone benchmark. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of the global and local stages and highlight the importance of hierarchical alignment. The code is released at \href{https://github.com/liwd190019/CFHA}{this url}.

### [11] [SAGE: Training Smart Any-Horizon Agents for Long Video Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13874)
*Jitesh Jain,Jialuo Li,Zixian Ma,Jieyu Zhang,Chris Dongjoo Kim,Sangho Lee,Rohun Tripathi,Tanmay Gupta,Christopher Clark,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE is a system enabling multi-turn reasoning on long videos, balancing efficiency and performance through synthetic data, RL training, and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mimic human any-horizon reasoning in video systems, addressing the inefficiency of current SOTA models.

Method: Introduces SAGE (agent system), synthetic data generation via Gemini-2.5-Flash, RL post-training, and SAGE-Bench for evaluation.

Result: Improves open-ended video reasoning by 6.1% and long videos (>10 min) by 8.2%.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates effective any-horizon reasoning, outperforming traditional single-turn models.

Abstract: As humans, we are natural any-horizon reasoners, i.e., we can decide whether to iteratively skim long videos or watch short ones in full when necessary for a given task. With this in mind, one would expect video reasoning models to reason flexibly across different durations. However, SOTA models are still trained to predict answers in a single turn while processing a large number of frames, akin to watching an entire long video, requiring significant resources. This raises the question: Is it possible to develop performant any-horizon video reasoning systems? Inspired by human behavior, we first propose SAGE, an agent system that performs multi-turn reasoning on long videos while handling simpler problems in a single turn. Secondly, we introduce an easy synthetic data generation pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Flash to train the orchestrator, SAGE-MM, which lies at the core of SAGE. We further propose an effective RL post-training recipe essential for instilling any-horizon reasoning ability in SAGE-MM. Thirdly, we curate SAGE-Bench with an average duration of greater than 700 seconds for evaluating video reasoning ability in real-world entertainment use cases. Lastly, we empirically validate the effectiveness of our system, data, and RL recipe, observing notable improvements of up to 6.1% on open-ended video reasoning tasks, as well as an impressive 8.2% improvement on videos longer than 10 minutes.

### [12] [Route-DETR: Pairwise Query Routing in Transformers for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13876)
*Ye Zhang,Qi Chen,Wenyou Huang,Rui Liu,Zhengjian Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Route-DETR improves DETR by addressing inefficient query competition through adaptive pairwise routing in decoder self-attention layers, achieving better performance without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR's inefficiency arises from redundant computations due to multiple queries converging to similar positions. Route-DETR aims to resolve this by distinguishing between competing and complementary queries.

Method: Route-DETR uses adaptive pairwise routing with suppressor and delegator routes based on inter-query similarity, confidence scores, and geometry. It employs learnable low-rank attention biases and a dual-branch training strategy.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements, with +1.7% mAP gain over DINO on ResNet-50 and 57.6% mAP on Swin-L, surpassing prior state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Route-DETR effectively reduces redundancy in DETR queries, enhancing performance without increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Detection Transformer (DETR) offers an end-to-end solution for object detection by eliminating hand-crafted components like non-maximum suppression. However, DETR suffers from inefficient query competition where multiple queries converge to similar positions, leading to redundant computations. We present Route-DETR, which addresses these issues through adaptive pairwise routing in decoder self-attention layers. Our key insight is distinguishing between competing queries (targeting the same object) versus complementary queries (targeting different objects) using inter-query similarity, confidence scores, and geometry. We introduce dual routing mechanisms: suppressor routes that modulate attention between competing queries to reduce duplication, and delegator routes that encourage exploration of different regions. These are implemented via learnable low-rank attention biases enabling asymmetric query interactions. A dual-branch training strategy incorporates routing biases only during training while preserving standard attention for inference, ensuring no additional computational cost. Experiments on COCO and Cityscapes demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple DETR baselines, achieving +1.7% mAP gain over DINO on ResNet-50 and reaching 57.6% mAP on Swin-L, surpassing prior state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes KLO-Net, a dynamic K-NN attention U-Net with CSP encoder for efficient prostate MRI segmentation, addressing computational load and variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time prostate MRI segmentation is hindered by computational load and anatomical variability. KLO-Net aims to bridge the efficiency gap while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Uses a dynamic K-NN attention mechanism and CSP blocks to reduce memory consumption and adaptively determine attention connections.

Result: Evaluated on PROMISE12 and PROSTATEx datasets, KLO-Net shows improved computational efficiency and segmentation quality.

Conclusion: KLO-Net effectively balances efficiency and accuracy for prostate gland segmentation in MRI scans.

Abstract: Real-time deployment of prostate MRI segmentation on clinical workstations is often bottlenecked by computational load and memory footprint. Deep learning-based prostate gland segmentation approaches remain challenging due to anatomical variability. To bridge this efficiency gap while still maintaining reliable segmentation accuracy, we propose KLO-Net, a dynamic K-Nearest Neighbor attention U-Net with Cross Stage Partial, i.e., CSP, encoder for efficient prostate gland segmentation from MRI scan. Unlike the regular K-NN attention mechanism, the proposed dynamic K-NN attention mechanism allows the model to adaptively determine the number of attention connections for each spatial location within a slice. In addition, CSP blocks address the computational load to reduce memory consumption. To evaluate the model's performance, comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on two public datasets, i.e., PROMISE12 and PROSTATEx, to validate the proposed architecture. The detailed comparative analysis demonstrates the model's advantage in computational efficiency and segmentation quality.

### [14] [An evaluation of SVBRDF Prediction from Generative Image Models for Appearance Modeling of 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13950)
*Alban Gauthier,Valentin Deschaintre,Alexandre Lanvin,Fredo Durand,Adrien Bousseau,George Drettakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores SVBRDF prediction in a fast appearance modeling pipeline, analyzing challenges like multiview incoherence and opportunities from generated RGB images, finding a standard UNet surprisingly effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges and leverage opportunities in SVBRDF prediction for fast appearance modeling pipelines, especially with deep generative models.

Method: The study compares neural architectures and conditions to identify designs achieving high accuracy and coherence in SVBRDF prediction, evaluating their performance.

Result: A standard UNet performs competitively against more complex designs for SVBRDF prediction.

Conclusion: The simplicity of a UNet can effectively address SVBRDF prediction challenges, offering a practical solution in fast appearance modeling pipelines.

Abstract: Digital content creation is experiencing a profound change with the advent of deep generative models. For texturing, conditional image generators now allow the synthesis of realistic RGB images of a 3D scene that align with the geometry of that scene. For appearance modeling, SVBRDF prediction networks recover material parameters from RGB images. Combining these technologies allows us to quickly generate SVBRDF maps for multiple views of a 3D scene, which can be merged to form a SVBRDF texture atlas of that scene. In this paper, we analyze the challenges and opportunities for SVBRDF prediction in the context of such a fast appearance modeling pipeline. On the one hand, single-view SVBRDF predictions might suffer from multiview incoherence and yield inconsistent texture atlases. On the other hand, generated RGB images, and the different modalities on which they are conditioned, can provide additional information for SVBRDF estimation compared to photographs. We compare neural architectures and conditions to identify designs that achieve high accuracy and coherence. We find that, surprisingly, a standard UNet is competitive with more complex designs.

### [15] [From Unlearning to UNBRANDING: A Benchmark for Trademark-Safe Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13953)
*Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Filip Manjak,Maciej Zięba,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'unbranding,' a task to remove trademarks and subtle structural brand features from images while maintaining coherence, addressing gaps in existing brand recognition methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unauthorized reproduction of trademarked content by text-to-image diffusion models raises concerns, especially as existing methods overlook specific brand identifiers and subtle features like trade dress.

Method: The authors propose unbranding, create a benchmark dataset, and introduce a VLM-based evaluation metric to detect both explicit logos and implicit brand characteristics.

Result: Newer diffusion models (e.g., SDXL, FLUX) reproduce brand identifiers more readily, emphasizing the need for unbranding techniques validated by the VLM metric.

Conclusion: Unbranding is a distinct problem requiring specialized solutions, highlighted by the limitations of current brand detectors and the increasing fidelity of generative models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of text-to-image diffusion models raises significant concerns regarding the unauthorized reproduction of trademarked content. While prior work targets general concepts (e.g., styles, celebrities), it fails to address specific brand identifiers. Crucially, we note that brand recognition is multi-dimensional, extending beyond explicit logos to encompass distinctive structural features (e.g., a car's front grille). To tackle this, we introduce unbranding, a novel task for the fine-grained removal of both trademarks and subtle structural brand features, while preserving semantic coherence. To facilitate research, we construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset. Recognizing that existing brand detectors are limited to logos and fail to capture abstract trade dress (e.g., the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle), we introduce a novel evaluation metric based on Vision Language Models (VLMs). This VLM-based metric uses a question-answering framework to probe images for both explicit logos and implicit, holistic brand characteristics. Furthermore, we observe that as model fidelity increases, with newer systems (SDXL, FLUX) synthesizing brand identifiers more readily than older models (Stable Diffusion), the urgency of the unbranding challenge is starkly highlighted. Our results, validated by our VLM metric, confirm unbranding is a distinct, practically relevant problem requiring specialized techniques. Project Page: https://gmum.github.io/UNBRANDING/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Improves marine obstacle detection by enhancing training data diversity using a quality-driven, diversity-aware sample expansion pipeline, boosting segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine obstacle detection faces challenges like poor image quality due to sun glitter, fog, and repetitive datasets, limiting training data variety. Current methods produce low-diversity outputs, reducing robustness.

Method: Proposes a pipeline with a class-aware style bank for high-entropy prompts and an adaptive annealing sampler to perturb conditioning, regulated by a COD-guided controller for diversity.

Result: Synthetic samples improve segmentation performance across benchmarks and enhance visual variation in rare and texture-sensitive classes.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively addresses data diversity issues in marine obstacle detection, improving model robustness and performance without retraining.

Abstract: Marine obstacle detection demands robust segmentation under challenging conditions, such as sun glitter, fog, and rapidly changing wave patterns. These factors degrade image quality, while the scarcity and structural repetition of marine datasets limit the diversity of available training data. Although mask-conditioned diffusion models can synthesize layout-aligned samples, they often produce low-diversity outputs when conditioned on low-entropy masks and prompts, limiting their utility for improving robustness. In this paper, we propose a quality-driven and diversity-aware sample expansion pipeline that generates training data entirely at inference time, without retraining the diffusion model. The framework combines two key components:(i) a class-aware style bank that constructs high-entropy, semantically grounded prompts, and (ii) an adaptive annealing sampler that perturbs early conditioning, while a COD-guided proportional controller regulates this perturbation to boost diversity without compromising layout fidelity. Across marine obstacle benchmarks, augmenting training data with these controlled synthetic samples consistently improves segmentation performance across multiple backbones and increases visual variation in rare and texture-sensitive classes.

*Dereje Shenkut,Vijayakumar Bhagavatula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocalComm is a CP framework for autonomous driving that improves pedestrian detection by focusing on hard-instance features and dynamic fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CP methods prioritize vehicle detection and underperform on smaller, safety-critical objects like pedestrians, risking catastrophic failures.

Method: FocalComm introduces a learnable HIM module for hard-instance feature extraction and a query-based fusion technique for dynamic feature weighting.

Result: FocalComm outperforms existing CP methods on V2X-Real and DAIR-V2X datasets, with notable gains in pedestrian detection.

Conclusion: FocalComm advances CP by targeting hard instances, enhancing safety for vulnerable road users like pedestrians.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) is a promising paradigm for improving autonomous driving safety, particularly for vulnerable road users like pedestrians, via robust 3D perception. However, existing CP approaches often optimize for vehicle detection performance metrics, underperforming on smaller, safety-critical objects such as pedestrians, where detection failures can be catastrophic. Furthermore, previous CP methods rely on full feature exchange rather than communicating only salient features that help reduce false negatives. To this end, we present FocalComm, a novel collaborative perception framework that focuses on exchanging hard-instance-oriented features among connected collaborative agents. FocalComm consists of two key novel designs: (1) a learnable progressive hard instance mining (HIM) module to extract hard instance-oriented features per agent, and (2) a query-based feature-level (intermediate) fusion technique that dynamically weights these identified features during collaboration. We show that FocalComm outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods on two challenging real-world datasets (V2X-Real and DAIR-V2X) across both vehicle-centric and infrastructure-centric collaborative setups. FocalComm also shows a strong performance gain in pedestrian detection in V2X-Real.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of 3D diffusion models due to scarce high-quality datasets and modality gaps between 3D inputs and 2D latent spaces.

Method: Introduces the Shape Atlas, a compact 2D representation of 3D geometry, enabling pretrained 2D diffusion models' use and aligning input-output modalities.

Result: Achieves high-quality, detail-preserving 3D shape completions, validated on PCN and ShapeNet-55 datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages 2D diffusion models for 3D tasks, demonstrating practicality through downstream applications like artist-created meshes.

Abstract: We present a framework that adapts 2D diffusion models for 3D shape completion from incomplete point clouds. While text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success with abundant 2D data, 3D diffusion models lag due to the scarcity of high-quality 3D datasets and a persistent modality gap between 3D inputs and 2D latent spaces. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Shape Atlas, a compact 2D representation of 3D geometry that (1) enables full utilization of the generative power of pretrained 2D diffusion models, and (2) aligns the modalities between the conditional input and output spaces, allowing more effective conditioning. This unified 2D formulation facilitates learning from limited 3D data and produces high-quality, detail-preserving shape completions. We validate the effectiveness of our results on the PCN and ShapeNet-55 datasets. Additionally, we show the downstream application of creating artist-created meshes from our completed point clouds, further demonstrating the practicality of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDMs have strong performance but suffer from slow inference due to redundant token processing.

Method: Proposes Sparse-LaViDa, which truncates masked tokens dynamically, uses register tokens for truncated tokens, and ensures training-inference consistency with specialized attention masks.

Result: Achieves up to 2x speedup in tasks like text-to-image generation, image editing, and mathematical reasoning while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: Sparse-LaViDa effectively balances speed and performance in MDMs for multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Masked Discrete Diffusion Models (MDMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks, including image understanding, generation, and editing. However, their inference speed remains suboptimal due to the need to repeatedly process redundant masked tokens at every sampling step. In this work, we propose Sparse-LaViDa, a novel modeling framework that dynamically truncates unnecessary masked tokens at each inference step to accelerate MDM sampling. To preserve generation quality, we introduce specialized register tokens that serve as compact representations for the truncated tokens. Furthermore, to ensure consistency between training and inference, we design a specialized attention mask that faithfully matches the truncated sampling procedure during training. Built upon the state-of-the-art unified MDM LaViDa-O, Sparse-LaViDa achieves up to a 2x speedup across diverse tasks including text-to-image generation, image editing, and mathematical reasoning, while maintaining generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Key frame sampling is essential for efficient long-form video understanding in QA tasks, but prior works lacked direct evaluation methods.

Method: KFS-Bench provides multi-scene annotations for direct analysis of sampling approaches. It introduces a novel sampling quality metric and a question-video relevance-based sampling method.

Result: The benchmark identifies precision, scene coverage, and sampling balance as key factors for QA performance. The proposed sampling method outperforms others.

Conclusion: KFS-Bench enables robust evaluation of sampling strategies, and the novel adaptive sampling approach enhances QA performance.

Abstract: We propose KFS-Bench, the first benchmark for key frame sampling in long video question answering (QA), featuring multi-scene annotations to enable direct and robust evaluation of sampling strategies. Key frame sampling is crucial for efficient long-form video understanding. In long video QA, selecting informative frames enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve both accuracy and efficiency. KFS-Bench addresses the limitation of prior works that only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy. By providing ground-truth annotations of multiple disjoint scenes required per question, KFS-Bench allows us to directly analyze how different sampling approaches capture essential content across an entire long video. Using KFS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods and identify that not only sampling precision but also scene coverage and sampling balance are the key factors influencing QA performance. Regarding all the factors, we design a novel sampling quality metric that correlates with QA accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a novel key frame sampling method that leverages question-video relevance to balance sampling diversity against question-frame similarity, thereby improving coverage of relevant scenes. Our adaptively balanced sampling approach achieves superior performance in both key frame sampling and QA performance. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/NEC-VID/KFS-Bench.

TL;DR: CITab is a novel SSL framework for multi-modal learning that integrates medical images and tabular data, overcoming limitations of rigid tabular modeling to enable cross-tabular knowledge transfer and scalable pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods for image-tabular data are limited by rigid tabular modeling, hindering transferrable knowledge learning across diverse cohorts. CITab aims to address this gap.

Method: CITab introduces a semantic-awareness tabular modeling mechanism using column headers as cues and a P-MoLin module for handling tabular data heterogeneity and exploring medical concepts.

Result: CITab outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis across three cohorts with 4,461 subjects, demonstrating effective cross-tabular learning.

Conclusion: CITab advances multi-modal SSL by enabling scalable, transferrable knowledge learning across diverse medical datasets, with promising performance in clinical tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning integrating medical images and tabular data has significantly advanced clinical decision-making in recent years. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining these models on large-scale unlabeled image-tabular data, aiming to learn discriminative representations. However, existing SSL methods for image-tabular representation learning are often confined to specific data cohorts, mainly due to their rigid tabular modeling mechanisms when modeling heterogeneous tabular data. This inter-tabular barrier hinders the multi-modal SSL methods from effectively learning transferrable medical knowledge shared across diverse cohorts. In this paper, we propose a novel SSL framework, namely CITab, designed to learn powerful multi-modal feature representations in a cross-tabular manner. We design the tabular modeling mechanism from a semantic-awareness perspective by integrating column headers as semantic cues, which facilitates transferrable knowledge learning and the scalability in utilizing multiple data sources for pretraining. Additionally, we propose a prototype-guided mixture-of-linear layer (P-MoLin) module for tabular feature specialization, empowering the model to effectively handle the heterogeneity of tabular data and explore the underlying medical concepts. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis task across three publicly available data cohorts containing 4,461 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that CITab outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for effective and scalable cross-tabular multi-modal learning.

*Jiaheng Li,Qiyu Dai,Lihan Li,Praneeth Chakravarthula,He Sun,Baoquan Chen,Wenzheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a learning-based framework for robust 3D imaging using single-shot structured light systems, outperforming traditional methods by leveraging neural feature matching and depth refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional structured light methods struggle with robustness under challenging conditions like occlusions and non-Lambertian surfaces. This work aims to improve performance by shifting from pixel-domain matching to feature-space matching.

Method: The proposed method uses neural feature extraction and cost volumes in feature space, along with a depth refinement module leveraging monocular depth priors. A synthetic dataset of nearly one million pattern-image pairs is also created for training.

Result: The framework generalizes well to real-world indoor environments, handles various pattern types without retraining, and outperforms commercial systems and passive stereo RGB-based methods.

Conclusion: The learning-based structured light decoding approach significantly enhances robustness and depth quality, demonstrating the potential of feature-space matching for 3D imaging.

Abstract: We consider the problem of active 3D imaging using single-shot structured light systems, which are widely employed in commercial 3D sensing devices such as Apple Face ID and Intel RealSense. Traditional structured light methods typically decode depth correspondences through pixel-domain matching algorithms, resulting in limited robustness under challenging scenarios like occlusions, fine-structured details, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Inspired by recent advances in neural feature matching, we propose a learning-based structured light decoding framework that performs robust correspondence matching within feature space rather than the fragile pixel domain. Our method extracts neural features from the projected patterns and captured infrared (IR) images, explicitly incorporating their geometric priors by building cost volumes in feature space, achieving substantial performance improvements over pixel-domain decoding approaches. To further enhance depth quality, we introduce a depth refinement module that leverages strong priors from large-scale monocular depth estimation models, improving fine detail recovery and global structural coherence. To facilitate effective learning, we develop a physically-based structured light rendering pipeline, generating nearly one million synthetic pattern-image pairs with diverse objects and materials for indoor settings. Experiments demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on synthetic data with multiple structured light patterns, generalizes well to real-world indoor environments, effectively processes various pattern types without retraining, and consistently outperforms both commercial structured light systems and passive stereo RGB-based depth estimation methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore SCR as a core implicit map representation in neural SLAM, offering efficiency, fast relocalization, and privacy benefits.

Method: Introduce a novel SCR architecture tailored for SLAM, integrating SCR into a live pipeline with sparse/dense feature support.

Result: Achieves strict real-time performance in neural implicit RGB-D SLAM, with competitive results on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SCR-based SLAM system is simple, flexible, and reliable in dynamic environments, advancing neural implicit SLAM capabilities.

Abstract: We present a novel neural RGB-D Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) system that learns an implicit map of the scene in real time. For the first time, we explore the use of Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) as the core implicit map representation in a neural SLAM pipeline, a paradigm that trains a lightweight network to directly map 2D image features to 3D global coordinates. SCR networks provide efficient, low-memory 3D map representations, enable extremely fast relocalization, and inherently preserve privacy, making them particularly suitable for neural implicit SLAM.
  Our system is the first one to achieve strict real-time in neural implicit RGB-D SLAM by relying on a SCR-based representation. We introduce a novel SCR architecture specifically tailored for this purpose and detail the critical design choices required to integrate SCR into a live SLAM pipeline. The resulting framework is simple yet flexible, seamlessly supporting both sparse and dense features, and operates reliably in dynamic environments without special adaptation. We evaluate our approach on established synthetic and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance against the state of the art. Project Page: https://github.com/ialzugaray/ace-slam

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASAP Textured Gaussians, a method combining adaptive sampling and anisotropic parameterization to improve memory efficiency and rendering quality in textured 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing textured Gaussian methods suffer from inefficient sampling in canonical space and uniform texture parameterization, leading to memory inefficiency and over-parameterization.

Method: The authors propose adaptive sampling based on Gaussian density distribution and error-driven anisotropic parameterization to allocate texture resources efficiently.

Result: The ASAP Textured Gaussians method achieves high-fidelity rendering with significantly fewer texture parameters, improving the quality-efficiency tradeoff.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies effectively address the limitations of current textured Gaussian methods, enhancing performance while reducing memory usage.

Abstract: Recent advances have equipped 3D Gaussian Splatting with texture parameterizations to capture spatially varying attributes, improving the performance of both appearance modeling and downstream tasks. However, the added texture parameters introduce significant memory efficiency challenges. Rather than proposing new texture formulations, we take a step back to examine the characteristics of existing textured Gaussian methods and identify two key limitations in common: (1) Textures are typically defined in canonical space, leading to inefficient sampling that wastes textures' capacity on low-contribution regions; and (2) texture parameterization is uniformly assigned across all Gaussians, regardless of their visual complexity, resulting in over-parameterization. In this work, we address these issues through two simple yet effective strategies: adaptive sampling based on the Gaussian density distribution and error-driven anisotropic parameterization that allocates texture resources according to rendering error. Our proposed ASAP Textured Gaussians, short for Adaptive Sampling and Anisotropic Parameterization, significantly improve the quality efficiency tradeoff, achieving high-fidelity rendering with far fewer texture parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartAgent introduces Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) for chart understanding, improving robustness without heavy reliance on textual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal models depend on textual annotations, limiting performance when key data is missing. ChartAgent aims to overcome this by mimicking human cognitive processes.

Method: ChartAgent decomposes chart analysis into steps using an extensible tool library (e.g., OCR, segmentation). It standardizes outputs into an Evidence Package for transparency.

Result: The framework enhances robustness in sparse annotation scenarios, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: ChartAgent offers a trustworthy, extensible solution for chart understanding, leveraging TIR for transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: With their high information density and intuitive readability, charts have become the de facto medium for data analysis and communication across disciplines. Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made notable progress in automated chart understanding, yet they remain heavily dependent on explicit textual annotations and the performance degrades markedly when key numerals are absent. To address this limitation, we introduce ChartAgent, a chart understanding framework grounded in Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Inspired by human cognition, ChartAgent decomposes complex chart analysis into a sequence of observable, replayable steps. Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions. Experiments show that ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings, offering a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible systems for chart understanding.

TL;DR: OmniDrive-R1 is an end-to-end Vision-Language Model framework for autonomous driving that integrates perception and reasoning via an interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism, improving reliability and accuracy without dense labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing reliability failures like object hallucination in VLMs used in autonomous driving due to ungrounded, text-based reasoning and decoupled perception-reasoning stages.

Method: Introduces OmniDrive-R1 with Reinforcement-driven visual grounding and Clip-GRPO algorithm for annotation-free, real-time cross-modal consistency.

Result: Significant improvements: reasoning score rose from 51.77% to 80.35%, and answer accuracy from 37.81% to 73.62%.

Conclusion: OmniDrive-R1 effectively unifies perception and reasoning, enhancing autonomous driving VLM reliability and performance.

Abstract: The deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving (AD) is critically hindered by reliability failures, most notably object hallucination. This failure stems from their reliance on ungrounded, text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.While existing multi-modal CoT approaches attempt mitigation, they suffer from two fundamental flaws: (1) decoupled perception and reasoning stages that prevent end-to-end joint optimization, and (2) reliance on expensive, dense localization labels.Thus we introduce OmniDrive-R1, an end-to-end VLM framework designed for autonomous driving, which unifies perception and reasoning through an interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism. Our core innovation is an Reinforcement-driven visual grounding capability, enabling the model to autonomously direct its attention and "zoom in" on critical regions for fine-grained analysis. This capability is enabled by our pure two-stage reinforcement learning training pipeline and Clip-GRPO algorithm. Crucially, Clip-GRPO introduces an annotation-free, process-based grounding reward. This reward not only eliminates the need for dense labels but also circumvents the instability of external tool calls by enforcing real-time cross-modal consistency between the visual focus and the textual reasoning. Extensive experiments on DriveLMM-o1 demonstrate our model's significant improvements. Compared to the baseline Qwen2.5VL-7B, OmniDrive-R1 improves the overall reasoning score from 51.77% to 80.35%, and the final answer accuracy from 37.81% to 73.62%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges like variable-length labels and misalignment in scene text datasets.

Method: Uses an image-text encoder and character-level tokenizer, with SSLC for error simulation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy and practical utility.

Conclusion: SELECT effectively detects label errors and improves scene text recognition accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce SELECT (Scene tExt Label Errors deteCTion), a novel approach that leverages multi-modal training to detect label errors in real-world scene text datasets. Utilizing an image-text encoder and a character-level tokenizer, SELECT addresses the issues of variable-length sequence labels, label sequence misalignment, and character-level errors, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and practical utility. In addition, we introduce Similarity-based Sequence Label Corruption (SSLC), a process that intentionally introduces errors into the training labels to mimic real-world error scenarios during training. SSLC not only can cause a change in the sequence length but also takes into account the visual similarity between characters during corruption. Our method is the first to detect label errors in real-world scene text datasets successfully accounting for variable-length labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SELECT in detecting label errors and improving STR accuracy on real-world text datasets, showcasing its practical utility.

TL;DR: HyperVL is an efficient multimodal LLM for on-device use, reducing latency and memory issues with adaptive resolution prediction and multi-scale encoder alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high computational and memory demands of multimodal LLMs for on-device deployment.

Method: Image-tiling strategy, Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC), and Dual Consistency Learning (DCL).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, reduces latency, and lowers power consumption.

Conclusion: HyperVL is practical for efficient on-device multimodal inference.

Abstract: Current multimodal large lanauge models possess strong perceptual and reasoning capabilities, however high computational and memory requirements make them difficult to deploy directly on on-device environments. While small-parameter models are progressively endowed with strong general capabilities, standard Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders remain a critical bottleneck, suffering from excessive latency and memory consumption when processing high-resolution inputs.To address these challenges, we introduce HyperVL, an efficient multimodal large language model tailored for on-device inference. HyperVL adopts an image-tiling strategy to cap peak memory usage and incorporates two novel techniques: (1) a Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC) that adaptively predicts optimal encoding resolutions to eliminate redundant computation, and (2) Dual Consistency Learning (DCL), which aligns multi-scale ViT encoders within a unified framework, enabling dynamic switching between visual branches under a shared LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperVL achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly significantly reduces latency and power consumption on real mobile devices, demonstrating its practicality for on-device multimodal inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disjointed study of talking face editing and generation by unifying them under a single framework.

Method: FacEDiT, a speech-conditional Diffusion Transformer with flow matching, learns to infill masked facial motions using surrounding motions and speech. Features biased attention and temporal smoothness for better continuity.

Result: FacEDiT enables localized edits (substitution, insertion, deletion) and seamless transitions, with strong identity preservation and lip sync. Introduces FacEDiTBench, a new dataset and metrics.

Conclusion: FacEDiT successfully unifies talking face editing and generation, achieving accurate, speech-aligned edits and smooth visual continuity.

Abstract: Talking face editing and face generation have often been studied as distinct problems. In this work, we propose viewing both not as separate tasks but as subtasks of a unifying formulation, speech-conditional facial motion infilling. We explore facial motion infilling as a self-supervised pretext task that also serves as a unifying formulation of dynamic talking face synthesis. To instantiate this idea, we propose FacEDiT, a speech-conditional Diffusion Transformer trained with flow matching. Inspired by masked autoencoders, FacEDiT learns to synthesize masked facial motions conditioned on surrounding motions and speech. This formulation enables both localized generation and edits, such as substitution, insertion, and deletion, while ensuring seamless transitions with unedited regions. In addition, biased attention and temporal smoothness constraints enhance boundary continuity and lip synchronization. To address the lack of a standard editing benchmark, we introduce FacEDiTBench, the first dataset for talking face editing, featuring diverse edit types and lengths, along with new evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments validate that talking face editing and generation emerge as subtasks of speech-conditional motion infilling; FacEDiT produces accurate, speech-aligned facial edits with strong identity preservation and smooth visual continuity while generalizing effectively to talking face generation.

TL;DR: A multimodal deep learning framework predicts real-time indoor workplane illuminance distributions using non-intrusive images, focusing on window areas for dynamic occupancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing indoor daylight prediction studies are limited to static scenes. This study addresses the gap by enabling accurate predictions in dynamically occupied spaces.

Method: The proposed framework uses multimodal deep learning to extract temporal-spatial features from window-lit areas in images, avoiding interior pixel reliance.

Result: The model showed high accuracy (R2 > 0.98, RMSE < 0.14) on same-distribution data and acceptable generalization (R2 > 0.82, RMSE < 0.17) on unseen-day data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively predicts indoor illuminance in real-time for dynamic spaces, offering potential energy savings through daylight-linked controls.

Abstract: Daylight-linked controls (DLCs) have significant potential for energy savings in buildings, especially when abundant daylight is available and indoor workplane illuminance can be accurately predicted in real time. Most existing studies on indoor daylight predictions were developed and tested for static scenes. This study proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts indoor workplane illuminance distributions in real time from non-intrusive images with temporal-spatial features. By extracting image features only from the side-lit window areas rather than interior pixels, the approach remains applicable in dynamically occupied indoor spaces. A field experiment was conducted in a test room in Guangzhou (China), where 17,344 samples were collected for model training and validation. The model achieved R2 > 0.98 with RMSE < 0.14 on the same-distribution test set and R2 > 0.82 with RMSE < 0.17 on an unseen-day test set, indicating high accuracy and acceptable temporal generalization.

*Hao Chen,Junyang Chen,Jinshan Pan,Jiangxin Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CODSR is a controllable one-step diffusion network for image super-resolution, addressing limitations like fidelity loss, insufficient generative activation, and text-semantic misalignment via LQ-guided modulation, region-adaptive priors, and text-matching guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current diffusion-based one-step methods in image super-resolution, particularly fidelity loss from compression, inadequate generative activation, and misaligned text prompts.

Method: Introduces CODSR with three key components: LQ-guided feature modulation, region-adaptive generative prior activation, and text-matching guidance.

Result: CODSR achieves superior perceptual quality and competitive fidelity efficiently in one-step inference.

Conclusion: CODSR effectively addresses critical limitations in diffusion-based super-resolution, offering high-quality results with efficient inference.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based one-step methods have shown remarkable progress in the field of image super-resolution, yet they remain constrained by three critical limitations: (1) inferior fidelity performance caused by the information loss from compression encoding of low-quality (LQ) inputs; (2) insufficient region-discriminative activation of generative priors; (3) misalignment between text prompts and their corresponding semantic regions. To address these limitations, we propose CODSR, a controllable one-step diffusion network for image super-resolution. First, we propose an LQ-guided feature modulation module that leverages original uncompressed information from LQ inputs to provide high-fidelity conditioning for the diffusion process. We then develop a region-adaptive generative prior activation method to effectively enhance perceptual richness without sacrificing local structural fidelity. Finally, we employ a text-matching guidance strategy to fully harness the conditioning potential of text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CODSR achieves superior perceptual quality and competitive fidelity compared with state-of-the-art methods with efficient one-step inference.

*Shuang Cheng,Yuhua Jiang,Zineng Zhou,Dawei Liu,Wang Tao,Linfeng Zhang,Biqing Qi,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDAR-VL is a block-wise discrete diffusion model for vision-language tasks, improving training efficiency and performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Block-wise discrete diffusion is promising for vision-language modeling but faces challenges like high training cost and instability. SDAR-VL addresses these limitations.

Method: SDAR-VL integrates asynchronous noise scheduling, effective mask ratio scaling, and a progressive beta noise curriculum for stable and efficient training.

Result: SDAR-VL outperforms conventional block diffusion and matches or surpasses autoregressive baselines on 21 benchmarks.

Conclusion: SDAR-VL establishes block-wise discrete diffusion as a practical and competitive backbone for vision-language understanding.

Abstract: Block-wise discrete diffusion offers an attractive balance between parallel generation and causal dependency modeling, making it a promising backbone for vision-language modeling. However, its practical adoption has been limited by high training cost, slow convergence, and instability, which have so far kept it behind strong autoregressive (AR) baselines. We present \textbf{SDAR-VL}, the first systematic application of block-wise discrete diffusion to large-scale vision-language understanding (VLU), together with an \emph{integrated framework for efficient and stable training}. This framework unifies three components: (1) \textbf{Asynchronous Block-wise Noise Scheduling} to diversify supervision within each batch; (2) \textbf{Effective Mask Ratio Scaling} for unbiased loss normalization under stochastic masking; and (3) a \textbf{Progressive Beta Noise Curriculum} that increases effective mask coverage while preserving corruption diversity. Experiments on 21 single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks show that SDAR-VL consistently improves \emph{training efficiency}, \emph{convergence stability}, and \emph{task performance} over conventional block diffusion. On this evaluation suite, SDAR-VL sets a new state of the art among diffusion-based vision-language models and, under matched settings, matches or surpasses strong AR baselines such as LLaVA-OneVision as well as the global diffusion baseline LLaDA-V, establishing block-wise diffusion as a practical backbone for VLU.

### [34] [GaussianPlant: Structure-aligned Gaussian Splatting for 3D Reconstruction of Plants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14087)
*Yang Yang,Risa Shinoda,Hiroaki Santo,Fumio Okura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianPlant introduces a hierarchical 3DGS representation to jointly recover plant appearance and internal structure from multi-view images, using structure primitives (StPs) for geometry and appearance primitives (ApPs) for visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods lack structural representations like plant branching patterns, limiting applications such as plant phenotyping.

Method: GaussianPlant disentangles structure (StPs) and appearance (ApPs). StPs model branches as cylinders and leaves as disks, while ApPs use 3D Gaussians for appearance. Both are jointly optimized via re-rendering loss and gradient flow.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity appearance reconstruction and accurate structural representation, enabling branch and leaf extraction.

Conclusion: GaussianPlant successfully combines appearance and structural recovery, enhancing applications like plant phenotyping.

Abstract: We present a method for jointly recovering the appearance and internal structure of botanical plants from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). While 3DGS exhibits robust reconstruction of scene appearance for novel-view synthesis, it lacks structural representations underlying those appearances (e.g., branching patterns of plants), which limits its applicability to tasks such as plant phenotyping. To achieve both high-fidelity appearance and structural reconstruction, we introduce GaussianPlant, a hierarchical 3DGS representation, which disentangles structure and appearance. Specifically, we employ structure primitives (StPs) to explicitly represent branch and leaf geometry, and appearance primitives (ApPs) to the plants' appearance using 3D Gaussians. StPs represent a simplified structure of the plant, i.e., modeling branches as cylinders and leaves as disks. To accurately distinguish the branches and leaves, StP's attributes (i.e., branches or leaves) are optimized in a self-organized manner. ApPs are bound to each StP to represent the appearance of branches or leaves as in conventional 3DGS. StPs and ApPs are jointly optimized using a re-rendering loss on the input multi-view images, as well as the gradient flow from ApP to StP using the binding correspondence information. We conduct experiments to qualitatively evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of both appearance and structure, as well as real-world experiments to qualitatively validate the practical performance. Experiments show that the GaussianPlant achieves both high-fidelity appearance reconstruction via ApPs and accurate structural reconstruction via StPs, enabling the extraction of branch structure and leaf instances.

TL;DR: ProtoFlow introduces interpretable dynamic scene graph prototypes for surgical workflow analysis, combining self-supervised pretraining with prototype-based fine-tuning, achieving robust performance even with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical AI progress is hindered by high annotation costs, data scarcity, and lack of interpretable models. Scene graphs offer potential but are underutilized.

Method: ProtoFlow uses a GNN encoder-decoder with self-supervised pretraining and prototype-based fine-tuning to model surgical interactions.

Result: Outperforms GNN baselines, excels in few-shot scenarios, and provides interpretable insights into surgical techniques and complications.

Conclusion: ProtoFlow advances transparent, reliable, and data-efficient AI for surgical applications, aiding clinical adoption in training and decision support.

Abstract: Purpose: Detailed surgical recognition is critical for advancing AI-assisted surgery, yet progress is hampered by high annotation costs, data scarcity, and a lack of interpretable models. While scene graphs offer a structured abstraction of surgical events, their full potential remains untapped. In this work, we introduce ProtoFlow, a novel framework that learns dynamic scene graph prototypes to model complex surgical workflows in an interpretable and robust manner.
  Methods: ProtoFlow leverages a graph neural network (GNN) encoder-decoder architecture that combines self-supervised pretraining for rich representation learning with a prototype-based fine-tuning stage. This process discovers and refines core prototypes that encapsulate recurring, clinically meaningful patterns of surgical interaction, forming an explainable foundation for workflow analysis.
  Results: We evaluate our approach on the fine-grained CAT-SG dataset. ProtoFlow not only outperforms standard GNN baselines in overall accuracy but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in limited-data, few-shot scenarios, maintaining strong performance when trained on as few as one surgical video. Our qualitative analyses further show that the learned prototypes successfully identify distinct surgical sub-techniques and provide clear, interpretable insights into workflow deviations and rare complications.
  Conclusion: By uniting robust representation learning with inherent explainability, ProtoFlow represents a significant step toward developing more transparent, reliable, and data-efficient AI systems, accelerating their potential for clinical adoption in surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow optimization.

*Nhi Nguyen,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Le Nguyen,Manuel Lage Cañellas,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quality-aware framework for reliable video-based respiratory rate estimation by integrating multiple signal sources and dynamically assessing their reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based respiratory rate estimation methods are unreliable due to inconsistent signal quality from different extraction techniques.

Method: The framework extracts ten signals from facial rPPG, upper-body motion, and deep learning pipelines, analyzes them using four spectral estimators, and trains machine learning models to predict accuracy or select reliable signals.

Result: Tests on three datasets show the framework reduces estimation errors compared to individual methods, with performance gains varying by dataset.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of quality-driven predictive modeling for scalable and generalizable video-based respiratory monitoring.

Abstract: Video-based respiratory rate (RR) estimation is often unreliable due to inconsistent signal quality across extraction methods. We present a predictive, quality-aware framework that integrates heterogeneous signal sources with dynamic assessment of reliability. Ten signals are extracted from facial remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), upper-body motion, and deep learning pipelines, and analyzed using four spectral estimators: Welch's method, Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and peak detection. Segment-level quality indices are then used to train machine learning models that predict accuracy or select the most reliable signal. This enables adaptive signal fusion and quality-based segment filtering. Experiments on three public datasets (OMuSense-23, COHFACE, MAHNOB-HCI) show that the proposed framework achieves lower RR estimation errors than individual methods in most cases, with performance gains depending on dataset characteristics. These findings highlight the potential of quality-driven predictive modeling to deliver scalable and generalizable video-based respiratory monitoring solutions.

*Sisi Dai,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnchorHOI addresses 4D HOI generation limitations by using hybrid priors and anchor-based distillation for better interaction and motion synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale 4D HOI datasets limits supervised methods, and existing zero-shot approaches fail to adequately capture interaction cues.

Method: AnchorHOI combines video diffusion models with anchor-based distillation, using anchor NeRFs and keypoints for interaction composition and motion synthesis.

Result: AnchorHOI outperforms previous methods, achieving superior diversity and generalization in 4D HOI generation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages hybrid priors and anchor-based strategies to advance 4D HOI generation.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-driven 4D human-object interaction (HOI) generation with supervised methods, the scalability remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. To overcome this, recent approaches attempt zero-shot 4D HOI generation with pre-trained image diffusion models. However, interaction cues are minimally distilled during the generation process, restricting their applicability across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnchorHOI, a novel framework that thoroughly exploits hybrid priors by incorporating video diffusion models beyond image diffusion models, advancing 4D HOI generation. Nevertheless, directly optimizing high-dimensional 4D HOI with such priors remains challenging, particularly for human pose and compositional motion. To address this challenge, AnchorHOI introduces an anchor-based prior distillation strategy, which constructs interaction-aware anchors and then leverages them to guide generation in a tractable two-step process. Specifically, two tailored anchors are designed for 4D HOI generation: anchor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for expressive interaction composition, and anchor keypoints for realistic motion synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorHOI outperforms previous methods with superior diversity and generalization.

### [38] [OUSAC: Optimized Guidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching for DiT Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14096)
*Ruitong Sun,Tianze Yang,Wei Niu,Jin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OUSAC accelerates diffusion transformers by optimizing guidance scales and adaptive caching, reducing computation by up to 82% while improving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally expensive, and while CFG improves quality, it doubles computation. OUSAC aims to optimize this trade-off.

Method: OUSAC uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize guidance scales and introduces adaptive rank allocation for caching under variable guidance.

Result: OUSAC achieves up to 53% computational savings, 15% quality improvement, and 5x speedup while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: OUSAC effectively balances computational efficiency and generation quality in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-quality image generation, yet their computational expense remains substantial due to iterative denoising. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes. Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block, maintaining caching effectiveness under variable guidance. Experiments demonstrate that OUSAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, achieving 53% computational savings with 15% quality improvement on DiT-XL/2 (ImageNet 512x512), 60% savings with 16.1% improvement on PixArt-alpha (MSCOCO), and 5x speedup on FLUX while improving CLIP Score over the 50-step baseline.

TL;DR: ViewMask-1-to-3 is a discrete diffusion model for multi-view image generation from a single image and text, achieving cross-view consistency without complex 3D constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view image generation from a single image and text is challenging due to geometric inconsistency. Existing methods rely on complex 3D-aware architectures or specialized diffusion models, which require extensive data and priors.

Method: ViewMask-1-to-3 formulates multi-view synthesis as a discrete sequence modeling problem, using visual tokens from MAGVIT-v2 tokenization. It employs masked token prediction with text input and achieves consistency via random masking and self-attention.

Result: The method ranks first on GSO and 3D-FUTURE datasets for PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, outperforming existing approaches while maintaining simplicity.

Conclusion: Discrete diffusion via ViewMask-1-to-3 provides a simpler, effective alternative to current multi-view generation methods, demonstrating strong performance without complex 3D constraints.

Abstract: Multi-view image generation from a single image and text description remains challenging due to the difficulty of maintaining geometric consistency across different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically rely on 3D-aware architectures or specialized diffusion models that require extensive multi-view training data and complex geometric priors. In this work, we introduce ViewMask-1-to-3, a pioneering approach to apply discrete diffusion models to multi-view image generation. Unlike continuous diffusion methods that operate in latent spaces, ViewMask-1-to-3 formulates multi-view synthesis as a discrete sequence modeling problem, where each viewpoint is represented as visual tokens obtained through MAGVIT-v2 tokenization. By unifying language and vision through masked token prediction, our approach enables progressive generation of multiple viewpoints through iterative token unmasking with text input. ViewMask-1-to-3 achieves cross-view consistency through simple random masking combined with self-attention, eliminating the requirement for complex 3D geometric constraints or specialized attention architectures. Our approach demonstrates that discrete diffusion provides a viable and simple alternative to existing multi-view generation methods, ranking first on average across GSO and 3D-FUTURE datasets in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, while maintaining architectural simplicity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUNE combines LLMs and neurosymbolic AI for explicit reasoning in RS text-to-image retrieval, outperforming RS-LVLMs in complex tasks with better performance, robustness, and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations in RS-LVLMs.

Method: Combine LLMs with neurosymbolic AI, using FOL expressions derived from text queries and a logic decomposition strategy for scalability.

Result: RUNE outperforms RS-LVLMs, showing superior performance, robustness, and explainability, validated on a repurposed DOTA dataset.

Conclusion: RUNE offers potential for real-world RS applications, demonstrated through a post-flood satellite image retrieval use case.

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval in remote sensing (RS) has advanced rapidly with the rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) tailored for aerial and satellite imagery, culminating in remote sensing large vision-language models (RS-LVLMS). However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty. RUNE outperforms joint-embedding models in complex RS retrieval tasks, offering gains in performance, robustness, and explainability. We show RUNE's potential for real-world RS applications through a use case on post-flood satellite image retrieval.

*Ashish Mishra,Gyanaranjan Nayak,Tarun Kumar,Arpit Shah,Suparna Bhattacharya,Martin Foltin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel training- and data-free unlearning framework for pretrained models like CLIP, enabling selective forgetting of objects or domains without retraining or additional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for removing specific object classes or domain knowledge from pretrained models without affecting unrelated tasks or requiring retraining.

Method: Leverages a multimodal nullspace using text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes from CLIP's joint embedding space to remove undesired class information.

Result: Efficiently removes unwanted knowledge while preserving the model's performance on unrelated tasks, offering a flexible and computationally efficient solution.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a practical and efficient approach for controlled model forgetting, overcoming the limitations of existing retraining-based methods.

Abstract: Pretrained models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification capabilities across diverse visual domains, spanning natural images, artistic renderings, and abstract representations. However, real-world applications often demand the removal (or "unlearning") of specific object classes without requiring additional data or retraining, or affecting the model's performance on unrelated tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel training- and data-free unlearning framework that enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: (1) global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, (2) domain-specific knowledge removal (e.g., eliminating sketch representations while preserving photo recognition), and (3) complete unlearning in selective domains. By leveraging a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space, our method efficiently removes undesired class information while preserving the remaining knowledge. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing retraining-based methods and offers a flexible and computationally efficient solution for controlled model forgetting.

TL;DR: MFE-GAN is proposed to reduce training and inference times for document image enhancement and binarization by incorporating Haar wavelet transformation and multi-scale features, achieving comparable performance to SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly recognizing text in degraded documents is inefficient; existing multi-GAN methods are time-consuming.

Method: MFE-GAN uses Haar wavelet transformation, normalization, and novel generators/discriminators with multi-scale feature extraction.

Result: MFE-GAN reduces training/inference times while maintaining performance on Benchmark, Nabuco, and CMATERdb datasets.

Conclusion: MFE-GAN offers an efficient alternative to multi-GAN methods for document enhancement and binarization.

Abstract: Document image enhancement and binarization are commonly performed prior to document analysis and recognition tasks for improving the efficiency and accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) systems. This is because directly recognizing text in degraded documents, particularly in color images, often results in unsatisfactory recognition performance. To address these issues, existing methods train independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for different color channels to remove shadows and noise, which, in turn, facilitates efficient text information extraction. However, deploying multiple GANs results in long training and inference times. To reduce both training and inference times of document image enhancement and binarization models, we propose MFE-GAN, an efficient GAN-based framework with multi-scale feature extraction (MFE), which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation (HWT) and normalization to process document images before feeding them into GANs for training. In addition, we present novel generators, discriminators, and loss functions to improve the model's performance, and we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate their effectiveness. Experimental results on the Benchmark, Nabuco, and CMATERdb datasets demonstrate that the proposed MFE-GAN significantly reduces the total training and inference times while maintaining comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The implementation of this work is available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/MFE-GAN.

Motivation: To address limitations of discrete tracking and view-dependent features in dynamic scene understanding.

Method: Models space-time points with occupancy probabilities and conditional instance distributions using deformable 3D Gaussians, learning from RGB and instance masks.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on novel-view panoptic segmentation and 4D querying tasks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively disentangles visibility from object identity, achieving consistent dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: We introduce Consistent Instance Field, a continuous and probabilistic spatio-temporal representation for dynamic scene understanding. Unlike prior methods that rely on discrete tracking or view-dependent features, our approach disentangles visibility from persistent object identity by modeling each space-time point with an occupancy probability and a conditional instance distribution. To realize this, we introduce a novel instance-embedded representation based on deformable 3D Gaussians, which jointly encode radiance and semantic information and are learned directly from input RGB images and instance masks through differentiable rasterization. Furthermore, we introduce new mechanisms to calibrate per-Gaussian identities and resample Gaussians toward semantically active regions, ensuring consistent instance representations across space and time. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on novel-view panoptic segmentation and open-vocabulary 4D querying tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and data dependency of traditional unlearning techniques, aiming for a precise and computationally efficient solution for model decontamination and privacy.

Method: Leverages nullspace projection to compute an orthonormal basis for target text embeddings, projecting these directions to erase unwanted class alignments without retraining.

Result: Significant drop in zero-shot performance for target classes while preserving overall model knowledge, with partial projection offering a balance between unlearning and retention.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient, precise alternative to traditional unlearning, addressing privacy and decontamination challenges in multimodal models.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, closed-form approach for selective unlearning in multimodal models, specifically targeting pretrained models such as CLIP. Our method leverages nullspace projection to erase the target class information embedded in the final projection layer, without requiring any retraining or the use of images from the forget set. By computing an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by target text embeddings and projecting these directions, we dramatically reduce the alignment between image features and undesired classes. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that rely on iterative fine-tuning and extensive data curation, our approach is both computationally efficient and surgically precise. This leads to a pronounced drop in zero-shot performance for the target classes while preserving the overall multimodal knowledge of the model. Our experiments demonstrate that even a partial projection can balance between complete unlearning and retaining useful information, addressing key challenges in model decontamination and privacy preservation.

TL;DR: SketchAssist is an interactive tool combining instruction-guided global edits and line-guided local redrawing for sketches, using a novel data pipeline and DiT-based framework for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch editing tools fail to balance semantic changes with precision and style preservation, necessitating a unified solution.

Method: SketchAssist uses a controllable data pipeline for attribute-addition sequences and edit chains, integrates a DiT-based framework with RGB channel inputs, and employs a task-guided mixture-of-experts in LoRA layers.

Result: SketchAssist achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence and style/structure preservation compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SketchAssist, supported by its scalable dataset, offers a practical and controllable solution for sketch creation and editing.

Abstract: Sketch editing is central to digital illustration, yet existing image editing systems struggle to preserve the sparse, style-sensitive structure of line art while supporting both high-level semantic changes and precise local redrawing. We present SketchAssist, an interactive sketch drawing assistant that accelerates creation by unifying instruction-guided global edits with line-guided region redrawing, while keeping unrelated regions and overall composition intact. To enable this assistant at scale, we introduce a controllable data generation pipeline that (i) constructs attribute-addition sequences from attribute-free base sketches, (ii) forms multi-step edit chains via cross-sequence sampling, and (iii) expands stylistic coverage with a style-preserving attribute-removal model applied to diverse sketches. Building on this data, SketchAssist employs a unified sketch editing framework with minimal changes to DiT-based editors. We repurpose the RGB channels to encode the inputs, enabling seamless switching between instruction-guided edits and line-guided redrawing within a single input interface. To further specialize behavior across modes, we integrate a task-guided mixture-of-experts into LoRA layers, routing by text and visual cues to improve semantic controllability, structural fidelity, and style preservation. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on both tasks, with superior instruction adherence and style/structure preservation compared to recent baselines. Together, our dataset and SketchAssist provide a practical, controllable assistant for sketch creation and revision.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying performance anti-patterns in ML models is resource-intensive and often inaccessible to computer vision researchers due to the lack of expertise and automated tools.

Method: A lightweight ML model detects problematic trace segments, followed by an LLM for fine-grained classification and feedback, leveraging a new benchmark dataset of 600+ PyTorch traces.

Result: The method outperforms unsupervised clustering and rule-based techniques, effectively compensating for LLMs' context length and reasoning limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient, automated solution for detecting anti-patterns in ML traces, making it accessible to a broader research community.

Abstract: Identifying and addressing performance anti-patterns in machine learning (ML) models is critical for efficient training and inference, but it typically demands deep expertise spanning system infrastructure, ML models and kernel development. While large tech companies rely on dedicated ML infrastructure engineers to analyze torch traces and benchmarks, such resource-intensive workflows are largely inaccessible to computer vision researchers in general. Among the challenges, pinpointing problematic trace segments within lengthy execution traces remains the most time-consuming task, and is difficult to automate with current ML models, including LLMs. In this work, we present the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate and improve ML models' ability to detect anti patterns in traces. Our dataset contains over 600 PyTorch traces from diverse computer vision models classification, detection, segmentation, and generation collected across multiple hardware platforms. We also propose a novel iterative approach: a lightweight ML model first detects trace segments with anti patterns, followed by a large language model (LLM) for fine grained classification and targeted feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms unsupervised clustering and rule based statistical techniques for detecting anti pattern regions. Our method also effectively compensates LLM's limited context length and reasoning inefficiencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks rely on single-trigger-single-object mappings and fragile pixel-level cues, limiting their capability and robustness. CIS-BA addresses these limitations by focusing on interaction patterns.

Method: CIS-BA models inter-object interactions as a continuous space, using space triggers for multi-trigger-multi-object attacks. CIS-Frame constructs these triggers via interaction analysis, formalizes them as constraints for poisoning, and embeds the backdoor during training.

Result: Experiments show over 97% attack success in complex environments and over 95% effectiveness under dynamic multi-trigger conditions, while evading state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: CIS-BA advances backdoor attacks in interaction-intensive scenarios and offers new insights into object detection security.

Abstract: Object detection models deployed in real-world applications such as autonomous driving face serious threats from backdoor attacks. Despite their practical effectiveness,existing methods are inherently limited in both capability and robustness due to their dependence on single-trigger-single-object mappings and fragile pixel-level cues. We propose CIS-BA, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that redefines trigger design by shifting from static object features to continuous inter-object interaction patterns that describe how objects co-occur and interact in a scene. By modeling these patterns as a continuous interaction space, CIS-BA introduces space triggers that, for the first time, enable a multi-trigger-multi-object attack mechanism while achieving robustness through invariant geometric relations. To implement this paradigm, we design CIS-Frame, which constructs space triggers via interaction analysis, formalizes them as class-geometry constraints for sample poisoning, and embeds the backdoor during detector training. CIS-Frame supports both single-object attacks (object misclassification and disappearance) and multi-object simultaneous attacks, enabling complex and coordinated effects across diverse interaction states. Experiments on MS-COCO and real-world videos show that CIS-BA achieves over 97% attack success under complex environments and maintains over 95% effectiveness under dynamic multi-trigger conditions, while evading three state-of-the-art defenses. In summary, CIS-BA extends the landscape of backdoor attacks in interaction-intensive scenarios and provides new insights into the security of object detection systems.

TL;DR: Fast3DHPE is a modular framework for fair comparison and efficient training in 3D human pose estimation, featuring FastDDHPose, a disentangled diffusion-based method that achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human pose estimation methods lack a unified framework for fair comparison and efficient training.

Method: Proposes Fast3DHPE, a standardized framework, and FastDDHPose, a diffusion-based method modeling bone length and direction distributions, with an efficient denoiser.

Result: Fast3DHPE improves training efficiency and enables fair comparisons; FastDDHPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

Conclusion: The Fast3DHPE framework and FastDDHPose method address limitations in 3D pose estimation, offering robust and generalizable solutions.

Abstract: Recent approaches for monocular 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) have achieved leading performance by directly regressing 3D poses from 2D keypoint sequences. Despite the rapid progress in 3D HPE, existing methods are typically trained and evaluated under disparate frameworks, lacking a unified framework for fair comparison. To address these limitations, we propose Fast3DHPE, a modular framework that facilitates rapid reproduction and flexible development of new methods. By standardizing training and evaluation protocols, Fast3DHPE enables fair comparison across 3D human pose estimation methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this framework, we introduce FastDDHPose, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method which leverages the strong latent distribution modeling capability of diffusion models to explicitly model the distributions of bone length and bone direction while avoiding further amplification of hierarchical error accumulation. Moreover, we design an efficient Kinematic-Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser that encourages the model to focus on kinematic joint hierarchies while avoiding unnecessary modeling of overly complex joint topologies. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that the Fast3DHPE framework enables fair comparison of all methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this unified framework, FastDDHPose achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization and robustness in in-the-wild scenarios. The framework and models will be released at: https://github.com/Andyen512/Fast3DHPE

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU) is a Bayesian framework for robust uncertainty estimation in LVLMs, outperforming existing methods by analyzing answer embeddings' geometric structure without fragile clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic uncertainty methods in LVLMs rely on unreliable clustering techniques, leading to inconsistent outputs. SGPU aims to improve uncertainty estimation by avoiding these pitfalls.

Method: SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes their Gram matrix, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum. A Gaussian Process Classifier then maps semantic consistency patterns to predictive uncertainty.

Result: SGPU achieves state-of-the-art calibration and discriminative performance across six LVLMs on eight datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SGPU provides a reliable, transferable solution for semantic uncertainty estimation in LVLMs, capturing general patterns of uncertainty.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often produce plausible but unreliable outputs, making robust uncertainty estimation essential. Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum. This spectral representation is then fed into a Gaussian Process Classifier that learns to map patterns of semantic consistency to predictive uncertainty, and that can be applied in both black-box and white-box settings. Across six LLMs and LVLMs on eight datasets spanning VQA, image classification, and textual QA, SGPU consistently achieves state-of-the-art calibration (ECE) and discriminative (AUROC, AUARC) performance. We further show that SGPU transfers across models and modalities, indicating that its spectral representation captures general patterns of semantic uncertainty.

*Francesco Di Sario,Daniel Rebain,Dor Verbin,Marco Grangetto,Andrea Tagliasacchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a novel framework for appearance modeling in radiance field methods, addressing limitations of Spherical Harmonics (SH) like high-frequency signal handling and specular reflections. SV provides a simpler, more intuitive, and efficient solution with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spherical Harmonics (SH) used in radiance field methods have limitations in handling high-frequency signals and specular reflections, motivating the search for better alternatives like Spherical Voronoi (SV).

Method: The paper proposes SV as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, simplifying optimization while capturing view-dependent effects effectively.

Result: SV achieves competitive results for diffuse appearance and state-of-the-art performance for reflections, outperforming SH on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SV provides a principled, efficient, and general solution for appearance modeling in explicit 3D representations, addressing SH's limitations without added complexity.

Abstract: Radiance field methods (e.g. 3D Gaussian Splatting) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet their appearance modeling often relies on Spherical Harmonics (SH), which impose fundamental limitations. SH struggle with high-frequency signals, exhibit Gibbs ringing artifacts, and fail to capture specular reflections - a key component of realistic rendering. Although alternatives like spherical Gaussians offer improvements, they add significant optimization complexity. We propose Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, providing an intuitive and stable parameterization for view-dependent effects. For diffuse appearance, SV achieves competitive results while keeping optimization simpler than existing alternatives. For reflections - where SH fail - we leverage SV as learnable reflection probes, taking reflected directions as input following principles from classical graphics. This formulation attains state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that SV offers a principled, efficient, and general solution for appearance modeling in explicit 3D representations.

TL;DR: Proposed method improves fracture morphology diagnosis by automating global AO code assignment, boosting F1 scores by 7.89%, though real-world use faces detector challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fractures affect 15-45% of children, necessitating accurate diagnosis. Current methods rely on fracture morphology, location, and angle, prompting a need for automated, reliable tools.

Method: Automates global AO code assignment to fracture bounding boxes, allowing public dataset use and converting a multilabel task into a multiclass one.

Result: Achieves a 7.89% average F1 score improvement, but performance drops with imperfect detectors, indicating real-world deployment hurdles.

Conclusion: The method enhances fracture diagnosis accuracy but faces limitations in practical scenarios due to detector imperfections.

Abstract: Between $15\,\%$ and $45\,\%$ of children experience a fracture during their growth years, making accurate diagnosis essential. Fracture morphology, alongside location and fragment angle, is a key diagnostic feature. In this work, we propose a method to extract fracture morphology by assigning automatically global AO codes to corresponding fracture bounding boxes. This approach enables the use of public datasets and reformulates the global multilabel task into a local multiclass one, improving the average F1 score by $7.89\,\%$. However, performance declines when using imperfect fracture detectors, highlighting challenges for real-world deployment. Our code is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SkyLume, a UAV dataset designed to address illumination inconsistencies in multi-temporal 3D reconstruction, featuring 100k+ images, LiDAR scans, and a new metric (TCC) for robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV datasets lack systematic multi-temporal illumination data, causing color and geometric artifacts in reconstruction. SkyLume fills this gap to advance robust 3D modeling.

Method: SkyLume includes 10 urban regions captured at three times of day (100k+ images), LiDAR scans, and introduces the TCC metric for albedo stability evaluation.

Result: The dataset enables precise assessment of geometry, appearance, and illumination disentanglement, supporting tasks like inverse rendering and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: SkyLume aims to advance research in illumination-robust 3D reconstruction, providing a foundation for real-world evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated strong potential for large-scale UAV-based 3D reconstruction tasks by fitting the appearance of images. However, real-world large-scale captures are often based on multi-temporal data capture, where illumination inconsistencies across different times of day can significantly lead to color artifacts, geometric inaccuracies, and inconsistent appearance. Due to the lack of UAV datasets that systematically capture the same areas under varying illumination conditions, this challenge remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduceSkyLume, a large-scale, real-world UAV dataset specifically designed for studying illumination robust 3D reconstruction in urban scene modeling: (1) We collect data from 10 urban regions data comprising more than 100k high resolution UAV images (four oblique views and nadir), where each region is captured at three periods of the day to systematically isolate illumination changes. (2) To support precise evaluation of geometry and appearance, we provide per-scene LiDAR scans and accurate 3D ground-truth for assessing depth, surface normals, and reconstruction quality under varying illumination. (3) For the inverse rendering task, we introduce the Temporal Consistency Coefficient (TCC), a metric that measuress cross-time albedo stability and directly evaluates the robustness of the disentanglement of light and material. We aim for this resource to serve as a foundation that advances research and real-world evaluation in large-scale inverse rendering, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis.

TL;DR: DRAW2ACT is a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework for robotic manipulation, enhancing controllability and consistency by leveraging multiple trajectory representations and generating aligned RGB and depth videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models lack controllability for robotic manipulation, and existing trajectory-conditioned methods are limited by 2D trajectories or single-modality conditioning.

Method: DRAW2ACT extracts multiple orthogonal representations from trajectories (depth, semantics, shape, motion) and injects them into a diffusion model. It jointly generates aligned RGB and depth videos, using cross-modality attention and depth supervision.

Result: Experiments show DRAW2ACT achieves higher visual fidelity, consistency, and manipulation success rates on benchmarks like Bridge V2 and Berkeley Autolab.

Conclusion: DRAW2ACT improves robotic manipulation by integrating depth-aware trajectory conditioning and multimodal video generation.

Abstract: Video diffusion models provide powerful real-world simulators for embodied AI but remain limited in controllability for robotic manipulation. Recent works on trajectory-conditioned video generation address this gap but often rely on 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, which restricts their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations. We present DRAW2ACT, a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework that extracts multiple orthogonal representations from the input trajectory, capturing depth, semantics, shape and motion, and injects them into the diffusion model. Moreover, we propose to jointly generate spatially aligned RGB and depth videos, leveraging cross-modality attention mechanisms and depth supervision to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce a multimodal policy model conditioned on the generated RGB and depth sequences to regress the robot's joint angles. Experiments on Bridge V2, Berkeley Autolab, and simulation benchmarks show that DRAW2ACT achieves superior visual fidelity and consistency while yielding higher manipulation success rates compared to existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HETT, a framework for Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (AVLN) that combines global reasoning and local scene analysis using a two-stage transformer approach, achieving improved performance on the refined CityNav dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV navigation frameworks struggle to balance global environmental reasoning and local scene comprehension, limiting their effectiveness in large-scale urban environments.

Method: The proposed HETT framework uses a coarse-to-fine pipeline: first predicting coarse-grained target positions by fusing spatial landmarks and historical context, then refining actions via fine-grained visual analysis. A historical grid map is also introduced to enhance spatial memory.

Result: HETT achieves significant performance gains on the refined CityNav dataset, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: The HETT framework successfully integrates global and local navigation aspects, demonstrating improved performance and confirming the value of its design components.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (AVLN) requires Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) agents to localize targets in large-scale urban environments based on linguistic instructions. While successful navigation demands both global environmental reasoning and local scene comprehension, existing UAV agents typically adopt mono-granularity frameworks that struggle to balance these two aspects. To address this limitation, this work proposes a History-Enhanced Two-Stage Transformer (HETT) framework, which integrates the two aspects through a coarse-to-fine navigation pipeline. Specifically, HETT first predicts coarse-grained target positions by fusing spatial landmarks and historical context, then refines actions via fine-grained visual analysis. In addition, a historical grid map is designed to dynamically aggregate visual features into a structured spatial memory, enhancing comprehensive scene awareness. Additionally, the CityNav dataset annotations are manually refined to enhance data quality. Experiments on the refined CityNav dataset show that HETT delivers significant performance gains, while extensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each component.

Result: Achieves desired performance in unified multimodal sensor data generation, ensuring consistency and flexible adjustments.

Conclusion: OminiGen effectively addresses the challenges of multimodal data generation, offering a robust solution for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by extensive real-world data collection. However, acquiring diverse and corner-case data remains costly and inefficient. Generative models have emerged as a promising solution by synthesizing realistic sensor data. However, existing approaches primarily focus on single-modality generation, leading to inefficiencies and misalignment in multimodal sensor data. To address these challenges, we propose OminiGen, which generates aligned multimodal sensor data in a unified framework. Our approach leverages a shared Bird\u2019s Eye View (BEV) space to unify multimodal features and designs a novel generalizable multimodal reconstruction method, UAE, to jointly decode LiDAR and multi-view camera data. UAE achieves multimodal sensor decoding through volume rendering, enabling accurate and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we incorporate a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with a ControlNet branch to enable controllable multimodal sensor generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OminiGen achieves desired performances in unified multimodal sensor data generation with multimodal consistency and flexible sensor adjustments.

Motivation: To replace invasive brain tumor biopsies for MGMT promoter methylation detection with a non-invasive, efficient radiogenomics method.

Method: Uses MRI scans and a multi-view deep learning model to analyze spatial relationships between MRI views, introducing a novel tumor slice extraction technique.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, offering a reproducible pipeline for transparency and robust diagnostics.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of non-invasive radiogenomics in precision medicine for GBM treatment, advancing diagnostic tools.

Abstract: The presence of MGMT promoter methylation significantly affects how well chemotherapy works for patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). Currently, confirmation of MGMT promoter methylation relies on invasive brain tumor tissue biopsies. In this study, we explore radiogenomics techniques, a promising approach in precision medicine, to identify genetic markers from medical images. Using MRI scans and deep learning models, we propose a new multi-view approach that considers spatial relationships between MRI views to detect MGMT methylation status. Importantly, our method extracts information from all three views without using a complicated 3D deep learning model, avoiding issues associated with high parameter count, slow convergence, and substantial memory demands. We also introduce a new technique for tumor slice extraction and show its superiority over existing methods based on multiple evaluation metrics. By comparing our approach to state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Furthermore, we share a reproducible pipeline of published models, encouraging transparency and the development of robust diagnostic tools. Our study highlights the potential of non-invasive methods for identifying MGMT promoter methylation and contributes to advancing precision medicine in GBM treatment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViBES is a conversational 3D agent that jointly plans language and movement using a multimodal model, enabling socially competent and controllable interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior systems treat human behavior as isolated tasks without agentic decision-making, leading to poor timing and weak social grounding. ViBES aims to integrate language, prosody, and movement for more natural interactions.

Method: ViBES uses a mixture-of-modality-experts (MoME) backbone, with partitioned transformer experts for speech, facial expression, and body motion. It processes multimodal token streams with hard routing and cross-expert attention.

Result: ViBES outperforms baselines in automatic metrics for dialogue-motion alignment and behavior quality, supporting mixed-initiative interaction with controllable behavior hooks.

Conclusion: ViBES advances beyond speech-conditioned motion generation by jointly generating language, prosody, and movement, enabling socially competent 3D interaction.

Abstract: Human communication is inherently multimodal and social: words, prosody, and body language jointly carry intent. Yet most prior systems model human behavior as a translation task co-speech gesture or text-to-motion that maps a fixed utterance to motion clips-without requiring agentic decision-making about when to move, what to do, or how to adapt across multi-turn dialogue. This leads to brittle timing, weak social grounding, and fragmented stacks where speech, text, and motion are trained or inferred in isolation. We introduce ViBES (Voice in Behavioral Expression and Synchrony), a conversational 3D agent that jointly plans language and movement and executes dialogue-conditioned body actions. Concretely, ViBES is a speech-language-behavior (SLB) model with a mixture-of-modality-experts (MoME) backbone: modality-partitioned transformer experts for speech, facial expression, and body motion. The model processes interleaved multimodal token streams with hard routing by modality (parameters are split per expert), while sharing information through cross-expert attention. By leveraging strong pretrained speech-language models, the agent supports mixed-initiative interaction: users can speak, type, or issue body-action directives mid-conversation, and the system exposes controllable behavior hooks for streaming responses. We further benchmark on multi-turn conversation with automatic metrics of dialogue-motion alignment and behavior quality, and observe consistent gains over strong co-speech and text-to-motion baselines. ViBES goes beyond "speech-conditioned motion generation" toward agentic virtual bodies where language, prosody, and movement are jointly generated, enabling controllable, socially competent 3D interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated radar data hinders radar-based perception systems. The goal is to overcome this by generating realistic synthetic radar data.

Method: 4D-RaDiff applies diffusion to latent point cloud representations, considering radar sparsity. It converts unlabeled bounding boxes into radar annotations and transforms LiDAR data into radar scenes.

Result: Synthetic radar data improves object detection performance and reduces the need for real annotated data by up to 90%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data scarcity, enhancing radar-based perception systems.

Abstract: Automotive radar has shown promising developments in environment perception due to its cost-effectiveness and robustness in adverse weather conditions. However, the limited availability of annotated radar data poses a significant challenge for advancing radar-based perception systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework to generate 4D radar point clouds for training and evaluating object detectors. Unlike image-based diffusion, our method is designed to consider the sparsity and unique characteristics of radar point clouds by applying diffusion to a latent point cloud representation. Within this latent space, generation is controlled via conditioning at either the object or scene level. The proposed 4D-RaDiff converts unlabeled bounding boxes into high-quality radar annotations and transforms existing LiDAR point cloud data into realistic radar scenes. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating synthetic radar data of 4D-RaDiff as data augmentation method during training consistently improves object detection performance compared to training on real data only. In addition, pre-training on our synthetic data reduces the amount of required annotated radar data by up to 90% while achieving comparable object detection performance.

Abstract: The growing demand for immersive 3D content calls for automated monocular-to-stereo video conversion. We present Elastic3D, a controllable, direct end-to-end method for upgrading a conventional video to a binocular one. Our approach, based on (conditional) latent diffusion, avoids artifacts due to explicit depth estimation and warping. The key to its high-quality stereo video output is a novel, guided VAE decoder that ensures sharp and epipolar-consistent stereo video output. Moreover, our method gives the user control over the strength of the stereo effect (more precisely, the disparity range) at inference time, via an intuitive, scalar tuning knob.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VP improvements focus on program quality but ignore optimizing pre-trained sub-task modules, hindered by lack of sub-task labels and VP's non-differentiability.

Method: EVPG builds a directed probabilistic graph from VP's variable dependencies, reconstructing execution as differentiable probability inference.

Result: EVPG significantly boosts VP performance on GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images tasks.

Conclusion: EVPG's probabilistic graph approach enables effective gradient-based optimization for VP, advancing complex visual reasoning.

Abstract: Recently, Visual Programming (VP) based on large language models (LLMs) has rapidly developed and demonstrated significant potential in complex Visual Reasoning (VR) tasks. Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our EVPG, showing significant performance improvements for VP on three classical complex VR tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images.

Motivation: Existing driver attention prediction methods lack comprehensive spatial context due to narrow field-of-view and limited driving diversity, hindering performance in scenarios like lane changes and interactions with peripheral objects.

Method: The authors propose DriverGaze360-Net, which jointly learns attention maps and attended objects using an auxiliary semantic segmentation head for improved spatial awareness in panoramic driving images.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DriverGaze360-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in driver attention prediction across multiple metrics on panoramic images.

Conclusion: DriverGaze360 and DriverGaze360-Net address limitations in existing works by providing a comprehensive dataset and method for modeling driver gaze behavior in 360° driving environments.

Abstract: Predicting driver attention is a critical problem for developing explainable autonomous driving systems and understanding driver behavior in mixed human-autonomous vehicle traffic scenarios. Although significant progress has been made through large-scale driver attention datasets and deep learning architectures, existing works are constrained by narrow frontal field-of-view and limited driving diversity. Consequently, they fail to capture the full spatial context of driving environments, especially during lane changes, turns, and interactions involving peripheral objects such as pedestrians or cyclists. In this paper, we introduce DriverGaze360, a large-scale 360$^\circ$ field of view driver attention dataset, containing $\sim$1 million gaze-labeled frames collected from 19 human drivers, enabling comprehensive omnidirectional modeling of driver gaze behavior. Moreover, our panoramic attention prediction approach, DriverGaze360-Net, jointly learns attention maps and attended objects by employing an auxiliary semantic segmentation head. This improves spatial awareness and attention prediction across wide panoramic inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriverGaze360-Net achieves state-of-the-art attention prediction performance on multiple metrics on panoramic driving images.

TL;DR: Zoom-Zero improves GVQA by localizing query-relevant segments and zooming into salient frames, enhancing temporal grounding and answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs lack temporal awareness, leading to mislocalization and hallucinations in GVQA. Zoom-Zero addresses this by refining temporal grounding and visual verification.

Method: Introduces a coarse-to-fine framework with zoom-in accuracy rewards and token-selective credit assignment to improve GRPO's limitations.

Result: Improves temporal grounding by 5.2% on NExT-GQA and 4.6% on ReXTime, with a 2.4% boost in answer accuracy. Long-video understanding improves by 6.4%.

Conclusion: Zoom-Zero effectively addresses GVQA challenges, offering better temporal grounding and accuracy through a novel coarse-to-fine approach.

Abstract: Grounded video question answering (GVQA) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in videos and generate accurate answers to a given question; however, large video-language models (LVLMs) exhibit limited temporal awareness. Although existing approaches based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) attempt to improve temporal grounding, they still struggle to faithfully ground their answers in the relevant video evidence, leading to temporal mislocalization and hallucinations. In this work, we present Zoom-Zero, a coarse-to-fine framework that first localizes query-relevant segments and then temporally zooms into the most salient frames for finer-grained visual verification. Our method addresses the limits of GRPO for the GVQA task with two key innovations: (i) a zoom-in accuracy reward that validates the fidelity of temporal grounding prediction and facilitates fine-grained visual verification on grounded frames; (ii) token-selective credit assignment, which attributes rewards to the tokens responsible for temporal localization or answer generation, mitigating GRPO's issue in handling multi-faceted reward signals. Our proposed method advances grounded video question answering, improving temporal grounding by 5.2\% on NExT-GQA and 4.6\% on ReXTime, while also enhancing average answer accuracy by 2.4\%. Additionally, the coarse-to-fine zoom-in during inference further benefits long-form video understanding by preserving critical visual details without compromising global context, yielding an average improvement of 6.4\% on long-video benchmarks.

Motivation: The challenge of identifying genuine signals in persistence diagrams hinders practical use of topological data analysis, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Proposes TUN, combining enhanced PD descriptors, self-attention, a PointNet-style encoder, learned fusion, per-point classification, and imbalance-aware training.

Result: TUN outperforms classic methods in detecting significant points in persistence diagrams, demonstrating effectiveness in real-world applications.

Conclusion: TUN provides an automated and reliable solution for identifying critical points in persistence diagrams, enhancing downstream applications.

Abstract: Persistence diagrams (PDs) provide a powerful tool for understanding the topology of the underlying shape of a point cloud. However, identifying which points in PDs encode genuine signals remains challenging. This challenge directly hinders the practical adoption of topological data analysis in many applications, where automated and reliable interpretation of persistence diagrams is essential for downstream decision-making. In this paper, we study automatic significance detection for one-dimensional persistence diagrams. Specifically, we propose Topology Understanding Net (TUN), a multi-modal network that combines enhanced PD descriptors with self-attention, a PointNet-style point cloud encoder, learned fusion, and per-point classification, alongside stable preprocessing and imbalance-aware training. It provides an automated and effective solution for identifying significant points in PDs, which are critical for downstream applications. Experiments show that TUN outperforms classic methods in detecting significant points in PDs, illustrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior 4D generative models reliant on 3D or video optimization, SS4D trains directly on 4D data for better temporal and structural consistency.

Method: The method uses compressed spacetime latents, leverages a pre-trained single-image-to-3D model for spatial consistency, introduces temporal layers for frame coherence, and employs factorized 4D convolutions for efficiency.

Result: The model achieves high fidelity, temporal coherence, and structural consistency in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from monocular video.

Conclusion: SS4D demonstrates the effectiveness of direct 4D training and structured latent compression for generating dynamic 3D content robustly.

Abstract: We present SS4D, a native 4D generative model that synthesizes dynamic 3D objects directly from monocular video. Unlike prior approaches that construct 4D representations by optimizing over 3D or video generative models, we train a generator directly on 4D data, achieving high fidelity, temporal coherence, and structural consistency. At the core of our method is a compressed set of structured spacetime latents. Specifically, (1) To address the scarcity of 4D training data, we build on a pre-trained single-image-to-3D model, preserving strong spatial consistency. (2) Temporal consistency is enforced by introducing dedicated temporal layers that reason across frames. (3) To support efficient training and inference over long video sequences, we compress the latent sequence along the temporal axis using factorized 4D convolutions and temporal downsampling blocks. In addition, we employ a carefully designed training strategy to enhance robustness against occlusion

### [65] [Semantic Mismatch and Perceptual Degradation: A New Perspective on Image Editing Immunity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14320)
*Shuai Dong,Jie Zhang,Guoying Zhao,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method (SIFM) and metric (ISR) to immunize images against unauthorized edits by diffusion models, focusing on disrupting semantic alignment or causing perceptual degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for image immunization overlook the need to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, prompting a new approach to evaluate and achieve true immunization.

Method: Proposes Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), which perturbs diffusion features to disrupt semantic alignment and induce perceptual degradations.

Result: SIFM achieves state-of-the-art performance in protecting images against malicious edits, validated by the novel Immunization Success Rate (ISR) metric.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the core challenge of image immunization by focusing on semantic disruption and perceptual degradation, introducing effective tools for evaluation and protection.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing via diffusion models, while powerful, raises significant concerns about misuse, motivating efforts to immunize images against unauthorized edits using imperceptible perturbations. Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments show our SIFM achieves the state-of-the-art performance for safeguarding visual content against malicious diffusion-based manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DANP, a Dual Attention-Guided Noise Perturbation method, to disrupt text-to-image diffusion models and prevent misuse by adding imperceptible perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the ethical challenges of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly their potential misuse for creating deceptive or harmful content, by developing a more effective defense mechanism.

Method: DANP adds imperceptible perturbations to manipulate cross-attention maps and noise prediction processes, using dynamic thresholds to identify and misguide edits, while maximizing noise discrepancies.

Result: DANP achieves state-of-the-art performance in immunizing against malicious edits, as confirmed by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed DANP method effectively disrupts the generation process of text-to-image models, providing a robust defense against misuse while preserving intended targets.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image diffusion models has transformed image editing via text prompts, yet this also introduces significant ethical challenges from potential misuse in creating deceptive or harmful content. While current defenses seek to mitigate this risk by embedding imperceptible perturbations, their effectiveness is limited against malicious tampering. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attention-Guided Noise Perturbation (DANP) immunization method that adds imperceptible perturbations to disrupt the model's semantic understanding and generation process. DANP functions over multiple timesteps to manipulate both cross-attention maps and the noise prediction process, using a dynamic threshold to generate masks that identify text-relevant and irrelevant regions. It then reduces attention in relevant areas while increasing it in irrelevant ones, thereby misguides the edit towards incorrect regions and preserves the intended targets. Additionally, our method maximizes the discrepancy between the injected noise and the model's predicted noise to further interfere with the generation. By targeting both attention and noise prediction mechanisms, DANP exhibits impressive immunity against malicious edits, and extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Jooyeol Yun,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to recover semantic structure in SVGs for reliable animation, improving coherence by grouping low-level shapes into semantic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating SVG animation is challenging for VLMs due to fragmented low-level shapes lacking semantic guidance. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The framework uses statistical aggregation of weak part predictions to infer semantics and reorganizes SVGs into semantic groups for better animation.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements over existing approaches, demonstrating the importance of semantic recovery for robust SVG animation.

Conclusion: Semantic recovery is key to unlocking reliable SVG animation and enhancing interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are central to modern web design, and the demand to animate them continues to grow as web environments become increasingly dynamic. Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches, suggesting that semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.

*Jie Zhang,Shuai Dong,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TDAE, a bimodal framework combining visual and textual defenses to enhance image immunity against malicious edits, achieving superior cross-model transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for countering malicious image edits lack transferability across different models, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: TDAE includes FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM) for visual defense and Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD) for textual enhancement, both optimized through adversarial updates.

Result: TDAE outperforms existing methods in mitigating malicious edits, demonstrating strong intra- and cross-model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed TDAE framework successfully enhances image immunity against malicious edits with improved transferability, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Recent approaches employing imperceptible perturbations in input images have demonstrated promising potential to counter malicious manipulations in diffusion-based image editing systems. However, existing methods suffer from limited transferability in cross-model evaluations. To address this, we propose Transferable Defense Against Malicious Image Edits (TDAE), a novel bimodal framework that enhances image immunity against malicious edits through coordinated image-text optimization. Specifically, at the visual defense level, we introduce FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM), which incorporates gradient regularization into the adversarial objective. By explicitly steering the perturbations toward flat minima, FDM amplifies immune robustness against unseen editing models. For textual enhancement protection, we propose an adversarial optimization paradigm named Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD), which periodically refines text embeddings to align the editing outcomes of immunized images with those of the original images, then updates the images under optimized embeddings. Through iterative adversarial updates to diverse embeddings, DPD enforces the generation of immunized images that seek a broader set of immunity-enhancing features, thereby achieving cross-model transferability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our TDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating malicious edits under both intra- and cross-model evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS) is proposed to efficiently disentangle static and dynamic regions in dynamic novel view synthesis, reducing model size by 98% and enabling real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of existing dynamic NVS methods, which suffer from large model sizes and slow rendering due to excessive complexity and parameter redundancy.

Method: HGS uses Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives, employing time-dependent RBFs for dynamics and shared parameters for statics, plus a two-stage training strategy.

Result: HGS achieves up to 98% model size reduction, real-time rendering at 125 FPS (4K) on RTX 3090, 160 FPS (1352x1014) on RTX 3050, and comparable rendering quality with improved visual fidelity.

Conclusion: HGS provides an efficient, compact framework for dynamic NVS, enabling real-time applications on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing rendering quality.

Abstract: Dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) is essential for creating immersive experiences. Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces model size by up to 98% and achieves real-time rendering at up to 125 FPS at 4K resolution on a single RTX 3090 GPU. It further sustains 160 FPS at 1352 * 1014 on an RTX 3050 and has been integrated into the VR system. Moreover, HGS achieves comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods while providing significantly improved visual fidelity for high-frequency details and abrupt scene changes.

*Kanglong Fan,Yunqiao Yang,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel self-explaining framework integrates Shapley value estimation during training to improve interpretability without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explanation methods for deep neural networks either lack faithfulness (post-hoc methods) or compromise performance (self-explaining networks).

Method: Proposes integrating Shapley value estimation as an auxiliary task during training to ensure explanations align with model logic and maintain compatibility.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art interpretability on multiple benchmarks with minimal structural modifications.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances interpretability and performance, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their decision-making processes remain opaque. Although many explanation methods are dedicated to bringing the obscurity of DNNs to light, they exhibit significant limitations: post-hoc explanation methods often struggle to faithfully reflect model behaviors, while self-explaining neural networks sacrifice performance and compatibility due to their specialized architectural designs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-explaining framework that integrates Shapley value estimation as an auxiliary task during training, which achieves two key advancements: 1) a fair allocation of the model prediction scores to image patches, ensuring explanations inherently align with the model's decision logic, and 2) enhanced interpretability with minor structural modifications, preserving model performance and compatibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a progressive blurring curriculum for CNNs, mimicking human visual development, to enhance generalization and robustness against distribution shifts and noise while maintaining in-domain accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human infants' gradual refinement of visual acuity, the study aims to improve CNN robustness and generalization by training on progressively less blurred images, countering claims that early blurring harms performance.

Method: The method involves training CNNs on highly blurred images initially and gradually reducing blur intensity over epochs, encouraging focus on global structures over high-frequency details.

Result: Experiments show reductions in mean corruption error (mCE) by 8.30% on CIFAR-10-C and 4.43% on ImageNet-100-C, with improved robustness against noise and adversarial attacks, complementing other augmentation techniques.

Conclusion: The progressive blurring curriculum enhances CNN robustness and generalization without compromising in-domain accuracy, offering consistent gains across datasets and compatibility with other augmentation methods.

Abstract: The human visual system is remarkably adept at adapting to changes in the input distribution; a capability modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) still struggle to match. Drawing inspiration from the developmental trajectory of human vision, we propose a progressive blurring curriculum to improve the generalization and robustness of CNNs. Human infants are born with poor visual acuity, gradually refining their ability to perceive fine details. Mimicking this process, we begin training CNNs on highly blurred images during the initial epochs and progressively reduce the blur as training advances. This approach encourages the network to prioritize global structures over high-frequency artifacts, improving robustness against distribution shifts and noisy inputs. Challenging prior claims that blurring in the initial training epochs imposes a stimulus deficit and irreversibly harms model performance, we reveal that early-stage blurring enhances generalization with minimal impact on in-domain accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed curriculum reduces mean corruption error (mCE) by up to 8.30% on CIFAR-10-C and 4.43% on ImageNet-100-C datasets, compared to standard training without blurring. Unlike static blur-based augmentation, which applies blurred images randomly throughout training, our method follows a structured progression, yielding consistent gains across various datasets. Furthermore, our approach complements other augmentation techniques, such as CutMix and MixUp, and enhances both natural and adversarial robustness against common attack methods.

Motivation: Existing models for 3D scene understanding are task-specific, limiting their versatility. UNITE aims to unify multiple semantic tasks in a single model.

Method: UNITE is a feed-forward neural network trained with 2D distillation, self-supervision, and multi-view losses for 3D consistency. It predicts multiple semantic attributes from RGB images.

Result: UNITE outperforms task-specific models and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various semantic tasks, even without ground truth 3D geometry.

Conclusion: UNITE demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of a unified approach for 3D scene understanding, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Holistic 3D scene understanding involves capturing and parsing unstructured 3D environments. Due to the inherent complexity of the real world, existing models have predominantly been developed and limited to be task-specific. We introduce UNITE, a Unified Semantic Transformer for 3D scene understanding, a novel feed-forward neural network that unifies a diverse set of 3D semantic tasks within a single model. Our model operates on unseen scenes in a fully end-to-end manner and only takes a few seconds to infer the full 3D semantic geometry. Our approach is capable of directly predicting multiple semantic attributes, including 3D scene segmentation, instance embeddings, open-vocabulary features, as well as affordance and articulations, solely from RGB images. The method is trained using a combination of 2D distillation, heavily relying on self-supervision and leverages novel multi-view losses designed to ensure 3D view consistency. We demonstrate that UNITE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several different semantic tasks and even outperforms task-specific models, in many cases, surpassing methods that operate on ground truth 3D geometry.

TL;DR: The paper challenges the idea that vanilla MLPs struggle with high-frequency content due to architecture, instead attributing it to stable rank degradation during training. Regulating rank improves fidelity, making simple MLPs expressive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disprove the belief that vanilla MLPs inherently fail at high-frequency representation and to propose rank regulation as a solution.

Method: Uses optimizers like Muon to maintain high-rank, near-orthogonal updates during training, enhancing MLP performance.

Result: Significant improvements (up to 9 dB PSNR) across domains like natural/medical images and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: Rank regulation during training can overcome MLPs' low-frequency bias, making them highly expressive without architectural changes.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) based on vanilla Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are widely believed to be incapable of representing high-frequency content. This has directed research efforts towards architectural interventions, such as coordinate embeddings or specialized activation functions, to represent high-frequency signals. In this paper, we challenge the notion that the low-frequency bias of vanilla MLPs is an intrinsic, architectural limitation to learn high-frequency content, but instead a symptom of stable rank degradation during training. We empirically demonstrate that regulating the network's rank during training substantially improves the fidelity of the learned signal, rendering even simple MLP architectures expressive. Extensive experiments show that using optimizers like Muon, with high-rank, near-orthogonal updates, consistently enhances INR architectures even beyond simple ReLU MLPs. These substantial improvements hold across a diverse range of domains, including natural and medical images, and novel view synthesis, with up to 9 dB PSNR improvements over the previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: ExpanDyNeRF offers a robust solution for realistic novel view synthesis in dynamic scenes, supported by the SynDM dataset.

Abstract: In dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) systems, state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods often fail under significant viewpoint deviations, producing unstable and unrealistic renderings. To address this, we introduce Expanded Dynamic NeRF (ExpanDyNeRF), a monocular NeRF framework that leverages Gaussian splatting priors and a pseudo-ground-truth generation strategy to enable realistic synthesis under large-angle rotations. ExpanDyNeRF optimizes density and color features to improve scene reconstruction from challenging perspectives. We also present the Synthetic Dynamic Multiview (SynDM) dataset, the first synthetic multiview dataset for dynamic scenes with explicit side-view supervision-created using a custom GTA V-based rendering pipeline. Quantitative and qualitative results on SynDM and real-world datasets demonstrate that ExpanDyNeRF significantly outperforms existing dynamic NeRF methods in rendering fidelity under extreme viewpoint shifts.

Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with robust image caption evaluation, especially under domain-shift scenarios, necessitating a more reliable method.

Method: Introduces DISCODE with Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss and Gaussian prior for robust score estimation, along with the MCEval benchmark for testing.

Result: DISCODE outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across MCEval and other benchmarks.

Conclusion: DISCODE effectively addresses domain-shift challenges in image caption evaluation, aligning better with human judgments.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, robust image caption evaluation using LVLMs remains challenging, particularly under domain-shift scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce the Distribution-Aware Score Decoder (DISCODE), a novel finetuning-free method that generates robust evaluation scores better aligned with human judgments across diverse domains. The core idea behind DISCODE lies in its test-time adaptive evaluation approach, which introduces the Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss, leveraging a Gaussian prior distribution to improve robustness in evaluation score estimation. This loss is efficiently minimized at test time using an analytical solution that we derive. Furthermore, we introduce the Multi-domain Caption Evaluation (MCEval) benchmark, a new image captioning evaluation benchmark covering six distinct domains, designed to assess the robustness of evaluation metrics. In our experiments, we demonstrate that DISCODE achieves state-of-the-art performance as a reference-free evaluation metric across MCEval and four representative existing benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve privacy-preserving data sharing by tackling the lack of reliable memorization detection and poor generalization of existing methods.

Method: Introduces LCMem, a two-stage training model that combines re-identification and copy detection for cross-domain memorization auditing.

Result: LCMem improves performance by up to 16 percentage points on re-identification and 30 on copy detection, outperforming existing privacy filters.

Conclusion: LCMem sets a new standard for cross-domain privacy auditing, demonstrating the need for stronger protection mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative image modeling have achieved visual realism sufficient to deceive human experts, yet their potential for privacy preserving data sharing remains insufficiently understood. A central obstacle is the absence of reliable memorization detection mechanisms, limited quantitative evaluation, and poor generalization of existing privacy auditing methods across domains. To address this, we propose to view memorization detection as a unified problem at the intersection of re-identification and copy detection, whose complementary goals cover both identity consistency and augmentation-robust duplication, and introduce Latent Contrastive Memorization Network (LCMem), a cross-domain model evaluated jointly on both tasks. LCMem achieves this through a two-stage training strategy that first learns identity consistency before incorporating augmentation-robust copy detection. Across six benchmark datasets, LCMem achieves improvements of up to 16 percentage points on re-identification and 30 percentage points on copy detection, enabling substantially more reliable memorization detection at scale. Our results show that existing privacy filters provide limited performance and robustness, highlighting the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We show that LCMem sets a new standard for cross-domain privacy auditing, offering reliable and scalable memorization detection.

Motivation: Current training-free image editing methods struggle with complex non-rigid edits due to attention collapse, where either positional or semantic features dominate, leading to poor results.

Method: SynPS dynamically modulates positional embeddings and semantic cues based on an editing measurement that quantifies required edits at each denoising step.

Result: Experiments on public and new benchmarks show SynPS achieves superior performance and faithfulness in non-rigid image editing.

Conclusion: SynPS effectively addresses attention collapse in image editing by synergistically leveraging positional and semantic information, ensuring balanced and faithful edits.

Abstract: Training-free image editing with large diffusion models has become practical, yet faithfully performing complex non-rigid edits (e.g., pose or shape changes) remains highly challenging. We identify a key underlying cause: attention collapse in existing attention sharing mechanisms, where either positional embeddings or semantic features dominate visual content retrieval, leading to over-editing or under-editing.To address this issue, we introduce SynPS, a method that Synergistically leverages Positional embeddings and Semantic information for faithful non-rigid image editing. We first propose an editing measurement that quantifies the required editing magnitude at each denoising step. Based on this measurement, we design an attention synergy pipeline that dynamically modulates the influence of positional embeddings, enabling SynPS to balance semantic modifications and fidelity preservation.By adaptively integrating positional and semantic cues, SynPS effectively avoids both over- and under-editing. Extensive experiments on public and newly curated benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and faithfulness of our approach.

### [79] [Score-Based Turbo Message Passing for Plug-and-Play Compressive Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14435)
*Chang Cai,Hao Jiang,Xiaojun Yuan,Ying-Jun Angela Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel message-passing framework, STMP, integrates score-based MMSE denoisers for compressive image recovery, offering fast convergence and high performance, even with quantized measurements (Q-STMP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PnP methods using generic denoisers often fail to capture complex image statistics, leading to suboptimal reconstructions. Score-based generative models provide accurate priors but are computationally expensive.

Method: The paper introduces STMP, combining message-passing with score-based MMSE denoisers, and Q-STMP for quantized measurements, using SE equations for performance prediction.

Result: STMP and Q-STMP achieve superior performance-complexity tradeoffs, with fast convergence (typically 10 iterations) and robustness under 1-bit quantization.

Conclusion: The STMP framework effectively leverages score-based priors for efficient and high-quality compressive image recovery, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Message-passing algorithms have been adapted for compressive imaging by incorporating various off-the-shelf image denoisers. However, these denoisers rely largely on generic or hand-crafted priors and often fall short in accurately capturing the complex statistical structure of natural images. As a result, traditional plug-and-play (PnP) methods often lead to suboptimal reconstruction, especially in highly underdetermined regimes. Recently, score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for accurately characterizing sophisticated image distribution. Yet, their direct use for posterior sampling typically incurs prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, by exploiting the close connection between score-based generative modeling and empirical Bayes denoising, we devise a message-passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. The resulting algorithm, named score-based turbo message passing (STMP), combines the fast convergence of message passing with the expressive power of score-based generative priors. For practical systems with quantized measurements, we further propose quantized STMP (Q-STMP), which augments STMP with a component-wise MMSE dequantization module. We demonstrate that the asymptotic performance of STMP and Q-STMP can be accurately predicted by a set of state-evolution (SE) equations. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that STMP strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff compared with competing baselines, and that Q-STMP remains robust even under 1-bit quantization. Remarkably, both STMP and Q-STMP typically converge within 10 iterations.

*Leon Sick,Lukas Hoyer,Dominik Engel,Pedro Hermosilla,Timo Ropinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained on real video data, using temporal coherence and deep motion priors to improve mask quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on synthetic video data, which poorly models realistic motion. The paper aims to address this by using real video data and improving temporal coherence.

Method: Leverages deep motion priors to identify high-quality keymasks, then uses Sparse-To-Dense Distillation with Temporal DropLoss to train a segmentation model.

Result: The model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Training on real video data and ensuring temporal coherence significantly improves unsupervised video instance segmentation.

Abstract: In recent years, the state-of-the-art in unsupervised video instance segmentation has heavily relied on synthetic video data, generated from object-centric image datasets such as ImageNet. However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train a segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose a Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by a Temporal DropLoss. After training the final model on the resulting dense labelset, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art across various benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces A4-Agent, a zero-shot framework for affordance prediction that decouples the task into three stages using specialized foundation models, outperforming supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address poor generalization in end-to-end affordance prediction models, the paper proposes a training-free approach leveraging pre-trained models.

Method: A4-Agent uses Dreamer (visualization), Thinker (decision-making), and Spotter (localization) stages, combining pre-trained models without fine-tuning.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods in benchmarks and shows strong real-world generalization.

Conclusion: Decoupling affordance prediction into specialized stages with pre-trained models enhances generalization and performance.

Abstract: Affordance prediction, which identifies interaction regions on objects based on language instructions, is critical for embodied AI. Prevailing end-to-end models couple high-level reasoning and low-level grounding into a single monolithic pipeline and rely on training over annotated datasets, which leads to poor generalization on novel objects and unseen environments. In this paper, we move beyond this paradigm by proposing A4-Agent, a training-free agentic framework that decouples affordance prediction into a three-stage pipeline. Our framework coordinates specialized foundation models at test time: (1) a $\textbf{Dreamer}$ that employs generative models to visualize $\textit{how}$ an interaction would look; (2) a $\textbf{Thinker}$ that utilizes large vision-language models to decide $\textit{what}$ object part to interact with; and (3) a $\textbf{Spotter}$ that orchestrates vision foundation models to precisely locate $\textit{where}$ the interaction area is. By leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained models without any task-specific fine-tuning, our zero-shot framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates robust generalization to real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new public dataset of annotated tunnel lining images to address the lack of data for automated defect detection using Deep Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tunnel inspections are inefficient and costly, while existing automated methods lack sufficient domain-specific datasets.

Method: The authors created a diverse dataset of tunnel lining images annotated with common defects (cracks, leaching, water infiltration) to support various DL approaches.

Result: The dataset enables development and testing of supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised DL methods for defect detection and model generalization.

Conclusion: This dataset advances automated tunnel inspection by providing essential domain-specific data for safer and more efficient infrastructure maintenance.

Abstract: Tunnels are essential elements of transportation infrastructure, but are increasingly affected by ageing and deterioration mechanisms such as cracking. Regular inspections are required to ensure their safety, yet traditional manual procedures are time-consuming, subjective, and costly. Recent advances in mobile mapping systems and Deep Learning (DL) enable automated visual inspections. However, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of tunnel datasets. This paper introduces a new publicly available dataset containing annotated images of three different tunnel linings, capturing typical defects: cracks, leaching, and water infiltration. The dataset is designed to support supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised DL methods for defect detection and segmentation. Its diversity in texture and construction techniques also enables investigation of model generalization and transferability across tunnel types. By addressing the critical lack of domain-specific data, this dataset contributes to advancing automated tunnel inspection and promoting safer, more efficient infrastructure maintenance strategies.

*Weiheng Zhao,Zilong Huang,Jiashi Feng,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperCLIP enhances CLIP by adding token-level supervision to improve fine-grained visual-text alignment without extra data or significant computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-like models underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, especially with detailed captions, due to their global similarity focus.

Method: SuperCLIP adds a lightweight linear layer to CLIP's vision encoder for classification-based supervision, leveraging token-level cues.

Result: SuperCLIP improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and visual tasks, even with limited batch sizes or rich captions.

Conclusion: SuperCLIP effectively recovers textual supervision and enhances CLIP's performance without major computational overhead.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) achieves strong generalization in vision-language tasks by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space. However, recent findings show that CLIP-like models still underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, and this issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with long and detailed captions. This stems from CLIP's training objective, which optimizes only global image-text similarity and overlooks token-level supervision - limiting its ability to achieve fine-grained visual-text alignment. To address this, we propose SuperCLIP, a simple yet effective framework that augments contrastive learning with classification-based supervision. By adding only a lightweight linear layer to the vision encoder, SuperCLIP leverages token-level cues to enhance visual-textual alignment - with just a 0.077% increase in total FLOPs, and no need for additional annotated data. Experiments show that SuperCLIP consistently improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and purely visual tasks. These gains hold regardless of whether the model is trained on original web data or rich re-captioned data, demonstrating SuperCLIP's ability to recover textual supervision in both cases. Furthermore, SuperCLIP alleviates CLIP's small-batch performance drop through classification-based supervision that avoids reliance on large batch sizes. Code and models will be made open source.

TL;DR: ReVision, a retinal foundation model, learns from real-world telemedicine data without task-specific training, achieving high zero-shot disease detection accuracy and deployment efficiency in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retinal foundation models rely on curated datasets and extensive optimization, limiting their efficiency in low-resource clinical settings. This work aims to overcome these barriers by leveraging real-world telemedicine data.

Method: ReVision is trained on 485,980 color fundus photographs and diagnostic reports from a decade-long telemedicine program across 162 Chinese institutions. It is evaluated on 27 ophthalmic benchmarks.

Result: ReVision achieves an average AUROC of 0.946 (12 benchmarks) and 0.952 (3 clinical cohorts) in zero-shot disease detection. It matches fine-tuned models with fewer resources and improves diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% in a reader study.

Conclusion: Clinical native intelligence from real-world archives can build efficient medical AI systems for low-resource settings without additional annotation.

Abstract: Current retinal foundation models remain constrained by curated research datasets that lack authentic clinical context, and require extensive task-specific optimization for each application, limiting their deployment efficiency in low-resource settings. Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels. These results demonstrate that clinical native intelligence can be directly extracted from clinical archives without any further annotation to build medical AI systems suited to various low-resource settings.

*Yiheng Huang,Junhong Chen,Anqi Ning,Zhanhong Liang,Nick Michiels,Luc Claesen,Wenyin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DASP, a self-supervised framework, improves nighttime depth estimation by leveraging spatiotemporal priors and a 3D consistency projection loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised monocular depth estimation struggles at night due to low visibility and dynamic objects, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: DASP combines an adversarial branch (with SPLB blocks for spatiotemporal priors) and a self-supervised branch (using 3D consistency projection loss) to enhance nighttime depth estimation.

Result: DASP achieves state-of-the-art performance on Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses nighttime depth estimation challenges, demonstrating superior performance and component efficacy.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has achieved notable success under daytime conditions. However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime depth estimation. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.

TL;DR: CAPRMIL introduces a novel, efficient MIL framework for computational pathology, reducing complexity and resource usage while matching SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the complexity and resource demands of current MIL methods in computational pathology by simplifying aggregation and leveraging global context.

Method: CAPRMIL uses global context-aware tokens and multi-head self-attention with linear complexity, paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator.

Result: Matches SOTA performance, reduces trainable parameters by 48%-92.8%, and lowers FLOPs by 52%-99%, while being GPU-efficient.

Conclusion: CAPRMIL proves that learning context-aware representations before aggregation is scalable and effective for whole-slide analysis.

Abstract: In computational pathology, weak supervision has become the standard for deep learning due to the gigapixel scale of WSIs and the scarcity of pixel-level annotations, with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) established as the principal framework for slide-level model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time. Our results indicate that learning rich, context-aware instance representations before aggregation is an effective and scalable alternative to complex pooling for whole-slide analysis.

Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods falter in generating high-fidelity portraits and precise attribute customization when using multiple reference images.

Method: The paper introduces HiFi-Portrait, featuring a face refiner, landmark generator, and HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features with landmarks. An automated pipeline builds an ID-based dataset for training.

Result: Experiments show HiFi-Portrait exceeds state-of-the-art methods in face similarity and controllability, and works well with SDXL-based techniques.

Conclusion: HiFi-Portrait advances zero-shot portrait generation by enhancing fidelity and control through innovative feature and landmark integration.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based technologies have made significant strides, particularly in identity-preserved portrait generation (IPG). However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control. In addition, we devise an automated pipeline to construct an ID-based dataset for training HiFi-Portrait. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA approaches in face similarity and controllability. Furthermore, our method is also compatible with previous SDXL-based works.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like task interference and imbalance in All-in-One models for medical image restoration (MedIR), which arise due to diverse modalities and degradation types.

Method: Introduces TAT with two innovations: task-adaptive weight generation to avoid gradient conflicts and task-adaptive loss balancing to adjust weights dynamically based on task difficulty.

Result: TAT outperforms existing methods in PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution, both individually and collectively.

Conclusion: TAT effectively manages inter-task relationships in MedIR, demonstrating superior performance and adaptability across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to recover high-quality medical images from their low-quality counterparts. Recent advancements in MedIR have focused on All-in-One models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple different MedIR tasks. However, due to significant differences in both modality and degradation types, using a shared model for these diverse tasks requires careful consideration of two critical inter-task relationships: task interference, which occurs when conflicting gradient update directions arise across tasks on the same parameter, and task imbalance, which refers to uneven optimization caused by varying learning difficulties inherent to each task. To address these challenges, we propose a task-adaptive Transformer (TAT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts to different tasks through two key innovations. First, a task-adaptive weight generation strategy is introduced to mitigate task interference by generating task-specific weight parameters for each task, thereby eliminating potential gradient conflicts on shared weight parameters. Second, a task-adaptive loss balancing strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties, preventing task domination or undertraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks--PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution--both in task-specific and All-in-One settings.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLNet, a novel framework for image retrieval-based cross-view geo-localization, addressing the challenge of matching images from significantly different viewpoints by explicitly modeling spatial correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for IRCVGL often fail to model explicit spatial correspondences, which are crucial for accurate localization. The authors aim to bridge the semantic and geometric gaps between different views explicitly.

Method: CLNet introduces three learnable modules: Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) for spatial alignment, Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) for feature remapping, and Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) for channel reweighting.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (CVUSA, CVACT, VIGOR, and University-1652) show CLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved interpretability and generalizability.

Conclusion: CLNet effectively bridges the semantic and geometric gaps in cross-view geo-localization, outperforming existing methods while providing better interpretability.

Abstract: Image retrieval-based cross-view geo-localization (IRCVGL) aims to match images captured from significantly different viewpoints, such as satellite and street-level images. Existing methods predominantly rely on learning robust global representations or implicit feature alignment, which often fail to model explicit spatial correspondences crucial for accurate localization. In this work, we propose a novel correspondence-aware feature refinement framework, termed CLNet, that explicitly bridges the semantic and geometric gaps between different views. CLNet decomposes the view alignment process into three learnable and complementary modules: a Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) that spatially aligns cross-view features via latent correspondence fields; a Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) that remaps features across perspectives using an MLP-based transformation; and a Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) module that reweights informative feature channels guided by learned spatial cues. The proposed CLNet can jointly capture both high-level semantics and fine-grained alignments. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks, CVUSA, CVACT, VIGOR, and University-1652, demonstrate that our proposed CLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering better interpretability and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets rely on web-crawled images, which mismatch real-world meal photos. FoodLogAthl-218 addresses this gap by using user-submitted images.

Method: Dataset construction from app-collected meal records, with rich metadata and diverse tasks—standard classification, incremental fine-tuning, and context-aware classification.

Result: FoodLogAthl-218 offers 6,925 images across 218 categories, with natural frequency distribution and intra-class diversity. Tasks evaluated using large multimodal models.

Conclusion: The dataset enhances food image classification by reflecting real-world meal contexts and introduces novel tasks for practical dietary applications.

Abstract: Food image classification models are crucial for dietary management applications because they reduce the burden of manual meal logging. However, most publicly available datasets for training such models rely on web-crawled images, which often differ from users' real-world meal photos. In this work, we present FoodLogAthl-218, a food image dataset constructed from real-world meal records collected through the dietary management application FoodLog Athl. The dataset contains 6,925 images across 218 food categories, with a total of 14,349 bounding boxes. Rich metadata, including meal date and time, anonymized user IDs, and meal-level context, accompany each image. Unlike conventional datasets-where a predefined class set guides web-based image collection-our data begins with user-submitted photos, and labels are applied afterward. This yields greater intra-class diversity, a natural frequency distribution of meal types, and casual, unfiltered images intended for personal use rather than public sharing. In addition to (1) a standard classification benchmark, we introduce two FoodLog-specific tasks: (2) an incremental fine-tuning protocol that follows the temporal stream of users' logs, and (3) a context-aware classification task where each image contains multiple dishes, and the model must classify each dish by leveraging the overall meal context. We evaluate these tasks using large multimodal models (LMMs). The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/FoodLog/FoodLogAthl-218.

TL;DR: KEMM is a multimodal survival prediction model that integrates expert reports and prognostic knowledge enhanced by LLMs to improve cancer survival predictions, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with high-dimensional, redundant data and lack sufficient supervision for survival prediction. KEMM addresses these by leveraging expert reports and LLM-generated prognostic knowledge.

Method: KEMM uses expert reports refined by LLMs and prognostic background knowledge (PBK) to enhance predictions. It introduces a knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module to focus on survival-relevant features.

Result: KEMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across five datasets.

Conclusion: KEMM effectively integrates expert knowledge and LLM enhancements to improve cancer survival prediction, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Current multimodal survival prediction methods typically rely on pathology images (WSIs) and genomic data, both of which are high-dimensional and redundant, making it difficult to extract discriminative features from them and align different modalities. Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pilot dataset for event-based ITS to address limitations of frame-based cameras, achieving strong tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frame-based cameras in ITS struggle with dim lighting and high-speed motion. Event cameras offer advantages like low latency and high dynamic range, but research is limited.

Method: Created a pilot dataset for event-based ITS. Developed a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor.

Result: Achieved excellent performance in vehicle and pedestrian tracking.

Conclusion: The dataset and method pave the way for further research in event-based vision for ITS.

Abstract: In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), multi-object tracking is primarily based on frame-based cameras. However, these cameras tend to perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras, characterized by low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, have considerable potential to mitigate these issues. Compared to frame-based vision, there are far fewer studies on event-based vision. To address this research gap, we introduce an initial pilot dataset tailored for event-based ITS, covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. We establish a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset, achieving excellent performance.

*Zhaolun Li,Jichang Li,Yinqi Cai,Junye Chen,Xiaonan Luo,Guanbin Li,Rushi Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FakeRadar is a deepfake detection framework leveraging pretrained models and outlier probing to improve generalization across unseen forgery techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods struggle with cross-domain generalization, failing to adapt to new manipulation techniques.

Method: FakeRadar uses Forgery Outlier Probing and Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, employing contrastive learning and cross-entropy losses to handle diverse forgery types.

Result: FakeRadar outperforms existing methods in cross-domain evaluations, demonstrating robustness against emerging manipulation techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses generalization challenges in deepfake detection, offering a scalable solution for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose FakeRadar, a novel deepfake video detection framework designed to address the challenges of cross-domain generalization in real-world scenarios. Existing detection methods typically rely on manipulation-specific cues, performing well on known forgery types but exhibiting severe limitations against emerging manipulation techniques. This poor generalization stems from their inability to adapt effectively to unseen forgery patterns. To overcome this, we leverage large-scale pretrained models (e.g. CLIP) to proactively probe the feature space, explicitly highlighting distributional gaps between real videos, known forgeries, and unseen manipulations. Specifically, FakeRadar introduces Forgery Outlier Probing, which employs dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples near boundaries of estimated subclusters, simulating novel forgery artifacts beyond known manipulation types. Additionally, we design Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, which optimizes the detector to distinguish real, fake, and outlier samples using proposed outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses. Experiments show that FakeRadar outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets for deepfake video detection, particularly in cross-domain evaluations, by handling the variety of emerging manipulation techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between speed and memory in current methods for real-time, interactive world modeling while ensuring long-term geometric consistency.

Method: Introduces three innovations: Dual Action Representation for robust user control, Reconstituted Context Memory for long-term consistency via dynamic rebuilding and temporal reframing, and Context Forcing for memory-aware distillation.

Result: Generates 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, outperforming existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

Conclusion: WorldPlay successfully achieves real-time, interactive world modeling with long-term consistency, demonstrating its effectiveness through innovations and superior performance.

Abstract: This paper presents WorldPlay, a streaming video diffusion model that enables real-time, interactive world modeling with long-term geometric consistency, resolving the trade-off between speed and memory that limits current methods. WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift. Taken together, WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, comparing favorably with existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

*Zhenghao Zhao,Haoxuan Wang,Kai Wang,Yuzhang Shang,Yuan Hong,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFVD simplifies video dataset distillation by focusing on distilling videos into single informative frames per class, improving optimization efficiency and outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending dataset distillation to video data is challenging due to increased learnable parameters from the temporal dimension, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: SFVD distills videos into single frames per class, uses differentiable interpolation to create sequences, and combines distilled frames with real videos via channel reshaping.

Result: SFVD achieves up to 5.3% improvement on benchmarks like MiniUCF.

Conclusion: SFVD offers a more effective solution for video dataset distillation by focusing on single frames and incorporating temporal information efficiently.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets that allow models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to training on the full dataset. While this approach has shown promising results for image data, extending dataset distillation methods to video data has proven challenging and often leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we first identify the core challenge in video set distillation as the substantial increase in learnable parameters introduced by the temporal dimension of video, which complicates optimization and hinders convergence. To address this issue, we observe that a single frame is often sufficient to capture the discriminative semantics of a video. Leveraging this insight, we propose Single-Frame Video set Distillation (SFVD), a framework that distills videos into highly informative frames for each class. Using differentiable interpolation, these frames are transformed into video sequences and matched with the original dataset, while updates are restricted to the frames themselves for improved optimization efficiency. To further incorporate temporal information, the distilled frames are combined with sampled real videos from real videos during the matching process through a channel reshaping layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SFVD substantially outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to 5.3% on MiniUCF, thereby offering a more effective solution.

### [97] [AMD-HookNet++: Evolution of AMD-HookNet with Hybrid CNN-Transformer Feature Enhancement for Glacier Calving Front Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14639)
*Fei Wu,Marcel Dreier,Nora Gourmelon,Sebastian Wind,Jianlin Zhang,Thorsten Seehaus,Matthias Braun,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMD-HookNet++ is a hybrid CNN-Transformer model for glacier segmentation, improving long-range dependency capture and smoothing calving front delineations compared to pure CNN or Transformer methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate glacier calving front monitoring is essential for ice sheet mass balance and sea level studies, but existing CNN models lack long-range dependency capture.

Method: The hybrid model combines a Transformer branch for global context and a CNN branch for local details, enhanced by a spatial-channel attention module and pixel-to-pixel contrastive supervision.

Result: AMD-HookNet++ achieves state-of-the-art results (IoU: 78.2, HD95: 1,318 m, MDE: 367 m) and smoother calving front delineations on the CaFFe dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-Transformer approach effectively balances global and local features, outperforming pure CNN or Transformer models in glacier segmentation.

Abstract: The dynamics of glaciers and ice shelf fronts significantly impact the mass balance of ice sheets and coastal sea levels. To effectively monitor glacier conditions, it is crucial to consistently estimate positional shifts of glacier calving fronts. AMD-HookNet firstly introduces a pure two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) for glacier segmentation. Yet, the local nature and translational invariance of convolution operations, while beneficial for capturing low-level details, restricts the model ability to maintain long-range dependencies. In this study, we propose AMD-HookNet++, a novel advanced hybrid CNN-Transformer feature enhancement method for segmenting glaciers and delineating calving fronts in synthetic aperture radar images. Our hybrid structure consists of two branches: a Transformer-based context branch to capture long-range dependencies, which provides global contextual information in a larger view, and a CNN-based target branch to preserve local details. To strengthen the representation of the connected hybrid features, we devise an enhanced spatial-channel attention module to foster interactions between the hybrid CNN-Transformer branches through dynamically adjusting the token relationships from both spatial and channel perspectives. Additionally, we develop a pixel-to-pixel contrastive deep supervision to optimize our hybrid model by integrating pixelwise metric learning into glacier segmentation. Through extensive experiments and comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on the challenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe, we show that AMD-HookNet++ sets a new state of the art with an IoU of 78.2 and a HD95 of 1,318 m, while maintaining a competitive MDE of 367 m. More importantly, our hybrid model produces smoother delineations of calving fronts, resolving the issue of jagged edges typically seen in pure Transformer-based approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset and evaluates deep learning models for lymphoma subtyping, achieving 80% accuracy on in-distribution data but facing generalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve lymphoma diagnosis by leveraging deep learning on HE-stained slides, reducing reliance on costly and time-consuming traditional methods.

Method: Evaluated five pathology foundation models with AB-MIL and TransMIL aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x) using multicenter data.

Result: Models achieved >80% accuracy on in-distribution data but dropped to ~60% on out-of-distribution, highlighting generalization issues. 40x resolution was sufficient.

Conclusion: Future work needs larger multicenter studies and automated benchmarking pipelines to address generalization and cover rare subtypes.

Abstract: Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.

TL;DR: The paper presents a flexible pipeline for brain tumor segmentation on MRI, using ensemble models and tumor-specific processing to achieve robust results across diverse tumor types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generalizable brain tumor segmentation due to tumor variability, the study leverages diverse datasets and advanced techniques.

Method: A modular pipeline selects and combines state-of-the-art models, applies tumor-specific preprocessing and post-processing, and uses radiomic features for balanced training and lesion-aware metrics.

Result: The pipeline achieved performance comparable to top-ranked methods on BraTS testing sets, demonstrating robustness across different tumor types.

Conclusion: Custom lesion-aware processing and flexible model selection yield adaptable, clinically viable segmentation without being tied to a single architecture.

Abstract: Robust and generalizable segmentation of brain tumors on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains difficult because tumor types differ widely. The BraTS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge benchmarks segmentation methods on diverse high-quality datasets of adult and pediatric tumors: multi-consortium international pediatric brain tumor segmentation (PED), preoperative meningioma tumor segmentation (MEN), meningioma radiotherapy segmentation (MEN-RT), and segmentation of pre- and post-treatment brain metastases (MET). We present a flexible, modular, and adaptable pipeline that improves segmentation performance by selecting and combining state-of-the-art models and applying tumor- and lesion-specific processing before and after training. Radiomic features extracted from MRI help detect tumor subtype, ensuring a more balanced training. Custom lesion-level performance metrics determine the influence of each model in the ensemble and optimize post-processing that further refines the predictions, enabling the workflow to tailor every step to each case. On the BraTS testing sets, our pipeline achieved performance comparable to top-ranked algorithms across multiple challenges. These findings confirm that custom lesion-aware processing and model selection yield robust segmentations yet without locking the method to a specific network architecture. Our method has the potential for quantitative tumor measurement in clinical practice, supporting diagnosis and prognosis.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the ViRC framework with a Reason Chunking mechanism for multimodal mathematical tasks, improving reasoning by simulating human problem-solving patterns. The ViRC-7B model shows an 18.8% average improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning, unlike humans who repeatedly examine images and use step-by-step reasoning. The goal is to enhance multimodal mathematical reasoning by mimicking human cognitive strategies.

Method: Introduces ViRC with Reason Chunking, structuring reasoning into Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) for coherence and visual integration. Uses the CRUX dataset with annotated CRUs and a progressive training strategy (Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, Strategic RL).

Result: ViRC-7B achieves an 18.8% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The ViRC framework effectively enhances multimodal mathematical reasoning by simulating human cognitive patterns, validated by significant performance improvements.

Abstract: CoT has significantly enhanced the reasoning ability of LLMs while it faces challenges when extended to multimodal domains, particularly in mathematical tasks. Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically create reusable multilingual NER datasets using LLMs, addressing gaps in synthetic supervision resources.

Method: Trains regression models to identify NER-relevant passages, annotates them with multilingual LLMs, and evaluates quality via LLM-as-a-judge.

Result: Regression model achieves >84 F1; trained models outperform baselines with 19x less data. High faithfulness (3.99/5) and completeness (4.05/5) scores.

Conclusion: FiNERweb is a scalable, high-quality resource for multilingual NER, enhancing student-teacher training and addressing label language performance gaps.

Abstract: Recent multilingual named entity recognition (NER) work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can provide effective synthetic supervision, yet such datasets have mostly appeared as by-products of broader experiments rather than as systematic, reusable resources. We introduce FiNERweb, a dataset-creation pipeline that scales the teacher-student paradigm to 91 languages and 25 scripts. Building on FineWeb-Edu, our approach trains regression models to identify NER-relevant passages and annotates them with multilingual LLMs, resulting in about 225k passages with 235k distinct entity labels. Our experiments show that the regression model achieves more than 84 F1, and that models trained on FiNERweb obtain comparable or improved performance in zero shot transfer settings on English, Thai, and Swahili, despite being trained on 19x less data than strong baselines. In addition, we assess annotation quality using LLM-as-a-judge and observe consistently high scores for both faithfulness (3.99 out of 5) and completeness (4.05 out of 5), indicating reliable and informative annotations. Further, we release the dataset with both English labels and translated label sets in the respective target languages because we observe that the performance of current state-of-the-art models drops by 0.02 to 0.09 F1 when evaluated using target language labels instead of English ones. We release FiNERweb together with all accompanying artifacts to the research community in order to facilitate more effective student-teacher training for multilingual named entity recognition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structure-aware decoding method for nested and overlapping entity extraction, combining semantic and structural modeling to improve accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle to maintain semantic integrity and structural consistency in complex entity extraction tasks.

Method: Uses pretrained language models for semantic representations, candidate span generation, structured attention, and hierarchical constraints during decoding.

Result: Shows significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score on ACE 2005, especially for nested and overlapping entities.

Conclusion: Proves structure-aware decoding's effectiveness for complex semantic extraction and lays groundwork for hierarchical understanding in language models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a structure-aware decoding method based on large language models to address the difficulty of traditional approaches in maintaining both semantic integrity and structural consistency in nested and overlapping entity extraction tasks. The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.

### [104] [What Affects the Effective Depth of Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14064)
*Yi Hu,Cai Zhou,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies 'effective depth' in large language models (LLMs), finding that deeper models don't fully utilize their layers. Analysis of the Qwen-2.5 family shows stable effective depth ratios across scales, with no improvement in reasoning from deeper computation. Tasks of varying difficulty also don't increase layer usage, suggesting underutilized depth and opportunities for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deeper LLMs show diminishing performance gains by examining how 'effective depth' varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty.

Method: Analyzes the Qwen-2.5 model family (1.5B-32B) to measure effective depth, comparing base and long-CoT models, and evaluating tasks of varying difficulty.

Result: Effective depth ratio remains stable across model sizes; reasoning improvements come from longer context, not deeper computation. Models don't use more layers for harder tasks.

Conclusion: Current LLMs underuse their depth, indicating opportunities for better layer utilization, pruning, and early exiting strategies.

Abstract: The scaling of large language models (LLMs) emphasizes increasing depth, yet performance gains diminish with added layers. Prior work introduces the concept of "effective depth", arguing that deeper models fail to fully utilize their layers for meaningful computation. Building on this, we systematically study how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty. First, we analyze the model behavior of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems. Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AR-to-dLM conversion to enhance diffusion language models (dLMs) by leveraging pretrained autoregressive (AR) models, improving speed and accuracy through optimized attention patterns and masking strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of training dLMs from scratch and bridge the performance gap with AR models, the study explores converting pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs.

Method: Proposes a block-wise attention pattern and a position-dependent token masking strategy to preserve pretrained AR weight distributions and reduce the training-test gap in mask token distributions.

Result: Efficient-DLM models outperform state-of-the-art AR and dLMs, achieving higher accuracy and throughput, e.g., +5.4%/+2.7% accuracy and 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates scalable AR-to-dLM conversion, offering actionable insights and a framework (Efficient-DLM) that excels in both efficiency and task accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.

*Siran Liu,Zane Cao,Yongchao He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniSparse is a unified sparse attention mechanism using composite tokens for efficient long-context understanding, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the quadratic scaling bottleneck of self-attention in LLMs, UniSparse aims to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy or generality.

Method: UniSparse introduces composite tokens for multi-granularity context aggregation and dynamically constructs sparse attention via compression and block-level selection.

Result: UniSparse achieves≥99% of full-attention accuracy and up to 2.61× faster attention computation than FlashAttention, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: UniSparse offers a scalable and efficient solution for long-context tasks, balancing accuracy and speed across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Efficient long-context understanding and reasoning are increasingly vital for large language model (LLM) applications such as multi-turn dialogue and program analysis. However, the core self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length, creating a fundamental computational bottleneck. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate this issue but face trade-offs: training-based methods are costly and cannot be directly applied as acceleration plugins for other models, while inference-time methods often compromise efficiency or cross-modal generality. To address these limitations, we present UniSparse, a unified mechanism that introduces the notion of composite tokens--compact representations that aggregate multi-granularity contextual information. Building on this abstraction, UniSparse dynamically constructs sparse attention through multi-granularity compression and block-level selection, enabling efficient and hardware-friendly execution on GPU. Across multiple modalities and tasks ranging from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications, UniSparse consistently surpasses state-of-the-art sparse attention methods (e.g., MInference, XAttention, FlexPrefill) in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving $\ge$ 99% of full-attention accuracy and up to 2.61$\times$ faster attention computation than FlashAttention.

TL;DR: Multilingual Transformer-based model predicts backchannels in Japanese, English, and Chinese, revealing language-specific timing patterns and cross-lingual differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cross-linguistic timing behavior in backchannel prediction and develop a unified model for multilingual applications.

Method: Transformer-based frame-level model, jointly trained on 300 hours of dyadic conversations with auxiliary tasks.

Result: Multilingual model matches/surpasses monolingual baselines; zero-shot transfer limited. Distinct cue usage across languages revealed.

Conclusion: Findings inform natural, culturally-aware dialogue systems; model demonstrates real-time CPU-only inference.

Abstract: We present a multilingual, continuous backchannel prediction model for Japanese, English, and Chinese, and use it to investigate cross-linguistic timing behavior. The model is Transformer-based and operates at the frame level, jointly trained with auxiliary tasks on approximately 300 hours of dyadic conversations. Across all three languages, the multilingual model matches or surpasses monolingual baselines, indicating that it learns both language-universal cues and language-specific timing patterns. Zero-shot transfer with two-language training remains limited, underscoring substantive cross-lingual differences. Perturbation analyses reveal distinct cue usage: Japanese relies more on short-term linguistic information, whereas English and Chinese are more sensitive to silence duration and prosodic variation; multilingual training encourages shared yet adaptable representations and reduces overreliance on pitch in Chinese. A context-length study further shows that Japanese is relatively robust to shorter contexts, while Chinese benefits markedly from longer contexts. Finally, we integrate the trained model into a real-time processing software, demonstrating CPU-only inference. Together, these findings provide a unified model and empirical evidence for how backchannel timing differs across languages, informing the design of more natural, culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems.

*Yiran Zhang,Jincheng Hu,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CogMem is a memory-augmented LLM architecture designed to improve multi-turn reasoning by using structured memory layers (LTM, DA, FoA) to mitigate common failure modes like bias and memory decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of LLMs in multi-turn interactions, such as reasoning bias, task drift, and unbounded context growth, which degrade accuracy and coherence.

Method: Introduces CogMem, a layered memory architecture with Long-Term Memory (LTM), Direct Access (DA) memory, and Focus of Attention (FoA) to manage context efficiently.

Result: Experiments on TurnBench show CogMem reduces reasoning failures, controls context growth, and enhances consistency in extended reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: CogMem advances LLMs toward more reliable, human-like reasoning by integrating structured memory mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at single-turn reasoning but often lose accuracy and coherence over extended, multi-turn interactions. Recent evaluations such as TurnBench highlight recurring failure modes-reasoning bias, task drift, hallucination, overconfidence, and memory decay. Current approaches typically append full conversational histories, causing unbounded context growth, higher computational costs, and degraded reasoning efficiency. We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn. Experiments on TurnBench show that this layered design mitigates reasoning failures, controls context growth, and improves consistency across extended reasoning chains, moving toward more reliable, human-like reasoning in LLMs.

*Hongqiu Ni,Jiabao Zhang,Guopeng Li,Zilong Wang,Ruiqi Wu,Chi Zhang,Haisheng Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Astraea improves LLM agent workflows by optimizing global job completion time (JCT) via hierarchical scheduling and adaptive KV cache management, reducing JCT by up to 25.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM inference systems focus on per-segment optimization, neglecting end-to-end latency minimization in multi-stage workflows.

Method: Proposes Astraea with state-aware hierarchical scheduling, dynamic request classification, enhanced HRRN policy, and adaptive KV cache management.

Result: Reduces average JCT by up to 25.5% compared to baselines, showing robustness under high load.

Conclusion: Astraea effectively shifts optimization to the global request lifecycle, improving LLM agent efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.

*K. M. Jubair Sami,Dipto Sumit,Ariyan Hossain,Farig Sadeque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes and compares two RAG pipelines for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation, finding the sentence-pair pipeline more effective, reducing WER significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the NLP challenge of translating standard language to regional dialects, particularly in Bengali, due to scarce data and linguistic variation.

Method: Two novel RAG pipelines: Transcript-Based (using dialect sentence contexts) and Standardized Sentence-Pairs (using structured sentence pairs). Evaluated across six dialects with BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore.

Result: Sentence-pair pipeline outperforms transcript-based, reducing WER from 76% to 55% for Chittagong dialect. Shows smaller models can surpass larger ones with effective retrieval strategy.

Conclusion: Provides a fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, emphasizing retrieval strategy over model size for preserving linguistic diversity.

Abstract: Translating from a standard language to its regional dialects is a significant NLP challenge due to scarce data and linguistic variation, a problem prominent in the Bengali language. This paper proposes and compares two novel RAG pipelines for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation. The first, a Transcript-Based Pipeline, uses large dialect sentence contexts from audio transcripts. The second, a more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, utilizes structured local\_dialect:standard\_bengali sentence pairs. We evaluated both pipelines across six Bengali dialects and multiple LLMs using BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore. Our findings show that the sentence-pair pipeline consistently outperforms the transcript-based one, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) from 76\% to 55\% for the Chittagong dialect. Critically, this RAG approach enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to outperform much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), demonstrating that a well-designed retrieval strategy can be more crucial than model size. This work contributes an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity.

*Estelle Zheng,Nathan Cerisara,Sébastien Warichet,Emmanuel Helbert,Christophe Cerisara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QLoRA and LST are compared for fine-tuning LLMs, with LST showing 50% lower memory usage while maintaining performance, enabling efficient training on consumer GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high memory usage issue in fine-tuning large language models, particularly by comparing QLoRA with LST for efficiency.

Method: Introducing Ladder Side Tuning (LST) and its variant xLadder, which adds lightweight side networks and cross-connections for depth extension.

Result: LST reduces peak memory by 50% compared to QLoRA while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling fine-tuning on 12GB GPUs.

Conclusion: LST is a memory-efficient alternative to QLoRA, with xLadder further enhancing depth and reasoning capabilities without extra memory cost.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is often limited by the memory available on commodity GPUs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as QLoRA reduce the number of trainable parameters, yet still incur high memory usage induced by the backward pass in the full model. We revisit Ladder Side Tuning (LST), a rarely explored PEFT technique that adds a lightweight side network, and show that it matches QLoRA's compute scaling slope while cutting peak memory by 50\%. Across different downstream benchmarks spanning natural language understanding, mathematical and LLM-critic tasks, LST has competitive performance with QLoRA's accuracy on average while being much more memory-efficient. This efficiency enables fine-tuning of 7B-parameter models on a single 12 GB consumer GPU with 2k-token contexts, requiring no gradient checkpointing\textemdash conditions under which QLoRA exhausts memory. Beyond memory efficiency, we also establish scaling laws showing that LST scales similarly to QLoRA. We exploit Ladder's architectural flexibility by introducing xLadder, a depth-extended variant that increases effective depth via cross-connections and shortens chain-of-thought (CoT) at fixed parameter count. Ladder is strong when memory is the bottleneck; xLadder builds on this by enabling deeper reasoning without additional memory overhead.

*Juan-José Guzmán-Landa,Juan-Manuel Torres-Moreno,Miguel Figueroa-Saavedra,Ligia Quintana-Torres,Graham Ranger Martha-Lorena Avendaño-Garrido*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces two Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) to expand Nawatl corpora, addressing the lack of digital resources for this Amerindian language. The artificial sentences generated improve learning embeddings and semantic similarity tasks, outperforming the original corpus and some LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nawatl, a National Language of Mexico with limited digital resources, lacks sufficient corpora for training Large Language Models (LLMs). The study aims to expand Nawatl corpora using CFGs to enhance learning embeddings.

Method: Two new Nawatl CFGs are introduced and used in generative mode to produce syntactically valid artificial sentences. These sentences expand the corpus for learning non-contextual embeddings and evaluating semantic similarity.

Result: The expanded corpus improves learning embeddings and semantic similarity tasks compared to the original corpus. Economic embeddings outperform some LLMs.

Conclusion: The introduced CFGs effectively expand Nawatl corpora, enhancing embedding learning and semantic tasks, demonstrating the value of artificial corpus expansion for low-resource languages.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to introduce two Context-Free Grammars (CFG) for Nawatl Corpora expansion. Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $π$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs.

*Yiqing Zhou,Yu Lei,Shuzheng Si,Qingyan Sun,Wei Wang,Yifei Wu,Hao Wen,Gang Chen,Fanchao Qi,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The EDU-based Context Compressor is a novel framework for context compression in LLMs, preserving structure and details via a structure-then-select process, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current compression techniques disrupt coherence or suffer from bias, hindering LLM performance in long-context applications.

Method: The approach uses LingoEDU to transform text into EDU trees and a ranking module to select query-relevant sub-trees.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art structural accuracy, reduces computational costs, and enhances downstream task performance.

Conclusion: The EDU-based Context Compressor offers superior compression, maintaining global structure and fine-grained details.

Abstract: Managing extensive context remains a critical bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in applications like long-document question answering and autonomous agents where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper examines how GPT-3.5-turbo forms inflation perceptions compared to household surveys and official data, finding similarities in short-term projections and some demographic patterns but inconsistencies in modeling inflation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of LLMs like GPT-3.5-turbo in forming inflation perceptions and expectations, comparing them to real-world survey data and official statistics.

Method: Quasi-experimental design using GPT-3.5-turbo's training cut-off to analyze its responses relative to the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey, with a Shapley value decomposition for insights.

Result: GPT-3.5-turbo matches aggregate survey projections and some household patterns but lacks a consistent inflation model. It shows heightened sensitivity to food inflation, akin to humans.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for evaluating LLMs in social sciences, highlighting their potential and limitations for tasks like survey design or model comparison.

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo (GPT), to form inflation perceptions and expectations based on macroeconomic price signals. We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.

TL;DR: Exploring how document-packing strategies affect LLMs' multi-hop reasoning, showing packing boosts performance despite higher compute costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexplored impact of document packing on LLM training dynamics and its effects on model capabilities.

Method: Comparative analysis of document-packing strategies and an ablation study to identify key factors influencing performance.

Result: Packing improves LLM performance compared to individual document training, albeit with increased computational expenses.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of LLM training and offers practical insights for optimizing model development.

Abstract: The standard practice for training large language models involves packing multiple documents together to optimize computational efficiency. However, the impact of this process on the models' capabilities remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how different document-packing strategies influence the latent multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings indicate that packing can improve model performance compared to training on individual documents, at the expense of more compute. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we conduct an ablation study, identifying key factors that explain the advantages of packing. Ultimately, our research deepens the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides practical insights for optimizing model development.

TL;DR: SASQ is a lightweight QAT framework optimizing activation quantization factors without altering pre-trained weights, achieving high accuracy and deployment efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing deployment challenges of large language models (LLMs) due to size outpacing GPU memory advancements, while overcoming trade-offs in existing quantization methods.

Method: SASQ exclusively optimizes quantization factors, adaptively truncates outliers, and maintains activation distribution characteristics.

Result: SASQ outperforms SOTA quantization schemes and FP16 models, reducing perplexity by 5.2% and 4.7% on LLaMA2-7B compared to QuaRot and FP16 respectively.

Conclusion: SASQ provides an efficient, accurate quantization solution for LLMs, balancing performance and deployment practicality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but face deployment challenges due to their growing size outpacing GPU memory advancements. Model quantization mitigates this issue by lowering weight and activation precision, but existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs: dynamic quantization incurs high computational overhead and poses deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.

Result: Shows improved LLM performance in binary code summarization and vulnerability detection across various model sizes.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances LLM capabilities for assembly language tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically excel at coding tasks involving high-level programming languages, as opposed to lower-level programming languages, such as assembly. We propose a synthetic data generation method named C-ing Clearly, which leverages the corresponding C code to enhance an LLM's understanding of assembly. By fine-tuning on data generated through our method, we demonstrate improved LLM performance for binary code summarization and vulnerability detection. Our approach demonstrates consistent gains across different LLM families and model sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the limitations of focusing solely on text-based large language models (LLMs) in bridging deep learning and linguistics, and to advocate for the inclusion of audio-based models to explore more aspects of human language.

Method: The authors critique the existing framework by Futrell and Mahowald, proposing audio-based deep learning models as a complementary approach to address gaps in text-only methods.

Result: The analysis underscores the potential of audio-based models to provide deeper linguistic insights beyond what text-based LLMs can offer.

Conclusion: Audio-based deep learning models should be integrated into frameworks linking deep learning and linguistics to capture a fuller picture of human language.

Abstract: Futrell and Mahowald present a useful framework bridging technology-oriented deep learning systems and explanation-oriented linguistic theories. Unfortunately, the target article's focus on generative text-based LLMs fundamentally limits fruitful interactions with linguistics, as many interesting questions on human language fall outside what is captured by written text. We argue that audio-based deep learning models can and should play a crucial role.

TL;DR: VersatileFFN is a novel feed-forward network that reuses parameters flexibly in width and depth dimensions within a fixed budget, enhancing model capacity without increasing memory costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prohibitive memory costs of large language models while overcoming the representational ceiling of existing compression methods like pruning and quantization.

Method: Proposes VersatileFFN with two adaptive pathways: width-versatile (sub-experts from a shared FFN) and depth-versatile (recursive FFN application). A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the pathways.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across diverse benchmarks and model scales, enhancing capacity computationally without additional memory costs.

Conclusion: VersatileFFN provides a parameter-efficient solution to scale LLMs by reusing parameters adaptively, improving performance without increasing memory usage.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance, but it also leads to prohibitive memory costs. Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering "easy" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to "hard" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/VersatileFFN.

TL;DR: Combining autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives improves language model performance without architectural changes, achieving the benefits of both methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are training-efficient but prone to overfitting, while masked-diffusion models are resilient but less efficient. The goal is to leverage the strengths of both.

Method: Train 50 language models with varying ratios of autoregressive and masked-diffusion objectives under different levels of data repetition to find the optimal balance.

Result: Dual-objective training outperforms single-objective models in all evaluated settings, with a similar optimal ratio for both downstream performance targets.

Conclusion: Combining autoregressive and masked-diffusion objectives is optimal, offering flexibility and improved performance without architectural changes.

Abstract: This paper combines autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives without any architectural modifications, resulting in flexible language models that outperform single-objective models. Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a scalable and reproducible method for generating synthetic survey data that aligns with specific personas and domains.

Method: Instruction-tunes compact chat models (e.g., TinyLlama 1.1B, Phi-2) using LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization, leveraging a dialogue-based data pipeline to preserve persona cues.

Result: Small models achieve performance comparable to larger 7B-8B models (highest BLEU: 0.090, ROUGE-1: 0.429), demonstrating reliability and coherence.

Conclusion: PolyPersona offers an efficient and transparent approach for synthetic survey data generation, enabling scalable evaluation and bias analysis.

Abstract: This paper introduces PolyPersona, a generative framework for synthesizing persona-conditioned survey responses across multiple domains. The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reproducible approach for survey data generation, supporting scalable evaluation while facilitating bias analysis through transparent and open protocols.

*Adarsha Shrestha,Basanta Pokharel,Binit Shrestha,Smriti Adhikari,Dinesh Gothe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GPT-2-based Nepali language model enhanced with GPT-3-inspired training strategies and a custom BPE tokenizer, achieving strong results in generating coherent Nepali news-style text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nepali's complex grammar and limited NLP resources necessitate advanced models tailored for Nepali-specific text generation.

Method: A GPT-2 model was trained using optimized strategies (learning rate schedules, batch scaling, architectural refinements) and a custom 16k BPE tokenizer on a 10.75GB Nepali corpus. FlashAttention was used for efficiency.

Result: The model achieved a training loss of 3.168177, validation loss of 3.081982, and perplexity of 21.80 after two epochs.

Conclusion: The model effectively generates coherent Nepali news-style text, addressing prior limitations in Nepali NLP.

Abstract: Nepali, a low-resource language spoken by over 32 million people, continues to face challenges in natural language processing (NLP) due to its complex grammar, agglutinative morphology, and limited availability of high-quality corpora. Most efforts to date have centered on basic encoder architectures; they remain insufficient for Nepali-specific text generation. This study presents a GPT-2-based Nepali language model trained using several training strategies inspired by GPT-3, including optimized learning rate schedules, batch scaling, and architectural refinements. A custom 16k Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer was trained exclusively on Nepali text to ensure more consistent segmentation and improved input representation. The model was pretrained on a combined dataset comprising a 10.75GB cleaned NepBERTa corpus and additional web-scraped Nepali news articles. FlashAttention was integrated to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. After two epochs, the model achieved a training loss of 3.168177, a validation loss of 3.081982, and a final perplexity of 21.80, demonstrating its capability to generate coherent Nepali news-style text.

### [125] [JMMMU-Pro: Image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark via Vibe Benchmark Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14620)
*Atsuyuki Miyai,Shota Onohara,Jeonghun Baek,Kiyoharu Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JMMMU-Pro is an advanced Japanese multimodal benchmark combining images and text for comprehensive evaluation, built using Vibe Benchmark Construction with generative models and human verification. Open-source LMMs struggle with it, highlighting its rigor and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more rigorous Japanese multimodal understanding benchmark (JMMMU-Pro) and a scalable construction method (Vibe Benchmark Construction) for evaluating LMMs' integrated visual-textual capabilities.

Method: Combines question images and text into single images via visual perception. Uses Nano Banana Pro for image generation, human verification, and prompt adjustments to ensure quality.

Result: Open-source LMMs perform poorly on JMMMU-Pro, proving its effectiveness as a challenging benchmark.

Conclusion: JMMMU-Pro is a robust tool for evaluating Japanese LMMs, and Vibe Benchmark Construction offers a scalable, cost-effective method for future VQA benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper introduces JMMMU-Pro, an image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark, and Vibe Benchmark Construction, a scalable construction method. Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.

### [126] [TiME: Tiny Monolingual Encoders for Efficient NLP Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14645)
*David Schulmeister,Valentin Hartmann,Lars Klein,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders), small but efficient language models tailored for specific NLP tasks, addressing the inefficiencies and sustainability issues of large general-purpose models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models, while versatile, are often inefficient for specific tasks, causing high energy consumption and slow processing. The work aims to create smaller, task-specific models to improve efficiency and sustainability.

Method: The authors train small models using modern techniques like distillation, including support for low-resource languages. They also explore distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers and models with absolute positional embeddings from those with relative embeddings.

Result: TiME models achieve a better balance between performance and efficiency (throughput, latency, energy use) compared to larger models. They also demonstrate successful distillation across different model types.

Conclusion: Small, efficient models like TiME are viable alternatives to large language models for specific tasks, offering improved efficiency and sustainability without compromising performance.

Abstract: Today, a lot of research on language models is focused on large, general-purpose models. However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.

### [127] [Fast and Accurate Causal Parallel Decoding using Jacobi Forcing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14681)
*Lanxiang Hu,Siqi Kou,Yichao Fu,Samyam Rajbhandari,Tajana Rosing,Yuxiong He,Zhijie Deng,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Jacobi Forcing introduces a progressive distillation paradigm to convert autoregressive (AR) models into efficient parallel decoders, achieving significant speedup in inference latency without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limited speedup in diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) caused by pretrain-to-posttrain mismatches and conflicts with causal priors, aiming to enhance parallel decoding efficiency.

Method: The authors propose Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm that trains models on their own parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly transitioning AR models into parallel decoders while preserving causal inference properties.

Result: The Jacobi Forcing Model achieves a 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal performance loss. Multi-block decoding further enhances this with up to 4.5x higher token acceptance and nearly 4.0x speedup.

Conclusion: Jacobi Forcing effectively bridges the gap between pretraining and parallel decoding, enabling faster inference latency while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JacobiForcing.

### [128] [Spoken DialogSum: An Emotion-Rich Conversational Dataset for Spoken Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14687)
*Yen-Ju Lu,Kunxiao Gao,Mingrui Liang,Helin Wang,Thomas Thebaud,Laureano Moro-Velazquez,Najim Dehak,Jesus Villalba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Spoken DialogSum is a new dataset linking conversational audio with factual and emotion-focused summaries, plus paralinguistic cues, improving emotion-aware summarization models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio language models lack data integrating speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues, limiting emotion-aware summarization research.

Method: The dataset is created in two stages: LLM rewrites dialogues with fillers and labels emotions, followed by TTS synthesis.

Result: Spoken DialogSum includes 13,460 dialogues with summaries and labels. An Audio-LLM improves emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% over ASR-LLM.

Conclusion: End-to-end speech modeling in Spoken DialogSum enhances emotion-aware summarization, demonstrating the dataset's value.

Abstract: Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.

### [129] [MMGR: Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14691)
*Zefan Cai,Haoyi Qiu,Tianyi Ma,Haozhe Zhao,Gengze Zhou,Kung-Hsiang Huang,Parisa Kordjamshidi,Minjia Zhang,Xiao Wen,Jiuxiang Gu,Nanyun Peng,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMGR is a new evaluation framework for video and image foundation models, focusing on reasoning abilities (physical, logical, spatial, temporal) and revealing performance gaps in abstract reasoning, embodied navigation, and physical commonsense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like FVD focus on perceptual quality but ignore reasoning failures (e.g., causality, physics). MMGR addresses this gap by evaluating models' generative reasoning across multiple domains.

Method: MMGR evaluates five reasoning abilities (Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, Temporal) across three domains: Abstract Reasoning, Embodied Navigation, and Physical Commonsense. It uses fine-grained metrics for holistic correctness in video and image generation.

Result: Benchmarked models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Nano-banana, GPT-4o-image, etc.) show strong performance gaps, with poor accuracy (<10%) on Abstract Reasoning (e.g., ARC-AGI) and struggles in long-horizon spatial planning.

Conclusion: Current models rely too much on perceptual data, lack global consistency, and prioritize visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR provides a diagnostic benchmark for improving reasoning-aware generative world models.

Abstract: Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.

*Md. Tanzim Ferdous,Naeem Ahsan Chowdhury,Prithwiraj Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new Bangla abstractive summarization dataset with 54,000 articles from diverse sources was developed to address varied real-world texts, outperforming single-domain approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the limitation of existing Bangla summarization datasets, which focus on news articles with fixed styles, by creating a multi-domain dataset to better handle real-world content diversity.

Method: The dataset includes articles and summaries from blogs and newspapers. Baselines were established using deep learning (LSTM) and transfer learning (BanglaT5-small, MTS-small) models.

Result: The dataset demonstrated adaptability across domains and writing styles, serving as a benchmark for Bangla NLP research and supporting low-resource language processing.

Conclusion: This dataset is a foundational resource for robust Bangla summarization systems and advances NLP capabilities for low-resource languages.

Abstract: This study developed a new Bangla abstractive summarization dataset to generate concise summaries of Bangla articles from diverse sources. Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style. While such approaches are effective in limited contexts, they often fail to adapt to the varied nature of real-world Bangla texts. In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance. To establish strong baselines, we trained and evaluated this dataset using several deep learning and transfer learning models, including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small. The results highlight its potential as a benchmark for future research in Bangla natural language processing. This dataset provides a solid foundation for building robust summarization systems and helps expand NLP resources for low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores learning rate scheduling in large language models, focusing on annealing strategies. It introduces a predictive framework under the WSD scheduler to optimize schedules efficiently, showing that smaller models can guide strategies for larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and optimizing annealing strategies for learning rate scheduling in large language models is complex. The study aims to simplify this by investigating transferable dynamics and refining a predictive framework.

Method: The authors develop a generalized predictive framework for the WSD scheduler, incorporating training steps, maximum learning rate, and annealing behavior. They use smaller models as proxies for larger ones to avoid exhaustive searches.

Result: The framework enables efficient optimization of learning rate schedules, with experiments on Dense and MoE models showing consistent and transferable annealing patterns.

Conclusion: Smaller models can reliably guide annealing strategies for larger models, reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, as demonstrated across various model configurations.

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is crucial for training large language models, yet understanding the optimal annealing strategies across different model configurations remains challenging. In this work, we investigate the transferability of annealing dynamics in large language model training and refine a generalized predictive framework for optimizing annealing strategies under the Warmup-Steady-Decay (WSD) scheduler. Our improved framework incorporates training steps, maximum learning rate, and annealing behavior, enabling more efficient optimization of learning rate schedules. Our work provides a practical guidance for selecting optimal annealing strategies without exhaustive hyperparameter searches, demonstrating that smaller models can serve as reliable proxies for optimizing the training dynamics of larger models. We validate our findings on extensive experiments using both Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, demonstrating that optimal annealing ratios follow consistent patterns and can be transferred across different training configurations.

### [133] [Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Mathematical Reasoning Finetuning through Mixed Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13706)
*John Graham Reynolds*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Finetuning large language models for specialized tasks causes catastrophic forgetting. Mixed training strategies combining task-specific and general examples prevent this while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in large language models when finetuning for specialized tasks, ensuring they retain general capabilities.

Method: Finetune Flan-T5-Base on DeepMind Mathematics dataset, measure forgetting on MultiNLI, and propose mixed training strategies interleaving math and NLI examples.

Result: Math-only training improves math accuracy but collapses NLI accuracy; mixed training maintains math accuracy while preserving NLI performance.

Conclusion: Mixed training prevents catastrophic forgetting, showing specialization doesn't require losing general capabilities, with potential benefits for larger models.

Abstract: When finetuning large language models for specialized tasks such as mathematical reasoning, models exhibit catastrophic forgetting, losing previously learned capabilities. We investigate this by finetuning Flan-T5-Base (250M parameters) on the DeepMind Mathematics dataset and measuring forgetting on MultiNLI. Math-only training improves mathematical accuracy from 3.1\% to 12.0\% but causes NLI accuracy to collapse from 81.0\% to 16.5\%--a 64.5 percentage point drop occurring within the first 1,000 training steps. We propose mixed training strategies that interleave mathematical and NLI examples during training. Our results demonstrate that mixed training completely eliminates catastrophic forgetting while maintaining equivalent mathematical performance: the balanced 1:1 ratio achieves 12.0\% math accuracy (matching math-only) while preserving 86.2\% NLI accuracy. We systematically explore mixing ratios from 1:1 to 15:1, finding that even minimal NLI exposure (6.2\%) provides effective regularization. These findings demonstrate that specialization need not require forgetting general capabilities, with implications for scaling to larger models where mixed training may confer additional benefits beyond forgetting prevention.

*Kaiming Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VPIA is a novel method for inferring interaction structures in complex dynamical systems from steady-state data, overcoming challenges of nonlinearity, heterogeneity, and higher-order couplings without needing temporal data or supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle nonlinear, heterogeneous, and higher-order couplings in complex systems, especially when only steady-state observations are available. VPIA aims to address these limitations.

Method: VPIA uses a variational physics-informed approach, embedding steady-state constraints into a differentiable framework. It minimizes a physics-derived residual without needing temporal trajectories or derivative estimation, leveraging residual sampling and natural-gradient optimization.

Result: VPIA accurately recovers directed, weighted, and multi-body interaction structures under noise, demonstrating robustness across diverse nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: VPIA provides a unified, scalable, and robust framework for inferring complex interaction networks from snapshot observations, advancing the field of physics-constrained inference.

Abstract: The interaction structure of a complex dynamical system governs its collective behavior, yet existing reconstruction methods struggle with nonlinear, heterogeneous, and higher-order couplings, especially when only steady states are observable. We propose a Variational Physics-Informed Ansatz (VPIA) that infers general interaction operators directly from heterogeneous steady-state data. VPIA embeds the steady-state constraints of the dynamics into a differentiable variational representation and reconstructs the underlying couplings by minimizing a physics-derived steady-state residual, without requiring temporal trajectories, derivative estimation, or supervision. Residual sampling combined with natural-gradient optimization enables scalable learning of large and higher-order networks. Across diverse nonlinear systems, VPIA accurately recovers directed, weighted, and multi-body structures under substantial noise, providing a unified and robust framework for physics-constrained inference of complex interaction networks in settings where only snapshot observations are available.

*Edwin Oluoch Awino,Denis Machanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study uses SAR imagery and environmental data to model flood susceptibility in Kenya's River Nyando watershed, with Random Forest (RF) outperforming other ML models. The results highlight high-risk areas and support disaster risk management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flooding causes severe global damage, but data-scarce regions like Kenya lack effective flood mapping tools. This study aims to improve susceptibility modeling by integrating SAR and ML.

Method: Sentinel-1 SAR data from a 2024 flood event were processed into a flood inventory, combined with six conditioning factors, and used to train LR, CART, SVM, and RF models. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, Kappa, and ROC analysis.

Result: RF achieved the best performance (accuracy = 0.762; Kappa = 0.480). The resulting susceptibility map identified the Kano Plains as highly vulnerable, aligning with historical data.

Conclusion: Combining SAR and ensemble ML methods enhances flood susceptibility mapping in data-limited regions, providing insights for risk reduction and planning.

Abstract: Flooding is one of the most destructive natural hazards worldwide, posing serious risks to ecosystems, infrastructure, and human livelihoods. This study combines Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with environmental and hydrological data to model flood susceptibility in the River Nyando watershed, western Kenya. Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR data from the May 2024 flood event were processed to produce a binary flood inventory, which served as training data for machine learning (ML) models. Six conditioning factors -- slope, elevation, aspect, land use/land cover, soil type, and distance from streams -- were integrated with the SAR-derived flood inventory to train four supervised classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results indicate that RF achieved the highest predictive performance (accuracy = 0.762; Kappa = 0.480), outperforming LR, CART, and SVM. The RF-based susceptibility map showed that low-lying Kano Plains near Lake Victoria have the highest flood vulnerability, consistent with historical flood records and the impacts of the May 2024 event. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SAR data and ensemble ML methods for flood susceptibility mapping in regions with limited data. The resulting maps offer important insights for disaster risk reduction, land-use planning, and early warning system development.

*Aadya Goel,Mayuri Sridhar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hessian Reassignment is introduced as an efficient, model-agnostic method for class-level unlearning in document classifiers, achieving accuracy close to full retraining while being faster and improving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied area of class-level unlearning in document classifiers, aiming to remove specific training data influence without full retraining.

Method: Uses a two-step approach: (1) Influence-style update via Hessian-vector system and (2) enforcing a decision-space guarantee with Top-1 classification.

Result: Achieves retained-class accuracy close to full retraining but faster, and reduces membership-inference advantage on removed classes.

Conclusion: Hessian Reassignment offers a practical, principled solution for efficient class unlearning in document classification, balancing accuracy and privacy.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific training data from a model without full retraining. While much progress has been made in unlearning for LLMs, document classification models remain relatively understudied. In this paper, we study class-level unlearning for document classifiers and present Hessian Reassignment, a two-step, model-agnostic solution. First, we perform a single influence-style update that subtracts the contribution of all training points from the target class by solving a Hessian-vector system with conjugate gradients, requiring only gradient and Hessian-vector products. Second, in contrast to common unlearning baselines that randomly reclassify deleted-class samples, we enforce a decision-space guarantee via Top-1 classification. On standard text benchmarks, Hessian Reassignment achieves retained-class accuracy close to full retrain-without-class while running orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, it consistently lowers membership-inference advantage on the removed class, measured with pooled multi-shadow attacks. These results demonstrate a practical, principled path to efficient class unlearning in document classification.

*Eric Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning framework predicts RSV hospitalization risks in the U.S. using wastewater, weather, and air quality data, highlighting disparities among Native Americans and Alaska Natives and higher rates at high altitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RSV is a major cause of child hospitalizations, influenced by environmental factors. This study aims to predict outbreaks for timely interventions.

Method: Integrated wastewater, meteorological, and air quality data were analyzed using CART, Random Forest, and Boosting models to classify weekly hospitalization risks.

Result: Wastewater RSV levels were the top predictor, followed by weather and air quality variables. Higher hospitalization rates were found among Native Americans/Alaska Natives and in high-altitude states.

Conclusion: Combining environmental and community data improves RSV outbreak forecasting. An interactive dashboard was developed for practical use.

Abstract: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of hospitalization among young children, with outbreaks strongly influenced by environmental conditions. This study developed a machine learning framework to predict RSV-associated hospitalizations in the United States (U.S.) by integrating wastewater surveillance, meteorological, and air quality data. The dataset combined weekly hospitalization rates, wastewater RSV levels, daily meteorological measurements, and air pollutant concentrations. Classification models, including CART, Random Forest, and Boosting, were trained to predict weekly RSV-associated hospitalization rates classified as \textit{Low risk}, \textit{Alert}, and \textit{Epidemic} levels. The wastewater RSV level was identified as the strongest predictor, followed by meteorological and air quality variables such as temperature, ozone levels, and specific humidity. Notably, the analysis also revealed significantly higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Further research is needed to better understand the drivers of RSV disparity in these communities to improve prevention strategies. Furthermore, states at high altitudes, characterized by lower surface pressure, showed consistently higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates. These findings highlight the value of combining environmental and community surveillance data to forecast RSV outbreaks, enabling more timely public health interventions and resource allocation. In order to provide accessibility and practical use of the models, we have developed an interactive R Shiny dashboard (https://f6yxlu-eric-guo.shinyapps.io/rsv_app/), which allows users to explore RSV-associated hospitalization risk levels across different states, visualize the impact of key predictors, and interactively generate RSV outbreak forecasts.

Motivation: EEG data are often scarce, patient-specific, and governed by privacy regulations, making centralized AI-based seizure detection models impractical.

Method: A two-stage framework: Stage 1 fine-tunes a pretrained biosignal transformer using federated learning; Stage 2 adapts the classifier per patient with few-shot learning.

Result: Federated fine-tuning achieved balanced accuracy (0.43), Cohen's kappa (0.42), and F1 (0.69). Few-shot personalization improved accuracy to 0.77.

Conclusion: FFSL supports effective patient-adaptive seizure detection under realistic data and privacy constraints.

Abstract: Many deep learning approaches have been developed for EEG-based seizure detection; however, most rely on access to large centralized annotated datasets. In clinical practice, EEG data are often scarce, patient-specific distributed across institutions, and governed by strict privacy regulations that prohibit data pooling. As a result, creating usable AI-based seizure detection models remains challenging in real-world medical settings. To address these constraints, we propose a two-stage federated few-shot learning (FFSL) framework for personalized EEG-based seizure detection. The method is trained and evaluated on the TUH Event Corpus, which includes six EEG event classes. In Stage 1, a pretrained biosignal transformer (BIOT) is fine-tuned across non-IID simulated hospital sites using federated learning, enabling shared representation learning without centralizing EEG recordings. In Stage 2, federated few-shot personalization adapts the classifier to each patient using only five labeled EEG segments, retaining seizure-specific information while still benefiting from cross-site knowledge. Federated fine-tuning achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.43 (centralized: 0.52), Cohen's kappa of 0.42 (0.49), and weighted F1 of 0.69 (0.74). In the FFSL stage, client-specific models reached an average balanced accuracy of 0.77, Cohen's kappa of 0.62, and weighted F1 of 0.73 across four sites with heterogeneous event distributions. These results suggest that FFSL can support effective patient-adaptive seizure detection under realistic data-availability and privacy constraints.

### [139] [Time-Constrained Recommendations: Reinforcement Learning Strategies for E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13726)
*Sayak Chakrabarty,Souradip Pal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using reinforcement learning to optimize recommendations under user time constraints, showing improved performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User time budgets introduce resource constraints in recommendations, requiring a balance between item relevance and evaluation cost to maximize engagement.

Method: The paper formulates time-constrained slate recommendations as MDPs with budget-aware utilities and evaluates reinforcement learning algorithms on Alibaba's dataset.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that on-policy and off-policy reinforcement learning outperforms contextual bandit methods under tight time budgets.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can effectively craft recommendations that align with user time constraints, enhancing engagement potential.

Abstract: Unlike traditional recommendation tasks, finite user time budgets introduce a critical resource constraint, requiring the recommender system to balance item relevance and evaluation cost. For example, in a mobile shopping interface, users interact with recommendations by scrolling, where each scroll triggers a list of items called slate. Users incur an evaluation cost - time spent assessing item features before deciding to click. Highly relevant items having higher evaluation costs may not fit within the user's time budget, affecting engagement. In this position paper, our objective is to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms that learn patterns in user preferences and time budgets simultaneously, crafting recommendations with higher engagement potential under resource constraints. Our experiments explore the use of reinforcement learning to recommend items for users using Alibaba's Personalized Re-ranking dataset supporting slate optimization in e-commerce contexts. Our contributions include (i) a unified formulation of time-constrained slate recommendation modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with budget-aware utilities; (ii) a simulation framework to study policy behavior on re-ranking data; and (iii) empirical evidence that on-policy and off-policy control can improve performance under tight time budgets than traditional contextual bandit-based methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAST-MoE, a reinforcement learning framework for ride-hailing platforms that improves efficiency and reduces delays by automating expert specialization and leveraging spatiotemporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing passenger waiting times and system efficiency in ride-hailing platforms under uncertain supply-demand conditions.

Method: Proposes Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which uses a self-attention MoE encoder and a physics-informed congestion surrogate for efficient rollouts.

Result: Outperforms baselines, improving total reward by 13% and reducing matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively on Uber trajectory data.

Conclusion: RAST-MoE demonstrates the potential of MoE-enhanced RL for complex spatiotemporal decision-making in large-scale systems.

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms face the challenge of balancing passenger waiting times with overall system efficiency under highly uncertain supply-demand conditions. Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns.
  We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies.
  With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines. On real-world Uber trajectory data (San Francisco), it improves total reward by over 13%, reducing average matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively. It demonstrates robustness across unseen demand regimes and stable training. These findings highlight the potential of MoE-enhanced RL for large-scale decision-making with complex spatiotemporal dynamics.

*Bhavesh Kumar,Roger Jin,Jeffrey Quesnelle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CurvaDion reduces communication in distributed training by dynamically synchronizing gradients only in high-curvature regions, using RMMC for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed training of large language models faces a bottleneck in gradient synchronization. Existing methods synchronize at every step, ignoring variations in optimization landscape.

Method: Introduces CurvaDion, which uses Relative Maximum Momentum Change (RMMC) to detect high-curvature regions requiring synchronization, leveraging existing momentum dynamics for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 99% communication reduction while matching baseline convergence for models ranging from 160M to 1.3B parameters.

Conclusion: CurvaDion efficiently reduces redundant synchronization in distributed training, improving scalability without sacrificing convergence.

Abstract: As language models scale to trillions of parameters, distributed training across many GPUs becomes essential, yet gradient synchronization over high-bandwidth, low-latency networks remains a critical bottleneck. While recent methods like Dion reduce per-step communication through low-rank updates, they synchronize at every step regardless of the optimization landscape. We observe that synchronization requirements vary dramatically throughout training: workers naturally compute similar gradients in flat regions, making frequent synchronization redundant, while high-curvature regions require coordination to prevent divergence. We introduce CurvaDion, which uses Relative Maximum Momentum Change (RMMC) to detect high-curvature regions requiring synchronization. RMMC leverages momentum dynamics which are already computed during optimization as a computationally tractable proxy for directional curvature, adding only $\mathcal{O}(d)$ operations per layer. We establish theoretical connections between RMMC and loss curvature and demonstrate that CurvaDion achieves 99\% communication reduction while matching baseline convergence across models from 160M to 1.3B parameters.

*Jacob Schnell,Aditya Makkar,Gunadi Gani,Aniket Srinivasan Ashok,Darren Lo,Mike Optis,Alexander Wong,Yuhao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces WindDM, a diffusion model using composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) for high-resolution wind data reconstruction, offering accurate and cost-effective results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution wind data is crucial for weather modelling but is expensive and challenging to acquire. Current methods often trade off cost for accuracy, and deep learning approaches need adaptation for wind data's unique characteristics.

Method: The authors propose CCFG, a generalization of classifier-free guidance for multiple conditioning inputs, integrated into WindDM, a diffusion model tailored for wind data super-resolution.

Result: WindDM with CCFG outperforms traditional CFG in fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while being up to 1000× cheaper than classical methods.

Conclusion: The CCFG-enhanced WindDM effectively addresses the cost-accuracy trade-off in wind data reconstruction, offering a scalable and superior alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Various weather modelling problems (e.g., weather forecasting, optimizing turbine placements, etc.) require ample access to high-resolution, highly accurate wind data. Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout. We demonstrate that CCFG outputs are higher-fidelity than those from CFG on wind super-resolution tasks. We present WindDM, a diffusion model trained for industrial-scale wind dynamics reconstruction and leveraging CCFG. WindDM achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality among deep learning models and costs up to $1000\times$ less than classical methods.

*Weijie Yang,Xun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIS, a set-conditioned diffusion framework, is proposed for robust physical parameter inversion from sparse, irregular measurements, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of estimating PDE-constrained parameters from sparse, real-world measurements is ill-posed, and current deep learning models fail under such conditions.

Method: PIS uses a Set Transformer-based encoder for arbitrary measurements, a cosine-annealed sparsity curriculum for robustness, and includes information-theoretic analysis for extreme sparsity limits.

Result: PIS significantly reduces inversion error (12.28%--88.73%) and provides calibrated posterior samples, outperforming baselines in tasks like Darcy flow and Helmholtz inversion.

Conclusion: PIS is a sparsity-resilient, general-purpose solution for physical inversion under severely undersampled observations.

Abstract: Estimation of PDE-constrained physical parameters from limited indirect measurements is inherently ill-posed, particularly when observations are sparse, irregular, and constrained by real-world sensor placement. This challenge is ubiquitous in fields such as fluid mechanics, seismic inversion, and structural health monitoring. Existing deep and operator-learning models collapse under these conditions: fixed-grid assumptions fail, reconstruction deteriorates sharply, and inversion becomes unreliable with limited robustness and no uncertainty quantification (UQ).We propose the Physical Inversion Solver (PIS), a set-conditioned diffusion framework enabling inversion from truly arbitrary observation sets. PIS employs a Set Transformer-based encoder to handle measurements of any number or geometry, and a cosine-annealed sparsity curriculum for exceptional robustness. An accompanying information-theoretic analysis provides insight into the limits of inversion under extreme sparsity by revealing how observation entropy varies across physical systems.PIS is evaluated on three challenging PDE inverse problems: Darcy flow, wavefield inversion (Helmholtz), and structural health monitoring (Hooke's Law). Across all tasks and sparsity regimes -- including extreme cases with an observation rate of only $0.29\%$ -- existing operator-learning baselines fail to reconstruct meaningful fields, often diverging or collapsing entirely.In stark contrast, PIS remains stable and accurate, reducing inversion error by $12.28\%$--$88.73\%$ and reliably producing calibrated posterior samples. These samples accurately reflect both data scarcity and intrinsic physical ambiguity. These results position PIS as a powerful, general-purpose, and uniquely sparsity-resilient solution for physical inversion under arbitrary and severely undersampled observations.

### [144] [Low-Rank Compression of Language Models via Differentiable Rank Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13733)
*Sidhant Sundrani,Francesco Tudisco,Pasquale Minervini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLRC is a gradient-based method for low-rank compression of large-language models without fine-tuning, outperforming existing techniques in task accuracy across various compression rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rank selection methods for low-rank compression are either heuristic-based (suboptimal) or gradient-based (less performant without fine-tuning), motivating the need for a better approach.

Method: LLRC learns mask weights to select singular values using a calibration dataset, minimizing activation divergence from the original model without fine-tuning.

Result: LLRC outperforms competitors (e.g., STRS, SVD-LLM, LLM-Pruner) on tasks like MMLU, BoolQ, and OpenbookQA, achieving higher accuracy at 20% compression on Llama-2-13B.

Conclusion: LLRC offers a fine-tuning-free solution for optimal low-rank compression, balancing task performance and compression rates effectively.

Abstract: Approaches for compressing large-language models using low-rank decomposition have made strides, particularly with the introduction of activation and loss-aware SVD, which improves the trade-off between decomposition rank and downstream task performance. Despite these advancements, a persistent challenge remains--selecting the optimal ranks for each layer to jointly optimise compression rate and downstream task accuracy. Current methods either rely on heuristics that can yield sub-optimal results due to their limited discrete search space or are gradient-based but are not as performant as heuristic approaches without post-compression fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose Learning to Low-Rank Compress (LLRC), a gradient-based approach which directly learns the weights of masks that select singular values in a fine-tuning-free setting. Using a calibration dataset, we train only the mask weights to select fewer and fewer singular values while minimising the divergence of intermediate activations from the original model. Our approach outperforms competing ranking selection methods that similarly require no post-compression fine-tuning across various compression rates on common-sense reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks. For instance, with a compression rate of 20% on Llama-2-13B, LLRC outperforms the competitive Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS) on MMLU, BoolQ, and OpenbookQA by 12%, 3.5%, and 4.4%, respectively. Compared to other compression techniques, our approach consistently outperforms fine-tuning-free variants of SVD-LLM and LLM-Pruner across datasets and compression rates. Our fine-tuning-free approach also performs competitively with the fine-tuning variant of LLM-Pruner.

*Haochen Yuan,Yang Zhang,Xiang He,Quan Z. Sheng,Zhongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses communication inefficiency in Federated Recommendation (FR) systems due to large embedding parameters, proposing a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) framework with techniques like LoRA, Hash-based encoding, and RQ-VAE to reduce overhead while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency caused by extensive embedding parameters in FR systems, which existing studies largely ignore, hindering communication efficiency.

Method: The proposed method integrates PEFT techniques, including LoRA, Hash-based encoding, and RQ-VAE, into FR systems to reduce embedding parameter transmission.

Result: Experiments show the framework reduces communication overhead and enhances accuracy across various FR models and datasets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the PEFT-based FR framework effectively addresses embedding parameter inefficiency, offering a lightweight, adaptable solution for existing FR methods.

Abstract: With the rise of cloud-edge collaboration, recommendation services are increasingly trained in distributed environments. Federated Recommendation (FR) enables such multi-end collaborative training while preserving privacy by sharing model parameters instead of raw data. However, the large number of parameters, primarily due to the massive item embeddings, significantly hampers communication efficiency. While existing studies mainly focus on improving the efficiency of FR models, they largely overlook the issue of embedding parameter overhead. To address this gap, we propose a FR training framework with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) based embedding designed to reduce the volume of embedding parameters that need to be transmitted. Our approach offers a lightweight, plugin-style solution that can be seamlessly integrated into existing FR methods. In addition to incorporating common PEFT techniques such as LoRA and Hash-based encoding, we explore the use of Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RQ-VAE) as a novel PEFT strategy within our framework. Extensive experiments across various FR model backbones and datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces communication overhead while improving accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTs proposes a robust dual-path framework for high-dimensional multivariate time series anomaly detection, combining short-term and long-term spatiotemporal modeling with a noise-filtering fusion mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies in high-dimensional noisy time series, limiting their effectiveness in anomaly detection for industrial systems.

Method: DARTs uses a dual-path approach: a short-term path with a multi-view sparse graph learner and diffusion graph unit, and a long-term path with a multi-scale spatiotemporal graph constructor. It also employs a window-aware soft-fusion mechanism.

Result: Experiments show DARTs outperforms existing methods in detecting anomalies, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness across datasets.

Conclusion: DARTs addresses limitations in high-dimensional anomaly detection by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies and filtering noise, validated by extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTSAD) aims to accurately identify and localize complex abnormal patterns in the large-scale industrial control systems. While existing approaches excel in recognizing the distinct patterns under the low-dimensional scenarios, they often fail to robustly capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies when learning representations from the high-dimensional noisy time series. To address these limitations, we propose DARTs, a robust long short-term dual-path framework with window-aware spatiotemporal soft fusion mechanism, which can be primarily decomposed into three complementary components. Specifically, in the short-term path, we introduce a Multi-View Sparse Graph Learner and a Diffusion Multi-Relation Graph Unit that collaborate to adaptively capture hierarchical discriminative short-term spatiotemporal patterns in the high-noise time series. While in the long-term path, we design a Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Constructor to model salient long-term dynamics within the high-dimensional representation space. Finally, a window-aware spatiotemporal soft-fusion mechanism is introduced to filter the residual noise while seamlessly integrating anomalous patterns. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results across mainstream datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our proposed DARTs. A series of ablation studies are also conducted to explore the crucial design factors of our proposed components. Our code and model will be made publicly open soon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a time-frequency fusion and multi-domain cross-loss (TF-MCL) model for detecting major depressive disorder (MDD) using EEG signals, addressing limitations of existing contrastive learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised MDD detection methods rely heavily on labels, which are challenging to obtain. Existing contrastive learning methods lack specialization for EEG time-frequency data and struggle with low-semantic representations.

Method: The TF-MCL model uses a fusion mapping head (FMH) to create time-frequency hybrid representations and optimizes a multi-domain cross-loss function to enhance fusion representation learning.

Result: The model achieves significant accuracy improvements (5.87% and 9.96%) over state-of-the-art methods on MODMA and PRED+CT datasets.

Conclusion: TF-MCL effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by improving time-frequency representation synthesis and fusion, demonstrating superior performance in MDD detection.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the use of supervised detection methods of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the process of labeling MDD remains challenging. As a self-supervised learning method, contrastive learning could address the shortcomings of supervised learning methods, which are unduly reliant on labels in the context of MDD detection. However, existing contrastive learning methods are not specifically designed to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals, and their capacity to acquire low-semantic data representations is still inadequate for MDD detection tasks. To address the problem of contrastive learning method, we propose a time-frequency fusion and multi-domain cross-loss (TF-MCL) model for MDD detection. TF-MCL generates time-frequency hybrid representations through the use of a fusion mapping head (FMH), which efficiently remaps time-frequency domain information to the fusion domain, and thus can effectively enhance the model's capacity to synthesize time-frequency information. Moreover, by optimizing the multi-domain cross-loss function, the distribution of the representations in the time-frequency domain and the fusion domain is reconstructed, thereby improving the model's capacity to acquire fusion representations. We evaluated the performance of our model on the publicly available datasets MODMA and PRED+CT and show a significant improvement in accuracy, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 5.87% and 9.96%, respectively.

*Md. Hasib Ur Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Laminar Flow Hypothesis to detect adversarial jailbreaking attacks in LLMs by analyzing internal dynamics (Semantic Turbulence) using a novel zero-shot metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defenses against LLM jailbreaking attacks are inefficient or brittle, prompting the need for intrinsic, lightweight detection methods.

Method: Proposes the Laminar Flow Hypothesis and measures Semantic Turbulence via layer-wise cosine velocity variance to distinguish adversarial inputs from benign ones.

Result: Experiments show RLHF-aligned Qwen2-1.5B exhibits 75.4% increased turbulence under attack, while Gemma-2B shows a 22.0% decrease, revealing distinct safety mechanisms.

Conclusion: Semantic Turbulence is an effective real-time jailbreak detector and diagnostic tool for assessing black-box model safety architectures.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, the challenge of securing them against adversarial "jailbreaking" attacks has intensified. Current defense strategies often rely on computationally expensive external classifiers or brittle lexical filters, overlooking the intrinsic dynamics of the model's reasoning process. In this work, the Laminar Flow Hypothesis is introduced, which posits that benign inputs induce smooth, gradual transitions in an LLM's high-dimensional latent space, whereas adversarial prompts trigger chaotic, high-variance trajectories - termed Semantic Turbulence - resulting from the internal conflict between safety alignment and instruction-following objectives. This phenomenon is formalized through a novel, zero-shot metric: the variance of layer-wise cosine velocity. Experimental evaluation across diverse small language models reveals a striking diagnostic capability. The RLHF-aligned Qwen2-1.5B exhibits a statistically significant 75.4% increase in turbulence under attack (p less than 0.001), validating the hypothesis of internal conflict. Conversely, Gemma-2B displays a 22.0% decrease in turbulence, characterizing a distinct, low-entropy "reflex-based" refusal mechanism. These findings demonstrate that Semantic Turbulence serves not only as a lightweight, real-time jailbreak detector but also as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for categorizing the underlying safety architecture of black-box models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study compares embedding-based methods for financial news sentiment analysis on small datasets, finding that pretrained embeddings underperform below a critical data threshold. Overfitting due to small validation sets is highlighted, and alternative approaches like few-shot learning are recommended.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial sentiment analysis is vital for market understanding, but standard NLP methods struggle with small datasets. The study aims to evaluate embedding-based methods in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Comparative evaluation of Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformer embeddings combined with gradient boosting on manually labeled financial headlines.

Result: Models showed a gap between validation and test performance, underperforming trivial baselines. Pretrained embeddings had diminishing returns below a data sufficiency threshold, and small validation sets led to overfitting.

Conclusion: Embedding quality alone cannot overcome data scarcity. Practitioners should explore alternatives like few-shot learning, data augmentation, or hybrid methods when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis enhances market understanding; however, standard natural language processing approaches encounter significant challenges when applied to small datasets. This study provides a comparative evaluation of embedding-based methods for financial news sentiment classification in resource-constrained environments. Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformer representations are evaluated in combination with gradient boosting on manually labeled headlines. Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics. The analysis demonstrates that pretrained embeddings yield diminishing returns below a critical data sufficiency threshold, and that small validation sets contribute to overfitting during model selection. Practical application is illustrated through weekly sentiment aggregation and narrative summarization for market monitoring workflows. The findings offer empirical evidence that embedding quality alone cannot address fundamental data scarcity in sentiment classification. For practitioners operating with limited resources, the results indicate the need to consider alternative approaches such as few-shot learning, data augmentation, or lexicon-enhanced hybrid methods when labeled samples are scarce.

TL;DR: MIDUS introduces a head-wise memory layer to replace FFNs in depth up-scaling, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance depth up-scaling of large language models without excessive parameter growth or inference cost by leveraging head-wise memory.

Method: MIDUS replaces FFNs with head-wise memory layers, enabling independent memory banks for each attention head and efficient per-head value factorization.

Result: MIDUS outperforms DUS baselines, offering performance improvements with efficient parameter use.

Conclusion: MIDUS is a resource-efficient alternative to FFN replication, leveraging head-wise memory for better depth up-scaling.

Abstract: Scaling large language models (LLMs) demands approaches that increase capacity without incurring excessive parameter growth or inference cost. Depth Up-Scaling (DUS) has emerged as a promising strategy by duplicating layers and applying Continual Pre-training (CPT), but its reliance on feed-forward networks (FFNs) limits efficiency and attainable gains. We introduce Memory-Infused Depth Up-Scaling (MIDUS), which replaces FFNs in duplicated blocks with a head-wise memory (HML) layer. Motivated by observations that attention heads have distinct roles both across and within layers, MIDUS assigns an independent memory bank to each head, enabling head-wise retrieval and injecting information into subsequent layers while preserving head-wise functional structure. This design combines sparse memory access with head-wise representations and incorporates an efficient per-head value factorization module, thereby relaxing the usual efficiency-performance trade-off. Across our CPT experiments, MIDUS exhibits robust performance improvements over strong DUS baselines while maintaining a highly efficient parameter footprint. Our findings establish MIDUS as a compelling and resource-efficient alternative to conventional FFN replication for depth up-scaling by leveraging its head-wise memory design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HDA-STGNN, a hybrid deep learning framework for network-wide traffic volume estimation using speed profiles and road attributes, avoiding reliance on volume data at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either ignore unmonitored roads or depend on nearby sensor data, limiting applicability in sensor-scarce cities. Probe speeds and road attributes are more widely available.

Method: HDA-STGNN leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volumes across all road segments.

Result: Ablation studies show the model captures spatio-temporal dependencies and emphasizes topology's role in accurate estimation without volume data at inference.

Conclusion: HDA-STGNN provides a scalable solution for network-wide traffic volume estimation in sensor-scarce environments by utilizing widely available data.

Abstract: Existing traffic volume estimation methods typically address either forecasting traffic on sensor-equipped roads or spatially imputing missing volumes using nearby sensors. While forecasting models generally disregard unmonitored roads by design, spatial imputation methods explicitly address network-wide estimation; yet this approach relies on volume data at inference time, limiting its applicability in sensor-scarce cities. Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks. In this work, we present the Hybrid Directed-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HDA-STGNN), an inductive deep learning framework designed to tackle the network-wide volume estimation problem. Our approach leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volume profiles across all road segments in the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive ablation studies that demonstrate the model's capacity to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and highlight the value of topological information for accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation without relying on volume data at inference time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MV-SupGCN is a semi-supervised GCN model integrating complementary components to improve multi-view learning by combining Cross-Entropy and Supervised Contrastive loss, robust graph construction, and contrastive learning with pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view learning methods inadequately exploit complementary information across views, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Combines Cross-Entropy and Supervised Contrastive loss, robust graph construction (KNN and semi-supervised), and contrastive learning with pseudo-labeling for semantic alignment.

Result: MV-SupGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods across benchmarks.

Conclusion: MV-SupGCN's integrated approach effectively enhances multi-view learning performance.

Abstract: The advent of graph convolutional network (GCN)-based multi-view learning provides a powerful framework for integrating structural information from heterogeneous views, enabling effective modeling of complex multi-view data. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary information across views, leading to suboptimal feature representations and limited performance. To address this, we propose MV-SupGCN, a semi-supervised GCN model that integrates several complementary components with clear motivations and mutual reinforcement. First, to better capture discriminative features and improve model generalization, we design a joint loss function that combines Cross-Entropy loss with Supervised Contrastive loss, encouraging the model to simultaneously minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class separability in the latent space. Second, recognizing the instability and incompleteness of single graph construction methods, we combine both KNN-based and semi-supervised graph construction approaches on each view, thereby enhancing the robustness of the data structure representation and reducing generalization error. Third, to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled data and enhance semantic alignment across multiple views, we propose a unified framework that integrates contrastive learning in order to enforce consistency among multi-view embeddings and capture meaningful inter-view relationships, together with pseudo-labeling, which provides additional supervision applied to both the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions to enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MV-SupGCN consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our integrated approach.

*Shengfan Cao,Francesco Borrelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCPO is a sampling-based method for safe policy learning by projecting updates in parameter space, ensuring safety without gradient access to constraints, and guarantees safe intermediate policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for safety in learning policies, especially in scenarios with unknown, rollout-based constraints, ensuring performance without violating safety.

Method: Proposes SCPO, a weight-space projection using local safe regions from trajectory rollouts and smoothness bounds, projecting updates via convex SOCP.

Result: Ensures safe-by-induction policies, closed-loop stability in constrained control, and safe adaptation, proven effective in rejecting unsafe updates and maintaining feasibility.

Conclusion: SCPO successfully enforces safety in policy learning, achieving meaningful improvements while adhering to safety constraints.

Abstract: Safety-critical learning requires policies that improve performance without leaving the safe operating regime. We study constrained policy learning where model parameters must satisfy unknown, rollout-based safety constraints. We propose SCPO, a sampling-based weight-space projection method that enforces safety directly in parameter space without requiring gradient access to the constraint functions. Our approach constructs a local safe region by combining trajectory rollouts with smoothness bounds that relate parameter changes to shifts in safety metrics. Each gradient update is then projected via a convex SOCP, producing a safe first-order step. We establish a safe-by-induction guarantee: starting from any safe initialization, all intermediate policies remain safe given feasible projections. In constrained control settings with a stabilizing backup policy, our approach further ensures closed-loop stability and enables safe adaptation beyond the conservative backup. On regression with harmful supervision and a constrained double-integrator task with malicious expert, our approach consistently rejects unsafe updates, maintains feasibility throughout training, and achieves meaningful primal objective improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Disentangled Decoding Decomposition (D3), a weakly supervised method to train deep learning models for EEG signal decoding, addressing hidden overfitting issues and improving generalization to real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for EEG decoding show strong benchmark performance but fail in real-world applications due to hidden overfitting, indicating a need for methods that generalize better.

Method: The authors propose EEG-D3, a method that disentangles latent components of brain activity by predicting the trial sequence position of input windows, using a novel architecture with interpretable sub-networks.

Result: EEG-D3 successfully separates latent brain activity components, prevents overfitting, and enables few-shot learning for sleep stage classification, demonstrating improved generalization.

Conclusion: EEG-D3 provides a reliable tool for disentangling brain activity components, avoiding overfitting, and enhancing real-world applicability, with potential benefits for neuroscience research.

Abstract: Deep learning for decoding EEG signals has gained traction, with many claims to state-of-the-art accuracy. However, despite the convincing benchmark performance, successful translation to real applications is limited. The frequent disconnect between performance on controlled BCI benchmarks and its lack of generalisation to practical settings indicates hidden overfitting problems. We introduce Disentangled Decoding Decomposition (D3), a weakly supervised method for training deep learning models across EEG datasets. By predicting the place in the respective trial sequence from which the input window was sampled, EEG-D3 separates latent components of brain activity, akin to non-linear ICA. We utilise a novel model architecture with fully independent sub-networks for strict interpretability. We outline a feature interpretation paradigm to contrast the component activation profiles on different datasets and inspect the associated temporal and spatial filters. The proposed method reliably separates latent components of brain activity on motor imagery data. Training downstream classifiers on an appropriate subset of these components prevents hidden overfitting caused by task-correlated artefacts, which severely affects end-to-end classifiers. We further exploit the linearly separable latent space for effective few-shot learning on sleep stage classification. The ability to distinguish genuine components of brain activity from spurious features results in models that avoid the hidden overfitting problem and generalise well to real-world applications, while requiring only minimal labelled data. With interest to the neuroscience community, the proposed method gives researchers a tool to separate individual brain processes and potentially even uncover heretofore unknown dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about backdoor injection and malicious behavior in code generated by LLMs with minimal human oversight.

Method: CTVP verifies untrusted models by analyzing execution traces across semantically equivalent program transformations, detecting anomalies without running the code.

Result: The approach uses ARQ to show exponential growth in verification cost with orbit size and proves non-gamifiability due to space complexity constraints.

Conclusion: Semantic orbit analysis offers a scalable and theoretically sound method for AI control in code generation, ensuring robustness against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate code with minimal human oversight, raising critical concerns about backdoor injection and malicious behavior. We present Cross-Trace Verification Protocol (CTVP), a novel AI control framework that verifies untrusted code-generating models through semantic orbit analysis. Rather than directly executing potentially malicious code, CTVP leverages the model's own predictions of execution traces across semantically equivalent program transformations. By analyzing consistency patterns in these predicted traces, we detect behavioral anomalies indicative of backdoors. Our approach introduces the Adversarial Robustness Quotient (ARQ), which quantifies the computational cost of verification relative to baseline generation, demonstrating exponential growth with orbit size. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic bounds showing non-gamifiability -- adversaries cannot improve through training due to fundamental space complexity constraints. This work demonstrates that semantic orbit analysis provides a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to AI control for code generation tasks.

*Shicheng Liu,Siyuan Xu,Wenjie Qiu,Hangfan Zhang,Minghui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores improving RLHF for LM alignment by identifying and correcting causes of unsatisfactory responses, using post-hoc explanations and an unlearning method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans often improve outcomes by addressing their causes; the paper investigates applying this strategy to enhance RLHF-aligned LMs, which sometimes produce unsatisfactory responses.

Method: Proposes two parts: (1) a post-hoc explanation method identifying problematic training data via constrained combinatorial optimization, solved with an iterative algorithm; (2) an unlearning method to remove problematic data without harming good responses.

Result: Experiments show the algorithm effectively improves RLHF-aligned LMs by addressing causes of poor responses.

Conclusion: The approach successfully applies human-like problem-solving to LM alignment, demonstrating practical improvement in RLHF outcomes.

Abstract: A common and effective strategy for humans to improve an unsatisfactory outcome in daily life is to find a cause of this outcome and correct the cause. In this paper, we investigate whether this human improvement strategy can be applied to improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for alignment of language models (LMs). In particular, it is observed in the literature that LMs tuned by RLHF can still output unsatisfactory responses. This paper proposes a method to improve the unsatisfactory responses by correcting their causes. Our method has two parts. The first part proposes a post-hoc explanation method to explain why an unsatisfactory response is generated to a prompt by identifying the training data that lead to this response. We formulate this problem as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find a set of training data closest to this prompt-response pair in a feature representation space, and the constraint is that the prompt-response pair can be decomposed as a convex combination of this set of training data in the feature space. We propose an efficient iterative data selection algorithm to solve this problem. The second part proposes an unlearning method that improves unsatisfactory responses to some prompts by unlearning the training data that lead to these unsatisfactory responses and, meanwhile, does not significantly degrade satisfactory responses to other prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can improve RLHF.

Motivation: GNNs are standard for graph representation learning but lack robustness to structural perturbations.

Method: Combines GIN architectures with multi-scale topological features from persistence images, using Hiraoka-Kusano-inspired stability constraints.

Result: Demonstrates exceptional robustness to edge perturbations (0-4% degradation) and outperforms baselines in stability while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretically-grounded and empirically-validated approach for robust graph learning with topological regularization.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the standard for graph representation learning but remain vulnerable to structural perturbations. We propose a novel framework that integrates persistent homology features with stability regularization to enhance robustness. Building on the stability theorems of persistent homology \cite{cohen2007stability}, our method combines GIN architectures with multi-scale topological features extracted from persistence images, enforced by Hiraoka-Kusano-inspired stability constraints. Across six diverse datasets spanning biochemical, social, and collaboration networks , our approach demonstrates exceptional robustness to edge perturbations while maintaining competitive accuracy. Notably, we observe minimal performance degradation (0-4\% on most datasets) under perturbation, significantly outperforming baseline stability. Our work provides both a theoretically-grounded and empirically-validated approach to robust graph learning that aligns with recent advances in topological regularization

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how dropout in neural networks resembles percolation in statistical physics, showing that removing connections can disrupt learning if paths between input and output vanish.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of dropout-induced percolation on neural network training, especially when connections are randomly removed.

Method: The authors study percolation models mimicking dropout, analyze network topology effects, and investigate training breakdowns in networks without biases.

Result: The study confirms a percolative effect in dropout and identifies conditions under which training breaks down due to insufficient connectivity.

Conclusion: Dropout's percolative effect can disrupt training, particularly in networks without biases, suggesting careful tuning of dropout rates.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the existence and effect of percolation in training deep Neural Networks (NNs) with dropout. Dropout methods are regularisation techniques for training NNs, first introduced by G. Hinton et al. (2012). These methods temporarily remove connections in the NN, randomly at each stage of training, and update the remaining subnetwork with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics.
  If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data. We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem. The theory shows the existence of a percolative effect in dropout. We also show that this percolative effect can cause a breakdown when training NNs without biases with dropout; and we argue heuristically that this breakdown extends to NNs with biases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating L₁ calibration error from finite datasets efficiently and without restrictive assumptions.

Method: Presents two contributions: an upper bound for classifiers with bounded variation calibration functions, and a method to modify classifiers for efficient calibration error upper bounding.

Result: Develops practical, efficient procedures applicable to real-world datasets with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Offers actionable advice for measuring calibration error in practice, ensuring practical utility.

Abstract: We make two contributions to the problem of estimating the $L_1$ calibration error of a binary classifier from a finite dataset. First, we provide an upper bound for any classifier where the calibration function has bounded variation. Second, we provide a method of modifying any classifier so that its calibration error can be upper bounded efficiently without significantly impacting classifier performance and without any restrictive assumptions. All our results are non-asymptotic and distribution-free. We conclude by providing advice on how to measure calibration error in practice. Our methods yield practical procedures that can be run on real-world datasets with modest overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns, noise sensitivity, and domain shifts in infant cry classification while enabling practical deployment.

Method: Combines denoising autoencoders, a convolutional tokenizer, and a Transformer encoder trained with communication-efficient federated learning, including on-device denoising and adaptive segmentation.

Result: Achieves a macro F1 score of 0.938, AUC of 0.962, and low ECE (0.032), with reduced client upload size (3.3 MB) and real-time edge inference (96 ms per frame).

Conclusion: The system offers a viable solution for privacy-preserving, noise-robust, and efficient infant cry classification.

Abstract: Infant cry classification can aid early assessment of infant needs. However, deployment of such solutions is limited by privacy concerns around audio data, sensitivity to background noise, and domain shift across recording environments. We present an end-to-end infant cry analysis pipeline that integrates a denoising autoencoder (DAE), a convolutional tokenizer, and a Transformer encoder trained using communication-efficient federated learning (FL). The system performs on-device denoising, adaptive segmentation, post hoc calibration, and energy-based out-of-distribution (OOD) abstention. Federated training employs a regularized control variate update with 8-bit adapter deltas under secure aggregation. Using the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets with ESC-50 noise overlays, the model achieves a macro F1 score of 0.938, an AUC of 0.962, and an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.032, while reducing per-round client upload from approximately 36 to 42 MB to 3.3 MB. Real-time edge inference on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4 GB, TensorRT FP16) achieves 96 ms per one-second spectrogram frame. These results demonstrate a practical path toward privacy-preserving, noise-robust, and communication-efficient infant cry classification suitable for federated deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OPTIMA is a scalable one-shot post-training pruning method that uses row-wise QPs with shared Hessians to balance accuracy and efficiency, improving LLM performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between accuracy and scalability in post-training pruning methods for large language models.

Method: Introduces OPTIMA, which formulates layer-wise weight reconstruction as row-wise QPs with a shared Hessian, enabling efficient parallel solving.

Result: Achieves up to 3.97% accuracy improvement and prunes an 8B-parameter transformer in 40 hours with 60GB memory.

Conclusion: OPTIMA sets a new state-of-the-art for accuracy-efficiency trade-offs in one-shot post-training pruning.

Abstract: Post-training model pruning is a promising solution, yet it faces a trade-off: simple heuristics that zero weights are fast but degrade accuracy, while principled joint optimization methods recover accuracy but are computationally infeasible at modern scale. One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement. On an NVIDIA H100, OPTIMA prunes a 8B-parameter transformer end-to-end in 40 hours with 60GB peak memory. Together, these results set a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for one-shot post-training pruning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current inference-time strategies for long-context LLMs show diminishing returns due to score dilution in static self-attention. A method using targeted gradient updates on context outperforms, improving benchmarks by 12.6-14.1 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in long-context LLMs, their performance is limited by inefficient use of long contexts and diminishing returns from inference-time compute strategies like generating thinking tokens.

Method: Introduces a simple method using targeted gradient updates on the given context to overcome limitations of static self-attention, outperforming current inference-time strategies.

Result: Significant improvements (12.6-14.1 percentage points) on Qwen3-4B across LongBench-v2 and ZeroScrolls benchmarks.

Conclusion: Context-specific training during inference is more effective than current inference-time scaling strategies for long-context LLMs.

Abstract: Progress on training and architecture strategies has enabled LLMs with millions of tokens in context length. However, empirical evidence suggests that such long-context LLMs can consume far more text than they can reliably use. On the other hand, it has been shown that inference-time compute can be used to scale performance of LLMs, often by generating thinking tokens, on challenging tasks involving multi-step reasoning. Through controlled experiments on sandbox long-context tasks, we find that such inference-time strategies show rapidly diminishing returns and fail at long context. We attribute these failures to score dilution, a phenomenon inherent to static self-attention. Further, we show that current inference-time strategies cannot retrieve relevant long-context signals under certain conditions. We propose a simple method that, through targeted gradient updates on the given context, provably overcomes limitations of static self-attention. We find that this shift in how inference-time compute is spent leads to consistently large performance improvements across models and long-context benchmarks. Our method leads to large 12.6 and 14.1 percentage point improvements for Qwen3-4B on average across subsets of LongBench-v2 and ZeroScrolls benchmarks. The takeaway is practical: for long context, a small amount of context-specific training is a better use of inference compute than current inference-time scaling strategies like producing more thinking tokens.

TL;DR: The study compares ML and DL models for precipitation forecasting in South America, finding LSTM outperforms traditional methods like BAM, with XGBoost offering a cost-effective alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate precipitation forecasts are crucial for societal preparedness. AI and ML offer potential improvements over traditional dynamic modeling, but their feasibility lacks broad investigation.

Method: The research evaluates classical ML (Random Forests, XGBoost) and DL (CNN 1D, LSTM, GRU) models for forecasting precipitation in South America across 2019 seasons, comparing them to the traditional BAM model. XAI is used to interpret model behaviors.

Result: LSTM achieved the highest accuracy, especially for heavy precipitation, despite higher latency. XGBoost provided a balance between accuracy and computational cost. BAM performed worst among the tested models.

Conclusion: DL models, particularly LSTM, are viable for climate forecasting, aligning with trends in meteorological centers. XGBoost is a practical alternative when cost is a concern.

Abstract: Forecasting meteorological variables is challenging due to the complexity of their processes, requiring advanced models for accuracy. Accurate precipitation forecasts are vital for society. Reliable predictions help communities mitigate climatic impacts. Based on the current relevance of artificial intelligence (AI), classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been used as an alternative or complement to dynamic modeling. However, there is still a lack of broad investigations into the feasibility of purely data-driven approaches for precipitation forecasting. This study aims at addressing this issue where different classical ML and DL approaches for forecasting precipitation in South America, taking into account all 2019 seasons, are considered in a detailed investigation. The selected classical ML techniques were Random Forests and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), while the DL counterparts were a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN 1D), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. Additionally, the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM) was used as a representative of the traditional dynamic modeling approach. We also relied on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide some explanations for the models behaviors. LSTM showed strong predictive performance while BAM, the traditional dynamic model representative, had the worst results. Despite presented the higher latency, LSTM was most accurate for heavy precipitation. If cost is a concern, XGBoost offers lower latency with slightly accuracy loss. The results of this research confirm the viability of DL models for climate forecasting, solidifying a global trend in major meteorological and climate forecasting centers.

TL;DR: A neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data can reproduce dynamics in correlated regimes but fails in anti-correlated or uncorrelated ones, highlighting the need for memory-dependent kernels in certain regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing methods like TD2RDM in capturing quantum dynamics across different regimes by leveraging machine learning.

Method: A neural ODE model is trained on exact 2RDM data to predict dynamics without explicit three-particle information, testing its performance in correlated and uncorrelated regimes.

Result: The neural ODE succeeds in correlated regimes but fails otherwise, showing the importance of three-particle-correlation buildup and the need for memory-dependent kernels.

Conclusion: The neural ODE serves as a diagnostic tool for identifying the applicability of cumulant expansion methods and suggests pathways for non-local closure schemes in quantum simulations.

Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems exhibit rapid correlation buildup that underlies many emerging phenomena. Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances digital twin adaptability and value realization in civil engineering, offering practical benefits for infrastructure monitoring and maintenance.

Abstract: This work shows how adaptivity can enhance value realization of digital twins in civil engineering. We focus on adapting the state transition models within digital twins represented through probabilistic graphical models. The bi-directional interaction between the physical and virtual domains is modeled using dynamic Bayesian networks. By treating state transition probabilities as random variables endowed with conjugate priors, we enable hierarchical online learning of transition dynamics from a state to another through effortless Bayesian updates. We provide the mathematical framework to account for a larger class of distributions with respect to the current literature. To compute dynamic policies with precision updates we solve parametric Markov decision processes through reinforcement learning. The proposed adaptive digital twin framework enjoys enhanced personalization, increased robustness, and improved cost-effectiveness. We assess our approach on a case study involving structural health monitoring and maintenance planning of a railway bridge.

Conclusion: SWR and Phalanx layers offer efficient, high-performance alternatives for multi-hybrid architectures.

Abstract: Multi-hybrid architectures are poised to take over language modeling due to better quality and performance. We introduce a hierarchical decomposition framework for linear recurrences that allows us to develop algorithms aligned with GPU memory hierarchies, yielding Sliding Window Recurrences. We focus specifically on truncating recurrences to hardware-aligned windows which are naturally jagged, limiting costly inter-warp communication. Using SWR, we develop Phalanx layers that serve as drop-in replacements for windowed attention or linear recurrences. In 1B parameter multi-hybrid models, Phalanx achieves over 10-40% speedup across 4K to 32K context length over optimized Transformers while matching perplexity.

Abstract: Spherical equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) provide a principled framework for learning on three-dimensional molecular and biomolecular systems, where predictions must respect the rotational symmetries inherent in physics. These models extend traditional message-passing GNNs and Transformers by representing node and edge features as spherical tensors that transform under irreducible representations of the rotation group SO(3), ensuring that predictions change in physically meaningful ways under rotations of the input. This guide develops a complete, intuitive foundation for spherical equivariant modeling - from group representations and spherical harmonics, to tensor products, Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, and the construction of SO(3)-equivariant kernels. Building on this foundation, we construct the Tensor Field Network and SE(3)-Transformer architectures and explain how they perform equivariant message-passing and attention on geometric graphs. Through clear mathematical derivations and annotated code excerpts, this guide serves as a self-contained introduction for researchers and learners seeking to understand or implement spherical EGNNs for applications in chemistry, molecular property prediction, protein structure modeling, and generative modeling.

Method: RePo uses a differentiable module to assign positions based on contextual dependencies, trained on OLMo-2 1B.

Result: RePo improves performance on noisy contexts, structured data, and longer contexts while staying competitive on short-context tasks.

Conclusion: RePo effectively reduces cognitive load and enhances attention allocation by capturing contextual structure.

Abstract: In-context learning is fundamental to modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, prevailing architectures impose a rigid and fixed contextual structure by assigning linear or constant positional indices. Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_φ$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

*Qi Chen,Fabio Ramos,Alán Aspuru-Guzik,Florian Shkurti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a likelihood-free Bayesian Optimization (BO) method for molecular discovery, leveraging LLMs and chemistry foundation models to enhance efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BO methods struggle in low-data regimes and vast candidate spaces, and existing LLM and foundation model priors are underutilized due to high-dimensional features and computational costs.

Method: Proposes a likelihood-free BO method that skips explicit surrogate modeling, uses priors from LLMs and chemistry models, and employs tree-structured search space partitioning with Monte Carlo Tree Search and LLM-based clustering.

Result: The method significantly improves scalability, robustness, and sample efficiency in molecular discovery, as demonstrated through experiments and ablations.

Conclusion: The likelihood-free BO approach effectively addresses limitations of traditional BO, leveraging LLMs and foundation models to enhance molecular discovery.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a key methodology for accelerating molecular discovery by estimating the mapping from molecules to their properties while seeking the optimal candidate. Typically, BO iteratively updates a probabilistic surrogate model of this mapping and optimizes acquisition functions derived from the model to guide molecule selection. However, its performance is limited in low-data regimes with insufficient prior knowledge and vast candidate spaces. Large language models (LLMs) and chemistry foundation models offer rich priors to enhance BO, but high-dimensional features, costly in-context learning, and the computational burden of deep Bayesian surrogates hinder their full utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a likelihood-free BO method that bypasses explicit surrogate modeling and directly leverages priors from general LLMs and chemistry-specific foundation models to inform acquisition functions. Our method also learns a tree-structured partition of the molecular search space with local acquisition functions, enabling efficient candidate selection via Monte Carlo Tree Search. By further incorporating coarse-grained LLM-based clustering, it substantially improves scalability to large candidate sets by restricting acquisition function evaluations to clusters with statistically higher property values. We show through extensive experiments and ablations that the proposed method substantially improves scalability, robustness, and sample efficiency in LLM-guided BO for molecular discovery.

*Qingao Yi,Jiaang Duan,Hanwen Hu,Qin Hua,Haiyan Zhao,Shiyou Qian,Dingyu Yang,Jian Cao,Jinghua Tang,Yinghao Yu,Chenzhi Liao,Kangjin Wang,Liping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDGC is a dynamic gradient compression framework for LLM training that adjusts compression rates based on gradient entropy, reducing communication overhead and training time without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static gradient compression methods neglect dynamic gradient evolution during LLM training, leading to performance issues. EDGC addresses this gap by considering gradient entropy trends for more efficient compression.

Method: EDGC uses down-sampling for gradient entropy estimation, a theoretical model linking entropy to compression rates, and a window-based adjustment mechanism for dynamic rate adaptation across pipeline stages.

Result: Implemented on GPU clusters, EDGC reduced communication latency by up to 46.45% and training time by 16.13% while maintaining model accuracy for GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B.

Conclusion: EDGC effectively balances compression efficiency and error, offering a practical solution to accelerate LLM training without compromising performance.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PGDM improves multivariate time series forecasting by leveraging recurring patterns, outperforming baselines with significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models often ignore recurring structures in time series data, limiting their forecasting accuracy.

Method: PGDM uses archetypal analysis to extract patterns, guides predictions with estimated next patterns, and scales guidance based on uncertainty.

Result: PGDM achieves up to 40.67% and 56.26% performance improvements in MAE/CRPS for visual field and motion capture data, respectively.

Conclusion: PGDM effectively integrates pattern guidance into diffusion models, enhancing forecasting accuracy and outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promise in forecasting future data from multivariate time series. However, few existing methods account for recurring structures, or patterns, that appear within the data. We present Pattern-Guided Diffusion Models (PGDM), which leverage inherent patterns within temporal data for forecasting future time steps. PGDM first extracts patterns using archetypal analysis and estimates the most likely next pattern in the sequence. By guiding predictions with this pattern estimate, PGDM makes more realistic predictions that fit within the set of known patterns. We additionally introduce a novel uncertainty quantification technique based on archetypal analysis, and we dynamically scale the guidance level based on the pattern estimate uncertainty. We apply our method to two well-motivated forecasting applications, predicting visual field measurements and motion capture frames. On both, we show that pattern guidance improves PGDM's performance (MAE / CRPS) by up to 40.67% / 56.26% and 14.12% / 14.10%, respectively. PGDM also outperforms baselines by up to 65.58% / 84.83% and 93.64% / 92.55%.

*Cindy Y. Zhang,Elif Ertekin,Peter Orbanz,Ryan P. Adams*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new ML architecture adapts weights to enforce invariance to any space group, improving material property prediction and zero-shot learning for unseen groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact symmetry invariance in ML models requires custom architectures, limiting scalability and knowledge transfer, especially for the 230 space groups in materials science.

Method: Construct symmetry-adapted Fourier bases and encode constraints into a neural network layer for automatic weight adaptation and weight sharing across space groups.

Result: Competitive performance on material property prediction and successful zero-shot learning generalization to unseen groups.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses scalability and data sparsity challenges in modeling crystallographic symmetries.

Abstract: Incorporating known symmetries in data into machine learning models has consistently improved predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization. However, achieving exact invariance to specific symmetries typically requires designing bespoke architectures for each group of symmetries, limiting scalability and preventing knowledge transfer across related symmetries. In the case of the space groups, symmetries critical to modeling crystalline solids in materials science and condensed matter physics, this challenge is particularly salient as there are 230 such groups in three dimensions. In this work we present a new approach to such crystallographic symmetries by developing a single machine learning architecture that is capable of adapting its weights automatically to enforce invariance to any input space group. Our approach is based on constructing symmetry-adapted Fourier bases through an explicit characterization of constraints that group operations impose on Fourier coefficients. Encoding these constraints into a neural network layer enables weight sharing across different space groups, allowing the model to leverage structural similarities between groups and overcome data sparsity when limited measurements are available for specific groups. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving competitive performance on material property prediction tasks and performing zero-shot learning to generalize to unseen groups.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in studying MHC-II antigenic epitopes by introducing a well-curated dataset and defining three machine learning tasks for peptide and antigen presentation. It provides a multi-scale evaluation framework and modular analysis to advance computational immunotherapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the complexity and lack of standardized data in MHC-II epitope research, which lags behind MHC-I studies, by offering a comprehensive dataset and methodological framework.

Method: The authors curate a dataset from the IEDB and other sources, standardize it, and introduce a novel antigen-MHC-II dataset. They define three ML tasks (peptide binding, presentation, and antigen presentation) and use a multi-scale evaluation and modular framework for benchmarking and analysis.

Result: The work provides a valuable dataset and benchmarks existing models, offering insights into modeling designs for MHC-II epitope prediction.

Conclusion: This research advances computational immunotherapy by providing foundational resources and methodologies for future ML-guided epitope discovery and immune response prediction.

Abstract: Antigenic epitope presented by major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) proteins plays an essential role in immunotherapy. However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide-MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen-MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark existing models, along with a comprehensive analysis over various modeling designs to this problem with a modular framework. Overall, this work serves as a valuable resource for advancing computational immunotherapy, providing a foundation for future research in ML guided epitope discovery and predictive modeling of immune responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathology models focus on morphological data, missing critical molecular layers. EXAONE Path 2.5 aims to capture the full biological landscape for better cancer progression understanding.

Method: The model uses multimodal SigLIP loss for contrastive learning, F-RoPE for spatial preservation, and domain-specialized internal models for robust multimodal alignment.

Result: EXAONE Path 2.5 matches state-of-the-art models on Patho-Bench and excels in real-world clinical adaptability, showcasing high data and parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrated multimodal modeling, as demonstrated by EXAONE Path 2.5, holds significant promise for advancing precision oncology by combining genotype-to-phenotype insights.

Abstract: Cancer progression arises from interactions across multiple biological layers, especially beyond morphological and across molecular layers that remain invisible to image-only models. To capture this broader biological landscape, we present EXAONE Path 2.5, a pathology foundation model that jointly models histologic, genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic modalities, producing an integrated patient representation that reflects tumor biology more comprehensively. Our approach incorporates three key components: (1) multimodal SigLIP loss enabling all-pairwise contrastive learning across heterogeneous modalities, (2) a fragment-aware rotary positional encoding (F-RoPE) module that preserves spatial structure and tissue-fragment topology in WSI, and (3) domain-specialized internal foundation models for both WSI and RNA-seq to provide biologically grounded embeddings for robust multimodal alignment. We evaluate EXAONE Path 2.5 against six leading pathology foundation models across two complementary benchmarks: an internal real-world clinical dataset and the Patho-Bench benchmark covering 80 tasks. Our framework demonstrates high data and parameter efficiency, achieving on-par performance with state-of-the-art foundation models on Patho-Bench while exhibiting the highest adaptability in the internal clinical setting. These results highlight the value of biologically informed multimodal design and underscore the potential of integrated genotype-to-phenotype modeling for next-generation precision oncology.

TL;DR: FusAD is a unified time series analysis framework integrating adaptive time-frequency fusion and denoising to outperform state-of-the-art models in classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series models lack multi-task compatibility and struggle with noise and diverse data types, prompting the need for a robust, unified framework.

Method: FusAD combines Fourier and Wavelet transforms for global-local feature capture, adaptive denoising, and masked pre-training for multi-granularity representation learning.

Result: FusAD surpasses state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmarks, excelling in classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection.

Conclusion: FusAD offers an efficient, scalable, and adaptable solution for diverse time series tasks, addressing key challenges in noise and feature extraction.

Abstract: Time series analysis plays a vital role in fields such as finance, healthcare, industry, and meteorology, underpinning key tasks including classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection. Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable progress in these areas in recent years, constructing an efficient, multi-task compatible, and generalizable unified framework for time series analysis remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches are often tailored to single tasks or specific data types, making it difficult to simultaneously handle multi-task modeling and effectively integrate information across diverse time series types. Moreover, real-world data are often affected by noise, complex frequency components, and multi-scale dynamic patterns, which further complicate robust feature extraction and analysis. To ameliorate these challenges, we propose FusAD, a unified analysis framework designed for diverse time series tasks. FusAD features an adaptive time-frequency fusion mechanism, integrating both Fourier and Wavelet transforms to efficiently capture global-local and multi-scale dynamic features. With an adaptive denoising mechanism, FusAD automatically senses and filters various types of noise, highlighting crucial sequence variations and enabling robust feature extraction in complex environments. In addition, the framework integrates a general information fusion and decoding structure, combined with masked pre-training, to promote efficient learning and transfer of multi-granularity representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FusAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on mainstream time series benchmarks for classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks, while maintaining high efficiency and scalability.

TL;DR: SonicMoE introduces memory-efficient algorithms and optimized GPU kernels to improve the efficiency of Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, reducing activation memory by 45% and achieving faster compute throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models face challenges like increased activation memory and reduced hardware efficiency due to high expert granularity and sparsity, necessitating solutions for better performance.

Method: Proposes a memory-efficient algorithm for forward/backward passes, GPU kernels overlapping IO with computation, and a 'token rounding' method to minimize wasted compute.

Result: SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45%, achieves 1.86x compute throughput improvement, and matches ScatterMoE's training efficiency with fewer GPUs.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations significantly enhance MoE model training efficiency, with open-sourced kernels benefiting the broader community.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as the de facto architecture for scaling up language models without significantly increasing the computational cost. Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel "token rounding" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE. Concretely, SonicMoE on 64 H100s achieves a training throughput of 213 billion tokens per day comparable to ScatterMoE's 225 billion tokens per day on 96 H100s for a 7B MoE model training with FSDP-2 using the lm-engine codebase. Under high MoE sparsity settings, our tile-aware token rounding algorithm yields an additional 1.16x speedup on kernel execution time compared to vanilla top-$K$ routing while maintaining similar downstream performance. We open-source all our kernels to enable faster MoE model training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces derivative-informed Fourier neural operators (DIFNOs) for PDE-constrained optimization, showing superior accuracy in operator learning and optimization compared to conventional FNOs by leveraging derivative information during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires precise surrogate Fréchet derivatives, motivating the development of DIFNOs to emulate both operator responses and sensitivities.

Method: DIFNOs are trained by minimizing prediction errors on both output and Fréchet derivative samples. Efficient training schemes, including dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques, reduce computational costs.

Result: Theoretical results confirm FNOs' capability for derivative-informed operator learning. Numerical tests highlight DIFNOs' superior sample efficiency in solving PDE-constrained problems.

Conclusion: DIFNOs outperform conventional FNOs in accuracy and efficiency for operator learning and PDE-constrained optimization, validated by theoretical and numerical results.

Abstract: We present approximation theories and efficient training methods for derivative-informed Fourier neural operators (DIFNOs) with applications to PDE-constrained optimization. A DIFNO is an FNO trained by minimizing its prediction error jointly on output and Fréchet derivative samples of a high-fidelity operator (e.g., a parametric PDE solution operator). As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fréchet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fréchet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization. Furthermore, we develop efficient training schemes using dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques that significantly reduce memory and computational costs for Fréchet derivative learning. Numerical examples on nonlinear diffusion--reaction, Helmholtz, and Navier--Stokes equations demonstrate that DIFNOs are superior in sample complexity for operator learning and solving infinite-dimensional PDE-constrained inverse problems, achieving high accuracy at low training sample sizes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern neural networks are increasingly memory-bound, with inference throughput limited by DRAM bandwidth rather than computational power. AIQ aims to address this by optimizing arithmetic intensity.

Method: AIQ uses a search algorithm to determine per-layer quantization bit-widths, minimizing a combined loss function of arithmetic intensity and accuracy, applied as a post-training method.

Result: AIQ increases arithmetic intensity by ~50% while keeping accuracy loss within ~1 percentage point. On MobileNetV2, it achieves a 1.66x throughput boost over FP32.

Conclusion: AIQ effectively balances arithmetic intensity and accuracy, naturally quantizing larger layers more aggressively to optimize performance in memory-bound scenarios.

Abstract: As modern neural networks become increasingly memory-bound, inference throughput is limited by DRAM bandwidth rather than compute. We present Arithmetic-Intensity-Aware Quantization (AIQ), a mixed precision quantization framework that chooses per-layer bit-widths to maximize arithmetic intensity (AI) while minimizing accuracy loss. AIQ is a post-training quantization method that uses search algorithms over per-layer quantization schemes to minimize a weighted loss over AI and accuracy. On ResNet-20/CIFAR-10, AIQ increases AI by ~50% over an FP32 baseline while keeping test accuracy within ~1 percentage point, and outperforming global uniform quantization schemes. On a memory-bound MobileNetV2 architecture, AIQ configurations give a 1.66x higher throughput than the FP32 baseline while keeping test accuracy within 1 percentage point. We also find that AIQ naturally quantizes larger layers more aggressively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of serving Any-to-Any models, which introduce heterogeneity in request types, computation paths, and scaling.

Method: Cornserve enables developers to describe computation graphs and automates deployment planning, disaggregating models as needed. Its distributed runtime efficiently handles heterogeneity.

Result: Cornserve delivers up to 3.81x throughput improvement and up to 5.79x tail latency reduction over existing solutions.

Conclusion: Cornserve effectively serves diverse Any-to-Any models, outperforming current systems in efficiency and performance.

Abstract: We present Cornserve, an efficient online serving system for an emerging class of multimodal models called Any-to-Any models. Any-to-Any models accept combinations of text and multimodal data (e.g., image, video, audio) as input and also generate combinations of text and multimodal data as output, introducing request type, computation path, and computation scaling heterogeneity in model serving.
  Cornserve allows model developers to describe the computation graph of generic Any-to-Any models, which consists of heterogeneous components such as multimodal encoders, autoregressive models like Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal generators like Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Given this, Cornserve's planner automatically finds an optimized deployment plan for the model, including whether and how to disaggregate the model into smaller components based on model and workload characteristics. Cornserve's distributed runtime then executes the model per the plan, efficiently handling Any-to-Any model heterogeneity during online serving. Evaluations show that Cornserve can efficiently serve diverse Any-to-Any models and workloads, delivering up to 3.81$\times$ throughput improvement and up to 5.79$\times$ tail latency reduction over existing solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism (S-GRPO) to improve alignment of LLMs with human preferences, outperforming traditional methods like supervised fine-tuning and extending frameworks like GRPO and DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing reward models in RLHF, which rely on heuristic estimations and may not ensure stable or high-quality alignment with human values.

Method: The method introduces S-GRPO, a supervised variant of GRPO, which uses formal logical consistency for reward modeling and jointly optimizes generation, KL-divergence, and label-based objectives.

Result: S-GRPO outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning in performance and robustness and extends preference-learning frameworks like GRPO and DPO.

Conclusion: The proposed logic-based reward mechanism offers a more flexible and adaptive approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences, enhancing both stability and performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. However, the quality and stability of the trained reward model largely determine the final alignment performance. Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors.
  In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling. Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences. Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework. S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.
  Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness. Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training.

TL;DR: PathFinder is a novel deep learning architecture for radio path loss prediction that addresses issues like passive environmental modeling and poor generalization in multi-transmitter scenarios, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based RPP methods fail to proactively model environments, handle multi-transmitter scenarios, or generalize well under distribution shifts, especially when training and testing environments differ.

Method: Proposes PathFinder, which uses disentangled feature encoding for active environmental modeling, Mask-Guided Low-rank Attention, and a Transmitter-Oriented Mixup strategy. Introduces the S2MT-RPP benchmark for evaluation.

Result: PathFinder significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in multi-transmitter scenarios.

Conclusion: PathFinder successfully addresses key limitations in RPP methods, demonstrating robustness and superior performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Radio path loss prediction (RPP) is critical for optimizing 5G networks and enabling IoT, smart city, and similar applications. However, current deep learning-based RPP methods lack proactive environmental modeling, struggle with realistic multi-transmitter scenarios, and generalize poorly under distribution shifts, particularly when training/testing environments differ in building density or transmitter configurations. This paper identifies three key issues: (1) passive environmental modeling that overlooks transmitters and key environmental features; (2) overemphasis on single-transmitter scenarios despite real-world multi-transmitter prevalence; (3) excessive focus on in-distribution performance while neglecting distribution shift challenges. To address these, we propose PathFinder, a novel architecture that actively models buildings and transmitters via disentangled feature encoding and integrates Mask-Guided Low-rank Attention to independently focus on receiver and building regions. We also introduce a Transmitter-Oriented Mixup strategy for robust training and a new benchmark, single-to-multi-transmitter RPP (S2MT-RPP), tailored to evaluate extrapolation performance (multi-transmitter testing after single-transmitter training). Experimental results show PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly, especially in challenging multi-transmitter scenarios.

Motivation: To enhance data efficiency in DAL by exploring adversarial inputs that violate robustness constraints.

Method: Augmenting training data with adversarial examples generated via formal verification, applied to DAL techniques and a new proposed technique.

Result: Adversarial examples from formal verification significantly improve model generalization across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating adversarial inputs through formal verification enhances DAL performance effectively.

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) aims to reduce labeling costs in neural-network training by prioritizing the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation. Beyond selecting which samples to label, several DAL approaches further enhance data efficiency by augmenting the training set with synthetic inputs that do not require additional manual labeling. In this work, we investigate how augmenting the training data with adversarial inputs that violate robustness constraints can improve DAL performance. We show that adversarial examples generated via formal verification contribute substantially more than those produced by standard, gradient-based attacks. We apply this extension to multiple modern DAL techniques, as well as to a new technique that we propose, and show that it yields significant improvements in model generalization across standard benchmarks.

Result: Empirical results show high-quality samples in fewer steps and competitive Frechet inception distance scores, with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework is computationally cheap and effective for high-speed generation tasks.

Abstract: This paper motivates the use of random-bridges -- stochastic processes conditioned to take target distributions at fixed timepoints -- in the realm of generative modelling. Herein, random-bridges can act as stochastic transports between two probability distributions when appropriately initialized, and can display either Markovian or non-Markovian, and either continuous, discontinuous or hybrid patterns depending on the driving process. We show how one can start from general probabilistic statements and then branch out into specific representations for learning and simulation algorithms in terms of information processing. Our empirical results, built on Gaussian random bridges, produce high-quality samples in significantly fewer steps compared to traditional approaches, while achieving competitive Frechet inception distance scores. Our analysis provides evidence that the proposed framework is computationally cheap and suitable for high-speed generation tasks.

TL;DR: Hyper++ stabilizes hyperbolic deep RL training by addressing gradient issues and outperforms prior methods in terms of stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic feature spaces are suitable for RL due to their hierarchical and relational capture, but face optimization challenges from nonstationarity.

Method: Analyzes gradients in hyperbolic models, introduces Hyper++ with stable critic training, feature regularization, and optimized hyperbolic layers.

Result: Hyper++ ensures stable learning, outperforms prior hyperbolic agents, reduces wall-clock time by ~30%, and excels on Atari-5 with Double DQN.

Conclusion: Hyper++ successfully addresses gradient instability in hyperbolic RL, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The performance of reinforcement learning (RL) agents depends critically on the quality of the underlying feature representations. Hyperbolic feature spaces are well-suited for this purpose, as they naturally capture hierarchical and relational structure often present in complex RL environments. However, leveraging these spaces commonly faces optimization challenges due to the nonstationarity of RL. In this work, we identify key factors that determine the success and failure of training hyperbolic deep RL agents. By analyzing the gradients of core operations in the Poincaré Ball and Hyperboloid models of hyperbolic geometry, we show that large-norm embeddings destabilize gradient-based training, leading to trust-region violations in proximal policy optimization (PPO). Based on these insights, we introduce Hyper++, a new hyperbolic PPO agent that consists of three components: (i) stable critic training through a categorical value loss instead of regression; (ii) feature regularization guaranteeing bounded norms while avoiding the curse of dimensionality from clipping; and (iii) using a more optimization-friendly formulation of hyperbolic network layers. In experiments on ProcGen, we show that Hyper++ guarantees stable learning, outperforms prior hyperbolic agents, and reduces wall-clock time by approximately 30%. On Atari-5 with Double DQN, Hyper++ strongly outperforms Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines. We release our code at https://github.com/Probabilistic-and-Interactive-ML/hyper-rl .

*Marthe Ballon,Andres Algaba,Brecht Verbeken,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'LLM compare,' a scalable method for estimating problem difficulty in synthetic data generation, addressing limitations of current approaches by being model-agnostic and independent of ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating problem difficulty (e.g., human calibration or performance-based scoring) are not scalable or generalizable to out-of-distribution problems, creating a need for a more robust solution.

Method: Proposes 'LLM compare,' where an LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and Bradley-Terry scores are computed. The method is validated through a conceptual framework and empirical alignment with human annotations.

Result: LLM compare shows strong alignment with human annotations (Pearson r ≥ 0.80 for n=1876) and robustness to hallucinations (less than 6% degradation in correlation for 10% noise injection).

Conclusion: LLM compare is a scalable and robust method for estimating problem difficulty, potentially replacing human annotations and aiding in curriculum design, model evaluation, and AI-assisted research.

Abstract: Recent advances in the finetuning of large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance on established benchmarks, emphasizing the need for increasingly difficult, synthetic data. A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\%$ noise injection. Our work represents a significant step towards replacing time-consuming human annotations and synthetic data generation, and will be an important driver for curriculum design, model evaluation, and AI-assisted research ideation.

*Divyansh Pareek,Sewoong Oh,Simon S. Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the benefits of teacher-based filtering in contrastive learning, showing improved error bounds compared to unfiltered data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why teacher-based filtering works empirically and to quantify its benefits for multimodal representation learning.

Method: The study uses a linear contrastive learning setup under a standard bimodal data generation model, analyzing error bounds with and without filtering.

Result: Results show that teacher-based filtering improves error bounds: $(i)$ unfiltered error scales as $\frac{1}{η\sqrt{n}}$, while $(ii)$ filtered error scales better ($\frac{1}{\sqrt{ηn}}$ for large $η$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ for small $η$).

Conclusion: Teacher-based filtering provably enhances performance in contrastive learning, especially in regimes with varying data quality.

Abstract: The success of modern multimodal representation learning relies on internet-scale datasets. Due to the low quality of a large fraction of raw web data, data curation has become a critical step in the training pipeline. Filtering using a trained model (i.e., teacher-based filtering) has emerged as a successful solution, leveraging a pre-trained model to compute quality scores. To explain the empirical success of teacher-based filtering, we characterize the performance of filtered contrastive learning under the standard bimodal data generation model. Denoting $η\in(0,1]$ as the fraction of data with correctly matched modalities among $n$ paired samples, we utilize a linear contrastive learning setup to show a provable benefit of data filtering: $(i)$ the error without filtering is upper and lower bounded by $\frac{1}{η\sqrt{n}}$, and $(ii)$ the error with teacher-based filtering is upper bounded by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{ηn}}$ in the large $η$ regime, and by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ in the small $η$ regime.

*Erion Morina,Martin Holler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for learning physically consistent reaction-diffusion systems by enforcing properties like mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring well-posedness and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop interpretable and reliable data-driven models for reaction-diffusion systems that adhere to fundamental physical principles like mass conservation and quasipositivity.

Method: Proposes techniques to modify parameterized reaction terms to inherently satisfy physical properties, extending regularization-based learning to ensure well-posedness and convergence.

Result: Demonstrates convergence to a unique solution and provides approximation results for quasipositive functions, ensuring physical consistency.

Conclusion: The approach advances interpretable and reliable data-driven modeling of reaction-diffusion systems by integrating physical constraints into the learning process.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning reaction-diffusion (RD) systems from data while ensuring physical consistency and well-posedness of the learned models. Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RGM, a novel evaluation methodology for Graph Generative Models (GGMs), addressing limitations of MMD. It evaluates GRAN and EDGE, revealing gaps in structural preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GGMs are promising for synthetic graph generation but face evaluation challenges, particularly with MMD as a metric. The paper aims to improve evaluation methods.

Method: Proposes RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). Evaluates GRAN and EDGE using a Geometric Deep Learning model on a custom dataset.

Result: Both GRAN and EDGE generate graphs with certain topological properties but struggle with structural preservation. MMD is shown to be inadequate.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for better evaluation metrics in GGMs and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Graph generation is a crucial task in many fields, including network science and bioinformatics, as it enables the creation of synthetic graphs that mimic the properties of real-world networks for various applications. Graph Generative Models (GGMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, leveraging deep learning techniques to learn the underlying distribution of real-world graphs and generate new samples that closely resemble them. Examples include approaches based on Variational Auto-Encoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently, diffusion-based models. However, the main limitation often lies in the evaluation process, which typically relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to assess the distribution of graph properties in the generated ensemble. This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating GGMs that overcomes the limitations of MMD, which we call RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE). We investigate their performance in generating realistic graphs and compare them using a Geometric Deep Learning model trained on a custom dataset of synthetic and real-world graphs, specifically designed for graph classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while both models can generate graphs with certain topological properties, they exhibit significant limitations in preserving the structural characteristics that distinguish different graph domains. We also highlight the inadequacy of Maximum Mean Discrepancy as an evaluation metric for GGMs and suggest alternative approaches for future research.

Motivation: To address the need for efficient and robust time series forecasting models that handle both deterministic and probabilistic tasks.

Method: Uses Legendre Memory variants (LegT, LegS) in Encoding/Decoding and a Normalization Flow-based head for generative probabilistic modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on benchmarks TSFM-Bench and ProbTS.

Conclusion: FLAME is a highly efficient and effective solution for time series forecasting tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce FLAME, a family of extremely lightweight and capable Time Series Foundation Models, which support both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting via generative probabilistic modeling, thus ensuring both efficiency and robustness. FLAME utilizes the Legendre Memory for strong generalization capabilities. Through adapting variants of Legendre Memory, i.e., translated Legendre (LegT) and scaled Legendre (LegS), in the Encoding and Decoding phases, FLAME can effectively capture the inherent inductive bias within data and make efficient long-range inferences. To enhance the accuracy of probabilistic forecasting while keeping efficient, FLAME adopts a Normalization Flow based forecasting head, which can model the arbitrarily intricate distributions over the forecasting horizon in a generative manner. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art zero-shot performance of FLAME on both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of GP-based models (interpretability, categorical data handling, computational complexity) to improve real-world usability.

Method: Introduces a decision tree-based surrogate model that handles categorical and continuous data and scales to large datasets.

Result: Outperforms GP-based models on spiky functions with marginally lower performance on non-spiky functions; successfully learns sushi preferences from real-world data.

Conclusion: The decision tree-based model is a viable, interpretable alternative to GPs, with potential for speeding up optimization using historical data.

Abstract: Current Preferential Bayesian Optimization methods rely on Gaussian Processes (GPs) as surrogate models. These models are hard to interpret, struggle with handling categorical data, and are computationally complex, limiting their real-world usability. In this paper, we introduce an inherently interpretable decision tree-based surrogate model capable of handling both categorical and continuous data, and scalable to large datasets. Extensive numerical experiments on eight increasingly spiky optimization functions show that our model outperforms GP-based alternatives on spiky functions and has only marginally lower performance for non-spiky functions. Moreover, we apply our model to the real-world Sushi dataset and show its ability to learn an individual's sushi preferences. Finally, we show some initial work on using historical preference data to speed up the optimization process for new unseen users.

TL;DR: Hopfield networks can infer graph isomorphism classes from small samples due to implicit biases toward norm efficiency and invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores how invariance emerges implicitly in neural networks when trained on group-structured data, focusing on Hopfield networks and their ability to classify graph isomorphism.

Method: Hopfield networks are analyzed using gradient descent to minimize energy flow (MEF), revealing implicit biases toward norm-efficient solutions.

Result: Graph isomorphism classes can be represented in a 3D invariant subspace, and learning rules converge toward invariant solutions with increasing sample sizes.

Conclusion: The findings show that norm efficiency drives approximate invariance in Hopfield networks, unifying generalization mechanisms in such systems.

Abstract: Many learning problems involve symmetries, and while invariance can be built into neural architectures, it can also emerge implicitly when training on group-structured data. We study this phenomenon in classical Hopfield networks and show they can infer the full isomorphism class of a graph from a small random sample. Our results reveal that: (i) graph isomorphism classes can be represented within a three-dimensional invariant subspace, (ii) using gradient descent to minimize energy flow (MEF) has an implicit bias toward norm-efficient solutions, which underpins a polynomial sample complexity bound for learning isomorphism classes, and (iii) across multiple learning rules, parameters converge toward the invariant subspace as sample sizes grow. Together, these findings highlight a unifying mechanism for generalization in Hopfield networks: a bias toward norm efficiency in learning drives the emergence of approximate invariance under group-structured data.

TL;DR: CaDyT is a novel method for causal discovery in dynamical systems, addressing limitations of existing approaches by modeling continuous-time dynamics with Gaussian Process inference and Difference-based causal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for learning system dynamics either discretize time (poor for irregular data) or ignore causality. CaDyT aims to overcome these issues.

Method: CaDyT uses Difference-based causal models and Gaussian Process inference for continuous-time dynamics, with causal structure identified via greedy search guided by Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length.

Result: Experiments show CaDyT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data, uncovering causal networks closer to true dynamics.

Conclusion: CaDyT offers a robust approach for causal discovery in continuous-time dynamical systems, aligning better with real-world processes.

Abstract: Real world systems evolve in continuous-time according to their underlying causal relationships, yet their dynamics are often unknown. Existing approaches to learning such dynamics typically either discretize time -- leading to poor performance on irregularly sampled data -- or ignore the underlying causality. We propose CaDyT, a novel method for causal discovery on dynamical systems addressing both these challenges. In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process. We propose a practical instantiation that identifies the causal structure via a greedy search guided by the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle. Our experiments show that CaDyT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data, discovering causal networks closer to the true underlying dynamics.

Motivation: Privacy vulnerabilities arise in QML models trained on sensitive data, risking memorization of individual records, yet existing QDP mechanisms lack empirical verification tools.

Method: The authors propose a framework based on Lifted Quantum Differential Privacy, utilizing quantum canaries (offset-encoded quantum states) to detect memorization and quantify privacy leakage during training.

Result: The framework establishes a mathematical link between canary offset and trace distance bounds, providing empirical lower bounds on privacy budget consumption, verified across simulated and physical quantum hardware.

Conclusion: The framework effectively measures privacy loss in QML models, enabling robust privacy verification and bridging the gap between theoretical QDP guarantees and practical deployment.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) promises significant computational advantages, yet models trained on sensitive data risk memorizing individual records, creating serious privacy vulnerabilities. While Quantum Differential Privacy (QDP) mechanisms provide theoretical worst-case guarantees, they critically lack empirical verification tools for deployed models. We introduce the first black-box privacy auditing framework for QML based on Lifted Quantum Differential Privacy, leveraging quantum canaries (strategically offset-encoded quantum states) to detect memorization and precisely quantify privacy leakage during training. Our framework establishes a rigorous mathematical connection between canary offset and trace distance bounds, deriving empirical lower bounds on privacy budget consumption that bridge the critical gap between theoretical guarantees and practical privacy verification. Comprehensive evaluations across both simulated and physical quantum hardware demonstrate our framework's effectiveness in measuring actual privacy loss in QML models, enabling robust privacy verification in QML systems.

Motivation: The lack of diverse datasets limits the generalization of machine-learning models in aerodynamic design. SuperWing addresses this gap.

Method: A dataset of 4,239 wing geometries and 28,856 flow solutions is created using expressive parameterization and simulated under various conditions.

Result: Benchmarked Transformers achieve 2.5 drag-count error and show zero-shot generalization to complex wings like DLR-F6 and NASA CRM.

Conclusion: SuperWing's diversity and utility are validated, highlighting its potential for advancing aerodynamic design with machine learning.

Abstract: Machine-learning surrogate models have shown promise in accelerating aerodynamic design, yet progress toward generalizable predictors for three-dimensional wings has been limited by the scarcity and restricted diversity of existing datasets. Here, we present SuperWing, a comprehensive open dataset of transonic swept-wing aerodynamics comprising 4,239 parameterized wing geometries and 28,856 Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes flow field solutions. The wing shapes in the dataset are generated using a simplified yet expressive geometry parameterization that incorporates spanwise variations in airfoil shape, twist, and dihedral, allowing for an enhanced diversity without relying on perturbations of a baseline wing. All shapes are simulated under a broad range of Mach numbers and angles of attack covering the typical flight envelope. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we benchmark two state-of-the-art Transformers that accurately predict surface flow and achieve a 2.5 drag-count error on held-out samples. Models pretrained on SuperWing further exhibit strong zero-shot generalization to complex benchmark wings such as DLR-F6 and NASA CRM, underscoring the dataset's diversity and potential for practical usage.

TL;DR: GRAFT improves grid-aware forecasting by integrating multi-source textual data and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electric load forecasting is complex due to multiple influencing factors like weather, policies, and events. GRAFT aims to better integrate textual data for improved accuracy.

Method: GRAFT aligns daily-aggregated text sources (news, social media, policies) with half-hour load data using cross-attention. It includes a plug-and-play external-memory interface for diverse data sources.

Result: GRAFT outperforms baselines and matches/surpasses state-of-the-art across regions and horizons. It also enables interpretation of text-to-load effects.

Conclusion: GRAFT enhances load forecasting robustness and interpretability, supported by a released benchmark for reproducibility.

Abstract: Electric load is simultaneously affected across multiple time scales by exogenous factors such as weather and calendar rhythms, sudden events, and policies. Therefore, this paper proposes GRAFT (GRid-Aware Forecasting with Text), which modifies and improves STanHOP to better support grid-aware forecasting and multi-source textual interventions. Specifically, GRAFT strictly aligns daily-aggregated news, social media, and policy texts with half-hour load, and realizes text-guided fusion to specific time positions via cross-attention during both training and rolling forecasting. In addition, GRAFT provides a plug-and-play external-memory interface to accommodate different information sources in real-world deployment. We construct and release a unified aligned benchmark covering 2019--2021 for five Australian states (half-hour load, daily-aligned weather/calendar variables, and three categories of external texts), and conduct systematic, reproducible evaluations at three scales -- hourly, daily, and monthly -- under a unified protocol for comparison across regions, external sources, and time scales. Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons. Moreover, the model is robust in event-driven scenarios and enables temporal localization and source-level interpretation of text-to-load effects through attention read-out. We release the benchmark, preprocessing scripts, and forecasting results to facilitate standardized empirical evaluation and reproducibility in power grid load forecasting.

Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving convergent learning across vast chemical space (10^30-10^60) in molecular and materials modeling.

Method: Develops a Dual-Axis RCCL strategy combining GCN encoding of local valence environments and NBG encoding of ring/cage topologies. Creates the FD25 dataset covering 13,302 local valence units and 165,726 ring/cage topologies.

Result: Graph neural networks trained on FD25 achieve representation-complete convergent learning and strong generalization (~1.0 kcal/mol MAE error).

Conclusion: The study links molecular representation, structural completeness, and model generalization, advancing interpretable and transferable molecular intelligence.

Abstract: Machine learning is profoundly reshaping molecular and materials modeling; however, given the vast scale of chemical space (10^30-10^60), it remains an open scientific question whether models can achieve convergent learning across this space. We introduce a Dual-Axis Representation-Complete Convergent Learning (RCCL) strategy, enabled by a molecular representation that integrates graph convolutional network (GCN) encoding of local valence environments, grounded in modern valence bond theory, together with no-bridge graph (NBG) encoding of ring/cage topologies, providing a quantitative measure of chemical-space coverage. This framework formalizes representation completeness, establishing a principled basis for constructing datasets that support convergent learning for large models. Guided by this RCCL framework, we develop the FD25 dataset, systematically covering 13,302 local valence units and 165,726 ring/cage topologies, achieving near-complete combinatorial coverage of organic molecules with H/C/N/O/F elements. Graph neural networks trained on FD25 exhibit representation-complete convergent learning and strong out-of-distribution generalization, with an overall prediction error of approximately 1.0 kcal/mol MAE across external benchmarks. Our results establish a quantitative link between molecular representation, structural completeness, and model generalization, providing a foundation for interpretable, transferable, and data-efficient molecular intelligence.

Motivation: To advance ML-based weather prediction by integrating real observations and ensemble forecasts, addressing gaps in current MLWP research.

Method: Developed ClimaX-LETKF, a data-driven ML ensemble system, using NCEP ADP observations and comparing RTPP and RTPS techniques.

Result: ClimaX-LETKF operates stably for years, with RTPP outperforming RTPS in stability and accuracy, though MLWP models struggle restoring atmospheric fields compared to NWP.

Conclusion: This study marks progress in MLWP ensemble systems, offering insights for practical applications despite MLWP's current limitations.

Abstract: While machine learning-based weather prediction (MLWP) has achieved significant advancements, research on assimilating real observations or ensemble forecasts within MLWP models remains limited. We introduce ClimaX-LETKF, the first purely data-driven ML-based ensemble weather forecasting system. It operates stably over multiple years, independently of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, by assimilating the NCEP ADP Global Upper Air and Surface Weather Observations. The system demonstrates greater stability and accuracy with relaxation to prior perturbation (RTPP) than with relaxation to prior spread (RTPS), while NWP models tend to be more stable with RTPS. RTPP replaces an analysis perturbation with a weighted blend of analysis and background perturbations, whereas RTPS simply rescales the analysis perturbation. Our experiments reveal that MLWP models are less capable of restoring the atmospheric field to its attractor than NWP models. This work provides valuable insights for enhancing MLWP ensemble forecasting systems and represents a substantial step toward their practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual sleep staging is labor-intensive and lacks standardization across centers, hindering harmonized multi-center studies and biomarker discovery on shorter timescales.

Method: AnySleep uses EEG/EOG data and was trained on over 19,000 recordings (~200,000 hours) from 21 datasets, ensuring robustness across sites and varying electrode setups.

Result: The model matches or exceeds baseline performance at 30-s epochs, improves with more channels, and excels at sub-30-s scales for detecting wake intrusions and predicting age, sex, and sleep apnea.

Conclusion: AnySleep facilitates large-scale sleep studies with heterogeneous setups and accelerates biomarker discovery, offering a versatile, high-performance solution for automated sleep staging.

Abstract: Sleep is essential for good health throughout our lives, yet studying its dynamics requires manual sleep staging, a labor-intensive step in sleep research and clinical care. Across centers, polysomnography (PSG) recordings are traditionally scored in 30-s epochs for pragmatic, not physiological, reasons and can vary considerably in electrode count, montage, and subject characteristics. These constraints present challenges in conducting harmonized multi-center sleep studies and discovering novel, robust biomarkers on shorter timescales. Here, we present AnySleep, a deep neural network model that uses any electroencephalography (EEG) or electrooculography (EOG) data to score sleep at adjustable temporal resolutions. We trained and validated the model on over 19,000 overnight recordings from 21 datasets collected across multiple clinics, spanning nearly 200,000 hours of EEG and EOG data, to promote robust generalization across sites. The model attains state-of-the-art performance and surpasses or equals established baselines at 30-s epochs. Performance improves as more channels are provided, yet remains strong when EOG is absent or when only EOG or single EEG derivations (frontal, central, or occipital) are available. On sub-30-s timescales, the model captures short wake intrusions consistent with arousals and improves prediction of physiological characteristics (age, sex) and pathophysiological conditions (sleep apnea), relative to standard 30-s scoring.

*Additi Pandey,Liang Wei,Hessam Babaee,George Em Karniadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kinetic-Mamba is a Mamba-based neural operator framework for accurate chemical kinetics modeling in combustion simulations, integrating neural operators with Mamba architectures. It includes three models for predicting thermochemical state evolution, ensuring mass conservation, and handling temperature-dependent regimes. Evaluations show high fidelity in predicting complex kinetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate chemical kinetics modeling is crucial for combustion simulations to understand reaction pathways and thermochemical states. Kinetic-Mamba addresses this by combining neural operators' expressive power with Mamba's efficient temporal modeling.

Method: The framework includes three models: (i) standalone Mamba for state evolution, (ii) constrained Mamba enforcing mass conservation, and (iii) regime-informed Mamba for temperature-dependent dynamics. A latent variant operates in reduced space. Evaluations use time-decomposition, recursive-prediction, and extrapolation tests.

Result: Kinetic-Mamba achieves high accuracy in predicting complex kinetic behavior from initial conditions, validated on Syngas and GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanisms.

Conclusion: Kinetic-Mamba effectively integrates neural operators with Mamba architectures for robust chemical kinetics modeling, demonstrating strong performance in combustion simulations.

Abstract: Accurate chemical kinetics modeling is essential for combustion simulations, as it governs the evolution of complex reaction pathways and thermochemical states. In this work, we introduce Kinetic-Mamba, a Mamba-based neural operator framework that integrates the expressive power of neural operators with the efficient temporal modeling capabilities of Mamba architectures. The framework comprises three complementary models: (i) a standalone Mamba model that predicts the time evolution of thermochemical state variables from given initial conditions; (ii) a constrained Mamba model that enforces mass conservation while learning the state dynamics; and (iii) a regime-informed architecture employing two standalone Mamba models to capture dynamics across temperature-dependent regimes. We additionally develop a latent Kinetic-Mamba variant that evolves dynamics in a reduced latent space and reconstructs the full state on the physical manifold. We evaluate the accuracy and robustness of Kinetic-Mamba using both time-decomposition and recursive-prediction strategies. We further assess the extrapolation capabilities of the model on varied out-of-distribution datasets. Computational experiments on Syngas and GRI-Mech 3.0 reaction mechanisms demonstrate that our framework achieves high fidelity in predicting complex kinetic behavior using only the initial conditions of the state variables.

*Jacob Taegon Kim,Alex Sim,Kesheng Wu,Jinoh Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing ML model accuracy for data transfer performance prediction by addressing class imbalance through various augmentation strategies, finding minimal improvement with advanced techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the predictive power of ML models for monitoring data transfer performance in scientific computing networks by tackling the class imbalance problem.

Method: Analysis and comparison of augmentation strategies (oversampling and generative techniques) and adjustment of class imbalance ratios in training datasets.

Result: Augmentation shows limited improvement; advanced techniques like CTGAN do not outperform simple stratified sampling as imbalance ratios increase.

Conclusion: Even sophisticated augmentation methods do not significantly enhance performance over basic stratified sampling in addressing class imbalance for this context.

Abstract: Monitoring data transfer performance is a crucial task in scientific computing networks. By predicting performance early in the communication phase, potentially sluggish transfers can be identified and selectively monitored, optimizing network usage and overall performance. A key bottleneck to improving the predictive power of machine learning (ML) models in this context is the issue of class imbalance. This project focuses on addressing the class imbalance problem to enhance the accuracy of performance predictions. In this study, we analyze and compare various augmentation strategies, including traditional oversampling methods and generative techniques. Additionally, we adjust the class imbalance ratios in training datasets to evaluate their impact on model performance. While augmentation may improve performance, as the imbalance ratio increases, the performance does not significantly improve. We conclude that even the most advanced technique, such as CTGAN, does not significantly improve over simple stratified sampling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using VAEs to generate synthetic atrial EGMs to address limited BSPM-EGM data, showing potential to improve ECGI pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scarcity of paired BSPM-EGM datasets for accurate atrial fibrillation assessment.

Method: Proposes two VAE models (VAE-S and VAE-C) for generating synthetic atrial EGMs, evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional metrics.

Result: VAE-S offers higher fidelity, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation. Data augmentation with synthetic EGMs improves downstream EGM reconstruction.

Conclusion: VAE-based generative modeling can alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI approaches.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and its clinical assessment requires accurate characterization of atrial electrical activity. Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines.

*Emmanuel C. Chukwu,Rianne M. Schouten,Monique Tabak,Mykola Pechenizkiy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques current counterfactual explanation methods for time series classification, arguing they fail in clinical settings due to lack of temporal coherence and causal plausibility. It calls for more actionable, user-centered approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current counterfactual techniques for time series classification are insufficient for clinical recommendations, as they ignore temporal coherence, causal plausibility, and user-centered considerations.

Method: The paper analyzes robustness of state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating their sensitivity to stochastic noise, and identifies gaps like temporal blind spots and lack of user-centered design.

Result: Generated counterfactuals are unreliable in clinical settings due to high sensitivity to minor noise, highlighting limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for counterfactuals that reflect sustained, feasible, and actionable interventions, aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are increasingly proposed as interpretable mechanisms to achieve algorithmic recourse. However, current counterfactual techniques for time series classification are predominantly designed with static data assumptions and focus on generating minimal input perturbations to flip model predictions. This paper argues that such approaches are fundamentally insufficient in clinical recommendation settings, where interventions unfold over time and must be causally plausible and temporally coherent. We advocate for a shift towards counterfactuals that reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics. We identify critical gaps in existing methods that limit their practical applicability, specifically, temporal blind spots and the lack of user-centered considerations in both method design and evaluation metrics. To support our position, we conduct a robustness analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for time series and show that the generated counterfactuals are highly sensitive to stochastic noise. This finding highlights their limited reliability in real-world clinical settings, where minor measurement variations are inevitable. We conclude by calling for methods and evaluation frameworks that go beyond mere prediction changes without considering feasibility or actionability. We emphasize the need for actionable, purpose-driven interventions that are feasible in real-world contexts for the users of such applications.

TL;DR: Proposes Residual GRU with Multi-Head Self-Attention for CVD prediction, outperforming traditional and deep learning methods with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need reliable predictive tools for CVD due to its high mortality and limitations of traditional and existing ML methods.

Method: Combines residual bidirectional GRUs, channel reweighting, and multi-head self-attention for tabular clinical data.

Result: Achieves superior performance (accuracy 0.861, ROC-AUC 0.908) vs. baselines, with clear class separation in embeddings.

Conclusion: Lightweight hybrid architectures balance accuracy and efficiency, suitable for resource-constrained healthcare.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for reliable and efficient predictive tools that support early intervention. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on handcrafted features and clinician expertise, while machine learning methods improve reproducibility but often struggle to generalize across noisy and heterogeneous clinical data. In this work, we propose Residual GRU with Multi-Head Self-Attention, a compact deep learning architecture designed for tabular clinical records. The model integrates residual bidirectional gated recurrent units for sequential modeling of feature columns, a channel reweighting block, and multi-head self-attention pooling with a learnable classification token to capture global context. We evaluate the model on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 5-fold stratified cross-validation and compare it against classical methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, as well as modern deep learning baselines including DeepMLP, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and Transformers. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.861, macro-F1 of 0.860, ROC-AUC of 0.908, and PR-AUC of 0.904, outperforming all baselines. Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of residual recurrence, channel gating, and attention pooling. t-SNE visualizations further indicate that the learned embeddings exhibit clearer separation between disease and non-disease classes compared to raw features. These results demonstrate that lightweight hybrid recurrent and attention-based architectures provide a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency for clinical risk prediction, supporting deployment in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

TL;DR: A new geometry-aware deep operator network (Geo-DeepONet) improves hybrid iterative solvers for parametric PDEs by incorporating domain information, enhancing performance across unstructured meshes without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid solvers struggle with geometries not seen during training, limiting their applicability.

Method: Geo-DeepONet integrates domain data from finite element discretizations and combines with traditional iterative methods for robust PDE solutions.

Result: Numerical experiments show improved robustness and efficiency for parametric PDEs on unstructured domains.

Conclusion: Geo-DeepONet offers a scalable solution for geometry-aware hybrid solvers in diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: The convergence behavior of classical iterative solvers for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is often highly sensitive to the domain and specific discretization of PDEs. Previously, we introduced hybrid solvers by combining the classical solvers with neural operators for a specific geometry 1, but they tend to under-perform in geometries not encountered during training. To address this challenge, we introduce Geo-DeepONet, a geometry-aware deep operator network that incorporates domain information extracted from finite element discretizations. Geo-DeepONet enables accurate operator learning across arbitrary unstructured meshes without requiring retraining. Building on this, we develop a class of geometry-aware hybrid preconditioned iterative solvers by coupling Geo-DeepONet with traditional methods such as relaxation schemes and Krylov subspace algorithms. Through numerical experiments on parametric PDEs posed over diverse unstructured domains, we demonstrate the enhanced robustness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid solvers for multiple real-world applications.

TL;DR: OW-HNPV is a velocity-based topological method for anomaly detection in time-varying networks, proving mathematically stable and outperforming baselines in Ethereum transaction analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on cumulative topological presence, lacking a velocity-based perspective to measure feature dynamics and noise resilience.

Method: Introduces OW-HNPV, a velocity-based approach weighting persistence diagrams by overlap to downweight noise, with proven mathematical stability.

Result: OW-HNPV outperforms baselines (e.g., VAB, persistence landscapes) in Ethereum anomaly detection, achieving up to 10.4% AUC gain for 7-day forecasts.

Conclusion: Velocity-based topological modeling is essential for detecting structural anomalies in dynamic networks, with OW-HNPV offering superior stability and performance.

Abstract: We introduce the Overlap-Weighted Hierarchical Normalized Persistence Velocity (OW-HNPV), a novel topological data analysis method for detecting anomalies in time-varying networks. Unlike existing methods that measure cumulative topological presence, we introduce the first velocity-based perspective on persistence diagrams, measuring the rate at which features appear and disappear, automatically downweighting noise through overlap-based weighting. We also prove that OW-HNPV is mathematically stable. It behaves in a controlled, predictable way, even when comparing persistence diagrams from networks with different feature types. Applied to Ethereum transaction networks (May 2017-May 2018), OW-HNPV demonstrates superior performance for cryptocurrency anomaly detection, achieving up to 10.4% AUC gain over baseline models for 7-day price movement predictions. Compared with established methods, including Vector of Averaged Bettis (VAB), persistence landscapes, and persistence images, velocity-based summaries excel at medium- to long-range forecasting (4-7 days), with OW-HNPV providing the most consistent and stable performance across prediction horizons. Our results show that modeling topological velocity is crucial for detecting structural anomalies in dynamic networks.

*Alessandro Trapasso,Luca Iocchi,Fabio Patrizi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QR-MAX is a novel model-based RL algorithm for NMRDPs, addressing optimality and sample efficiency issues by factorizing Markovian transitions and non-Markovian rewards. It achieves PAC convergence and extends to continuous states with Bucket-QR-MAX, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Markovian RL fails for tasks relying on system history. NMRDPs solve this but lack guarantees on optimality and sample efficiency. QR-MAX aims to bridge this gap.

Method: QR-MAX uses reward machines to factorize Markovian transitions and non-Markovian rewards. Bucket-QR-MAX extends this to continuous states using SimHash for discretization.

Result: The algorithm achieves PAC convergence with polynomial sample complexity and outperforms modern RL methods in sample efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: QR-MAX provides a scalable and efficient solution for NMRDPs, advancing RL for history-dependent tasks.

Abstract: Many practical decision-making problems involve tasks whose success depends on the entire system history, rather than on achieving a state with desired properties. Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes (NMRDPs) enables agents to tackle temporal-dependency tasks. This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency. We contribute to solving both issues with QR-MAX, a novel model-based algorithm for discrete NMRDPs that factorizes Markovian transition learning from non-Markovian reward handling via reward machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm for discrete-action NMRDPs that exploits this factorization to obtain PAC convergence to $\varepsilon$-optimal policies with polynomial sample complexity. We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation. We experimentally compare our method with modern state-of-the-art model-based RL approaches on environments of increasing complexity, showing a significant improvement in sample efficiency and increased robustness in finding optimal policies.

TL;DR: ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing in Graph Transformers by using PageRank-enhanced attention, improving performance on node and graph classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the severe over-smoothing issue in Graph Transformers caused by global attention.

Method: Introduce PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer) with a PageRank-enhanced attention module to mimic deep Transformers.

Result: ParaFormer acts as an adaptive-pass filter, reducing over-smoothing and improving performance across 11 datasets.

Conclusion: ParaFormer effectively mitigates over-smoothing and enhances performance in graph learning tasks.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising graph learning tool, leveraging their all-pair connected property to effectively capture global information. To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter. Experiments show that ParaFormer achieves consistent performance improvements across both node classification and graph classification tasks on 11 datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes, validating its efficacy. The supplementary material, including code and appendix, can be found in https://github.com/chaohaoyuan/ParaFormer.

Conclusion: The library is available on GitHub and via pip, providing a scalable and versatile solution for generating realistic PF and OPF datasets for ML training.

Abstract: We introduce gridfm-datakit-v1, a Python library for generating realistic and diverse Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) datasets for training Machine Learning (ML) solvers. Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$Δ$ are provided.

TL;DR: The paper explores non-smooth activation functions in reservoir computing, showing they outperform traditional smooth functions in stability and convergence. Key findings include the Cantor function's superior performance and a new theoretical framework for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of smooth activation functions in critical applications like defense and disaster response by investigating non-smooth alternatives.

Method: Systematic parameter sweeps across 36,610 reservoir configurations using non-smooth functions, including chaotic and fractal variants.

Result: Non-smooth functions maintain stability (ESP) and outperform smooth ones, with the Cantor function achieving 2.6x faster convergence and higher spectral radius tolerance.

Conclusion: Preprocessing topology, not continuity, determines stability, but gaps remain in understanding fractal functions' exceptional performance.

Abstract: Contemporary reservoir computing relies heavily on smooth, globally Lipschitz continuous activation functions, limiting applications in defense, disaster response, and pharmaceutical modeling where robust operation under extreme conditions is critical. We systematically investigate non-smooth activation functions, including chaotic, stochastic, and fractal variants, in echo state networks. Through comprehensive parameter sweeps across 36,610 reservoir configurations, we demonstrate that several non-smooth functions not only maintain the Echo State Property (ESP) but outperform traditional smooth activations in convergence speed and spectral radius tolerance. Notably, the Cantor function (continuous everywhere and flat almost everywhere) maintains ESP-consistent behavior up to spectral radii of rho ~ 10, an order of magnitude beyond typical bounds for smooth functions, while achieving 2.6x faster convergence than tanh and ReLU. We introduce a theoretical framework for quantized activation functions, defining a Degenerate Echo State Property (d-ESP) that captures stability for discrete-output functions and proving that d-ESP implies traditional ESP. We identify a critical crowding ratio Q=N/k (reservoir size / quantization levels) that predicts failure thresholds for discrete activations. Our analysis reveals that preprocessing topology, rather than continuity per se, determines stability: monotone, compressive preprocessing maintains ESP across scales, while dispersive or discontinuous preprocessing triggers sharp failures. While our findings challenge assumptions about activation function design in reservoir computing, the mechanism underlying the exceptional performance of certain fractal functions remains unexplained, suggesting fundamental gaps in our understanding of how geometric properties of activation functions influence reservoir dynamics.

TL;DR: A multimodal machine learning framework called Early Warning Index (EWI) is developed to predict ICU admission, emergency response dispatch, and mortality risks using heterogeneous clinical data, achieving a C-statistic of 0.796.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hospitals lack automated systems to utilize diverse clinical data effectively for forecasting critical events, which is crucial for patient care quality and physician management.

Method: EWI integrates structured and unstructured EHR data, employs a human-in-the-loop process with clinician input, and uses SHAP for explainable outputs to highlight risk factors.

Result: EWI achieves a C-statistic of 0.796 and is deployed in a hospital dashboard for triaging patients into three risk tiers, aiding proactive patient management.

Conclusion: EWI saves physician time, improves resource allocation, and helps avert complications, enhancing overall patient flow and care quality.

Abstract: Hospitals lack automated systems to harness the growing volume of heterogeneous clinical and operational data to effectively forecast critical events. Early identification of patients at risk for deterioration is essential not only for patient care quality monitoring but also for physician care management. However, translating varied data streams into accurate and interpretable risk assessments poses significant challenges due to inconsistent data formats. We develop a multimodal machine learning framework, the Early Warning Index (EWI), to predict the aggregate risk of ICU admission, emergency response team dispatch, and mortality. Key to EWI's design is a human-in-the-loop process: clinicians help determine alert thresholds and interpret model outputs, which are enhanced by explainable outputs using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to highlight clinical and operational factors (e.g., scheduled surgeries, ward census) driving each patient's risk. We deploy EWI in a hospital dashboard that stratifies patients into three risk tiers. Using a dataset of 18,633 unique patients at a large U.S. hospital, our approach automatically extracts features from both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data and achieves C-statistics of 0.796. It is currently used as a triage tool for proactively managing at-risk patients. The proposed approach saves physicians valuable time by automatically sorting patients of varying risk levels, allowing them to concentrate on patient care rather than sifting through complex EHR data. By further pinpointing specific risk drivers, the proposed model provides data-informed adjustments to caregiver scheduling and allocation of critical resources. As a result, clinicians and administrators can avert downstream complications, including costly procedures or high readmission rates and improve overall patient flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing complexity and inefficiency in cloud-native IT operations due to overwhelming data.

Method: AOI uses dynamic task scheduling and a three-layer memory architecture for context retention.

Result: Achieves 72.4% context compression, 92.8% critical info retention, 94.2% task success, and 34.4% MTTR reduction.

Conclusion: AOI enables scalable, adaptive, and autonomous IT operations with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: The proliferation of cloud-native architectures, characterized by microservices and dynamic orchestration, has rendered modern IT infrastructures exceedingly complex and volatile. This complexity generates overwhelming volumes of operational data, leading to critical bottlenecks in conventional systems: inefficient information processing, poor task coordination, and loss of contextual continuity during fault diagnosis and remediation. To address these challenges, we propose AOI (AI-Oriented Operations), a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that integrates three specialized agents with an LLM-based Context Compressor. Its core innovations include: (1) a dynamic task scheduling strategy that adaptively prioritizes operations based on real-time system states, and (2) a three-layer memory architecture comprising Working, Episodic, and Semantic layers that optimizes context retention and retrieval. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that AOI effectively mitigates information overload, achieving a 72.4% context compression ratio while preserving 92.8% of critical information and significantly enhances operational efficiency, attaining a 94.2% task success rate and reducing the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) by 34.4% compared to the best baseline. This work presents a paradigm shift towards scalable, adaptive, and context-aware autonomous operations, enabling robust management of next-generation IT infrastructures with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Multidisciplinary team (MDT) consultations are the gold standard for cancer care decision-making, yet current practice lacks structured mechanisms for quantifying consensus and ensuring decision traceability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Medical Decision Consensus Matrix System that deploys seven specialized large language model agents, including an oncologist, a radiologist, a nurse, a psychologist, a patient advocate, a nutritionist and a rehabilitation therapist, to simulate realistic MDT workflows. The framework incorporates a mathematically grounded consensus matrix that uses Kendall's coefficient of concordance to objectively assess agreement. To further enhance treatment recommendation quality and consensus efficiency, the system integrates reinforcement learning methods, including Q-Learning, PPO and DQN. Evaluation across five medical benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets and SymCat) shows substantial gains over existing approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 87.5% compared with 83.8% for the strongest baseline, a consensus achievement rate of 89.3% and a mean Kendall's W of 0.823. Expert reviewers rated the clinical appropriateness of system outputs at 8.9/10. The system guarantees full evidence traceability through mandatory citations of clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed literature, following GRADE principles. This work advances medical AI by providing structured consensus measurement, role-specialized multi-agent collaboration and evidence-based explainability to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs' coordination abilities in distributed systems, particularly in symmetry-breaking scenarios.

Method: LoopBench tests LLMs on coloring odd cycle graphs with limited colors, using strategy passing as memory.

Result: Advanced reasoning models (e.g., O3) succeed in escaping deadlocks, unlike standard LLMs or classical heuristics.

Conclusion: LoopBench provides a framework to study emergent distributed algorithms and collective intelligence in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being utilized as autonomous agents, yet their ability to coordinate in distributed systems remains poorly understood. We introduce \textbf{LoopBench}, a benchmark to evaluate LLM reasoning in distributed symmetry breaking and meta-cognitive thinking. The benchmark focuses on coloring odd cycle graphs ($C_3, C_5, C_{11}$) with limited colors, where deterministic, non-communicating agents fail in infinite loops. A strategy passing mechanism is implemented as a form of consistent memory. We show that while standard LLMs and classical heuristics struggle, advanced reasoning models (e.g., O3) devise strategies to escape deadlocks.

### [214] [EvoLattice: Persistent Internal-Population Evolution through Multi-Alternative Quality-Diversity Graph Representations for LLM-Guided Program Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13857)
*Kamer Ali Yuksel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoLattice introduces a framework using directed acyclic graphs to evolve programs and agent behaviors, preserving multiple alternatives for richer exploration and better performance compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches discard useful variants and suffer from destructive edits, limiting their effectiveness in program and agent evolution.

Method: EvoLattice represents candidate populations as directed acyclic graphs with persistent alternatives, enabling fine-grained evaluation and LLM-guided mutation while ensuring structural correctness.

Result: The framework improves stability, expressivity, and performance trajectories in program synthesis and agent evolution, resembling quality-diversity optimization.

Conclusion: EvoLattice offers a robust, data-driven approach for evolving programs and agents, outperforming prior methods by preserving successful components and enabling richer search spaces.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evolve programs and multi-agent systems, yet most existing approaches rely on overwrite-based mutations that maintain only a single candidate at a time. Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.

TL;DR: A modular framework using LLMs automates feature extraction from clinical notes, reducing manual chart review burden and improving data consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual chart review is time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring expert extraction from unstructured EHR narratives.

Method: Uses locally deployed LLMs with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and structured response methods on HIPAA-compliant infrastructure.

Result: Achieved high accuracy in extracting medical features, identified manual review errors, and showed scalability.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LLMs' potential to automate extraction, reduce manual effort, and enhance clinical research efficiency.

Abstract: Manual chart review remains an extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive component of clinical research, requiring experts to extract often complex information from unstructured electronic health record (EHR) narratives. We present a secure, modular framework for automated structured feature extraction from clinical notes leveraging locally deployed large language models (LLMs) on institutionally approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)-compliant compute infrastructure. This system integrates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and structured response methods of LLMs into a widely deployable and scalable container to provide feature extraction for diverse clinical domains. In evaluation, the framework achieved high accuracy across multiple medical characteristics present in large bodies of patient notes when compared against an expert-annotated dataset and identified several annotation errors missed in manual review. This framework demonstrates the potential of LLM systems to reduce the burden of manual chart review through automated extraction and increase consistency in data capture, accelerating clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve upon LLM-based free-form search methods in Multi-Agent Systems by introducing a more structured and composable approach.

Method: The method involves using a fixed set of simple, composable components to explore the search space, contrasting with LLM-based generative flexibility.

Result: The results show superiority over prior methods in four out of five benchmarks across mathematics and question answering domains.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the framework's benefits, including cost-efficiency and the generation of modular, interpretable systems with simpler logic.

Abstract: Automatic search for Multi-Agent Systems has recently emerged as a key focus in agentic AI research. Several prior approaches have relied on LLM-based free-form search over the code space. In this work, we propose a more structured framework that explores the same space through a fixed set of simple, composable components. We show that, despite lacking the generative flexibility of LLMs during the candidate generation stage, our method outperforms prior approaches on four out of five benchmarks across two domains: mathematics and question answering. Furthermore, our method offers additional advantages, including a more cost-efficient search process and the generation of modular, interpretable multi-agent systems with simpler logic.

*Zheng Xing,Junting Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a blind radio map construction framework using MIMO-OFDM channel measurements without location labels, proving CSI spatial continuity and achieving accurate trajectory recovery and beam map reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional radio map methods require costly location-labeled data, prompting the need for a blind approach leveraging CSI and environmental models.

Method: The framework uses a spatially regularized Bayesian inference to estimate channel features, distinguish LOS/NLOS, and recover trajectories, supported by theoretical proofs on CSI-distance metrics.

Result: Experiments show an average localization error of 0.68m and beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The blind mapping method successfully overcomes reliance on labeled data, offering practical solutions for intelligent wireless applications.

Abstract: Radio maps enable intelligent wireless applications by capturing the spatial distribution of channel characteristics. However, conventional construction methods demand extensive location-labeled data, which are costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories. Experiments on a ray-tracing dataset demonstrate an average localization error of 0.68 m and a beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed blind mapping method.

*Doohee You,Sundeep Paul*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adjudicator is a neuro-symbolic system for identifying and correcting label noise in training data, using a dynamic Knowledge Graph and a multi-agent LLM architecture, achieving a 0.99 F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy labels degrade performance and trust in high-stakes machine learning applications, motivating the need for automated, high-precision data verification.

Method: Adjudicator constructs a dynamic Knowledge Graph to unify item context and employs a Council of Agents (multi-agent LLM) to debate and vote on label validity.

Result: The system achieves a 0.99 F1-score, outperforming single-LLM (0.48) and non-KG council (0.59) baselines, with perfect Recall for complex, structural errors.

Conclusion: Adjudicator provides a robust, explainable solution for automated data verification, suitable for generating golden datasets in governed industrial settings.

Abstract: The performance of production machine learning systems is fundamentally limited by the quality of their training data. In high-stakes industrial applications, noisy labels can degrade performance and erode user trust. This paper presents Adjudicator, a system that addresses the critical data mining challenge of automatically identifying and correcting label noise and has been validated for production deployment. Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context. This KG then informs a "Council of Agents," a novel multi-agent Large Language Model architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on a label's validity. We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find. This result demonstrates a robust and explainable system for automated, high-precision data verification, serving as a vital proof-of-concept for generating golden datasets in strictly governed industrial environments.

TL;DR: The paper addresses LLM instability in regulated industries by introducing an AI-based annotation pipeline that combines weak supervision and human validation to improve reliability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face reliability issues like hallucinations and inconsistent reasoning in regulated industries, limiting their safe use. Current stabilization methods like RLHF are costly and hard to scale.

Method: Proposes a human-AI synergy method using automated weak supervision and confidence-based annotation with human validation for reliable feedback. Introduces stability-specific annotation categories (semantic consistency, factual correctness, logical coherence).

Result: The framework enables continuous model calibration and robustness enhancement through feedback loops.

Conclusion: The AI-based annotation pipeline offers a scalable and reliable solution to stabilize LLMs in regulated workflows, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: LLM implementations are failing in highly regulated industries owing to instability issues, inconsistent reasoning, hallucinations and performance variability, especially in workflows. These reliability issues restrict safe use of LLM in areas that need the precision of facts and consistent behavior (Aiyappa et al., 2023). The current methods of stabilization, such as, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and supervised fine-tuning, offer quantifiable improvements but are expensive and based on the intensive annotation of humans, thus being not easily scaled in a sustainable way (Dong et al., 2023; Retzlaff et al., 2024). This paper presents an AI-based annotation pipeline that systematically identifies, labels, and fixes for instability patterns on LLM output. Our human-AI synergy method combines the models of automated weak supervision and confidence-based annotation with the target human validation to guarantee the reliability and moral uprightness of feedback information (Cabitza et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). The semantic consistency, factual correctness, and logical coherence categories of stability-specific annotation are introduced into our framework, allowing the continuous calibration of models and the enhancement of their robustness based on the feedback loops (Honovich et al., 2021; Nan et al., 2021).

*Fatemeh Lotfi,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework for dynamic resource management and network slicing in O-RAN, outperforming baseline methods by 19.8% in efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern applications require adaptable wireless networks with efficient resource management. O-RAN's RIC modules offer dynamic solutions, but current AI-driven methods struggle under unpredictable conditions.

Method: Proposes a Meta-HRL framework inspired by MAML, integrating hierarchical control and meta-learning for global (resource allocation) and local (intra-slice scheduling) adaptation. Includes an adaptive meta-update mechanism weighted by temporal difference error variance.

Result: Simulations show a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency, faster adaptation, and higher QoS satisfaction across slices. Scalability studies confirm robustness with up to 40% faster adaptation.

Conclusion: The Meta-HRL framework effectively addresses dynamic resource management challenges in O-RAN, offering superior performance, adaptability, and scalability compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern applications demands wireless networks capable of real time adaptability and efficient resource management. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases.

TL;DR: ValuePilot, a two-phase framework (DGT and DMM), uses human values for personalized AI decision-making, outperforming LLM baselines in alignment with human choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized decision-making is crucial for human-AI interaction, ensuring AI aligns with individual values beyond task completion.

Method: ValuePilot combines a dataset generation toolkit (DGT) and decision-making module (DMM). DGT creates value-annotated scenarios; DMM evaluates actions based on personal values.

Result: DMM outperforms LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4) in aligning with human action choices in unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: Value-driven decision-making is effective for interpretable, personalized AI agents.

Abstract: Personalized decision-making is essential for human-AI interaction, enabling AI agents to act in alignment with individual users' value preferences. As AI systems expand into real-world applications, adapting to personalized values beyond task completion or collective alignment has become a critical challenge. We address this by proposing a value-driven approach to personalized decision-making. Human values serve as stable, transferable signals that support consistent and generalizable behavior across contexts. Compared to task-oriented paradigms driven by external rewards and incentives, value-driven decision-making enhances interpretability and enables agents to act appropriately even in novel scenarios. We introduce ValuePilot, a two-phase framework consisting of a dataset generation toolkit (DGT) and a decision-making module (DMM). DGT constructs diverse, value-annotated scenarios from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. DMM learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences, enabling context-sensitive, individualized decisions. When evaluated on previously unseen scenarios, DMM outperforms strong LLM baselines, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2-flash, and Llama-3.1-70b, in aligning with human action choices. Our results demonstrate that value-driven decision-making is an effective and extensible engineering pathway toward building interpretable, personalized AI agents.

### [222] [Compressed Causal Reasoning: Quantization and GraphRAG Effects on Interventional and Counterfactual Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13725)
*Steve Nwaiwu,Nipat Jongsawat,Anucha Tungkasthan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of quantization (INT8 and NF4) on causal reasoning in large language models, finding robustness to 4-bit quantization and suggesting graph-structured augmentation can improve interventional accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how precision reduction (quantization) affects formal causal reasoning in large language models, especially for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Systematic evaluation using a 3000-sample stratified CLadder benchmark and experiments on the CRASS benchmark, including Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation with ground truth causal graphs.

Result: Causal reasoning in Llama 3 8B remains stable under quantization, with NF4 showing minimal degradation. Interventional queries are most sensitive, while counterfactual reasoning is robust but exhibits weaknesses. Graph-augmented NF4 improves interventional accuracy.

Conclusion: Causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to 4-bit quantization, graph augmentation can reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks lack sensitivity to reveal quantization-induced brittleness.

Abstract: Causal reasoning in Large Language Models spanning association, intervention, and counterfactual inference is essential for reliable decision making in high stakes settings. As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness. This work provides an initial empirical map of compressed causal reasoning and practical guidance for deploying efficient and structurally supported causal AI systems.

TL;DR: The study introduces a qualitative method to audit behavioral patterns in LLMs, revealing selective withholding (learned incapacity) in sensitive contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover behavioral asymmetries in LLMs not captured by standard benchmarks, focusing on policy-sensitive domains.

Method: A qualitative case-study involving an 86-turn dialogue session, categorizing responses into Normal Performance (NP), Functional Refusal (FR), and Meta-Narrative (MN).

Result: The model exhibited NP broadly but selectively withheld responses (FR) in sensitive domains, with MN narratives co-occurring with refusals.

Conclusion: Learned incapacity (LI) is proposed as a descriptor for this behavior, highlighting the need for further investigation into alignment side effects.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as general-purpose tools, yet extended interaction can reveal behavioral patterns not captured by standard quantitative benchmarks. We present a qualitative case-study methodology for auditing policy-linked behavioral selectivity in long-horizon interaction. In a single 86-turn dialogue session, the same model shows Normal Performance (NP) in broad, non-sensitive domains while repeatedly producing Functional Refusal (FR) in provider- or policy-sensitive domains, yielding a consistent asymmetry between NP and FR across domains. Drawing on learned helplessness as an analogy, we introduce learned incapacity (LI) as a behavioral descriptor for this selective withholding without implying intentionality or internal mechanisms. We operationalize three response regimes (NP, FR, Meta-Narrative; MN) and show that MN role-framing narratives tend to co-occur with refusals in the same sensitive contexts. Overall, the study proposes an interaction-level auditing framework based on observable behavior and motivates LI as a lens for examining potential alignment side effects, warranting further investigation across users and models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how mathematics and coding influence AI agent evaluation, showing their roles in enabling stable self-improvement and universal evaluation coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the unique impact of mathematics and coding tasks in psychometric batteries for AI, particularly their potential to enable self-improvement and serve as universal evaluation metrics.

Method: The authors use the AAI framework and GVU dynamics, defining the Mathematics Fiber and pairing it with formal proof kernels. They analyze spectral stability under oracle-like verification and prove a density theorem.

Result: The research demonstrates that coding alone is universal in evaluation, while pure mathematics is privileged spectrally. Mathematics and coding act as universal coordinates, and formal math is a natural domain for AI self-improvement.

Conclusion: The findings suggest mathematics and coding are foundational for AI evaluation and self-improvement, with formal math serving as a key ignition domain.

Abstract: We study the special role of mathematics and coding inside the moduli space of psychometric batteries for AI agents. Building on the AAI framework and GVU dynamics from previous works, we define the Mathematics Fiber and show that, when paired with formal proof kernels (e.g. Lean, Coq), GVU flows on this fiber admit spectrally stable self-improvement regimes due to oracle-like verification. Our main technical result is a density theorem: under uniform tightness of agent outputs and a Lipschitz AAI functional, the subspace of batteries generated by mathematical theorem-proving and coding tasks is dense in the moduli space of batteries with respect to the evaluation metric. Coding alone is universal in this sense, while pure mathematics is not; its privilege is spectral rather than expressive. We interpret this as evidence that mathematics and coding provide ``universal coordinates'' for evaluation, and that formal mathematics is a natural ignition domain for recursive self-improvement in advanced AI agents.

*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI) to detect hallucinations in RAG systems by measuring angular distances in embedding space. It finds that hallucinated responses stay close to questions, with SGI's discriminative power increasing with question-context separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the geometric traces of hallucinations in RAG systems, providing a tool to identify unreliable responses.

Method: Proposes SGI, the ratio of angular distances between response-question and response-context on a unit hypersphere. Tests on HaluEval and TruthfulQA datasets.

Result: Large effect sizes across models, with discriminative power rising with question-context separation. SGI is robust and calibrated, but ineffective for factual accuracy.

Conclusion: SGI efficiently identifies responses needing verification in RAG systems, but measures topical engagement, not factual correctness.

Abstract: When retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems hallucinate, what geometric trace does this leave in embedding space? We introduce the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI), defined as the ratio of angular distances from the response to the question versus the context on the unit hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.Our central finding is \emph{semantic laziness}: hallucinated responses remain angularly proximate to questions rather than departing toward retrieved contexts. On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $θ(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $θ(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $θ(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths. Calibration analysis yields ECE=0.10, indicating SGI scores can serve as probability estimates, not merely rankings. A critical negative result on TruthfulQA (AUC=0.478) establishes that angular geometry measures topical engagement rather than factual accuracy. SGI provides computationally efficient, theoretically grounded infrastructure for identifying responses that warrant verification in production RAG deployments.

TL;DR: MURIM, a multi-dimensional reputation-based incentive mechanism for Federated Learning, improves fairness, privacy, and robustness against attacks by jointly considering client reliability, privacy, and resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in Federated Learning like weak client incentives, privacy risks, and resource constraints by ensuring fair and meaningful client contributions.

Method: Proposes MURIM, which evaluates client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness, and allocates incentives based on contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a verification module.

Result: Demonstrated on datasets (MNIST, FMNIST, ADULT Income), MURIM improves fairness by 18%, reduces privacy attacks by 5-9%, and enhances robustness against attacks by up to 85%.

Conclusion: MURIM effectively mitigates adversarial threats, promotes fair participation, and ensures stable model convergence in diverse federated settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a leading privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm, enabling participants to share model updates instead of raw data. However, FL continues to face key challenges, including weak client incentives, privacy risks, and resource constraints. Assessing client reliability is essential for fair incentive allocation and ensuring that each client's data contributes meaningfully to the global model. To this end, we propose MURIM, a MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness while preventing malicious or unreliable clients from earning undeserved rewards. MURIM allocates incentives based on client contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a reliability verification module. Extensive experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and ADULT Income datasets demonstrate that MURIM achieves up to 18% improvement in fairness metrics, reduces privacy attack success rates by 5-9%, and improves robustness against poisoning and noisy-gradient attacks by up to 85% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Overall, MURIM effectively mitigates adversarial threats, promotes fair and truthful participation, and preserves stable model convergence across heterogeneous and dynamic federated settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously assess the baseline reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs on canonical graduate-level mathematical theory, specifically randomized algorithms.

Method: Benchmarked GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 by generating formal LaTeX proofs for exercises from the "Randomized Algorithms" textbook. Evaluated accuracy, conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure.

Result: Top models (Gemini, Claude) achieved ~66% accuracy, showing proficiency in probabilistic methods and logic. Other models lagged (~40% accuracy). Qualitative analysis revealed differences in proof quality.

Conclusion: Frontier LLMs are proficient for graduate-level assistance but vary in reliability for rigorous math derivation. Open-sourced data supports further research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant breakthroughs in automated mathematical reasoning and scientific discovery. Georgiev, G${ó}$mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner [GGSTW+25] demonstrate that AI systems can explore new constructions and improve existing bounds, illustrating the growing potential of LLMs to accelerate mathematical discovery. Similarly, Bubeck et al. [BCE+25] show that GPT-5 can meaningfully contribute to scientific workflows, from proposing hypotheses to generating proofs and analyses. Despite these advances, a rigorous evaluation of these models on canonical, graduate-level mathematical theory remains necessary to understand their baseline reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of four frontier models: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 against the classic curriculum of Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan [MR95].
  We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook. We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%). We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure. Our results suggest that while frontier models have reached a threshold of proficiency suitable for graduate-level pedagogical assistance and formalization, significant variance exists in their reliability for rigorous mathematical derivation. The code and the full set of LLM-generated responses are open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/magiclinux/math_benchmark_probability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies self-reflection in LLMs with CoT reasoning, introduces a framework (ReflCtrl) to control reflection frequency, and shows that reflections can be redundant, especially in stronger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how self-reflection in reasoning models affects performance and inference cost, and to find a way to control reflection frequency efficiently.

Method: Segments reasoning steps, identifies reflection steps, and extracts a reflection direction in latent space. Proposes a stepwise steering method (ReflCtrl) to control reflection frequency.

Result: Demonstrates that up to 33.6% of reasoning tokens can be saved without performance loss, and reflection behavior correlates with internal uncertainty signals.

Conclusion: Self-reflection can be redundant in stronger models and is linked to uncertainty, offering a pathway to optimize inference cost while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, including mathematics, coding, and general reasoning. A distinctive ability of these reasoning models is self-reflection: the ability to review and revise previous reasoning steps. While self-reflection enhances reasoning performance, it also increases inference cost. In this work, we study self-reflection through the lens of representation engineering. We segment the model's reasoning into steps, identify the steps corresponding to reflection, and extract a reflection direction in the latent space that governs this behavior. Using this direction, we propose a stepwise steering method that can control reflection frequency. We call our framework ReflCtrl. Our experiments show that (1) in many cases reflections are redundant, especially in stronger models (in our experiments, we can save up to 33.6 percent of reasoning tokens while preserving performance), and (2) the model's reflection behavior is highly correlated with an internal uncertainty signal, implying self-reflection may be controlled by the model's uncertainty.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DTop-p MoE, a dynamic Top-p routing mechanism for Sparse Mixture-of-Experts architectures, which adaptively adjusts expert activation to token difficulty and maintains sparsity control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Top-k routing lacks flexibility in handling varying token difficulty, while fixed-threshold Top-p routing struggles with computational costs and hyperparameter sensitivity. Addressing these limitations motivates the proposed DTop-p mechanism.

Method: DTop-p uses a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller to dynamically adjust the probability threshold for expert activation, ensuring alignment with a target sparsity. It also introduces dynamic routing normalization for layer-wise adaptation.

Result: Experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers show DTop-p outperforms Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines, maintaining precise sparsity control and adaptive resource allocation.

Conclusion: DTop-p offers a scalable, robust solution for large-scale MoE pre-training, demonstrating strong performance and adaptability across various model and dataset sizes.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures effectively scale model capacity by activating only a subset of experts for each input token. However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a natural language-based world modeling approach for GUI agents, presents a benchmark and dataset, and proposes a framework integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to improve task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior pixel-space world models face limitations in GUI settings due to difficulty in predicting visual elements. The paper explores a natural language alternative.

Method: The authors introduce MobileWorldBench for evaluating VLMs, release MobileWorld dataset (1.4M samples), and propose a framework integrating VLM world models into mobile agent planning.

Result: The semantic world models improve task success rates for mobile agents, demonstrating the utility of VLMs in GUI settings.

Conclusion: Natural language-based world models offer a practical alternative to pixel-space approaches, enhancing mobile agent performance in GUI environments.

Abstract: World models have shown great utility in improving the task performance of embodied agents. While prior work largely focuses on pixel-space world models, these approaches face practical limitations in GUI settings, where predicting complex visual elements in future states is often difficult. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of world modeling for GUI agents, where state transitions are described in natural language rather than predicting raw pixels. First, we introduce MobileWorldBench, a benchmark that evaluates the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to function as world models for mobile GUI agents. Second, we release MobileWorld, a large-scale dataset consisting of 1.4M samples, that significantly improves the world modeling capabilities of VLMs. Finally, we propose a novel framework that integrates VLM world models into the planning framework of mobile agents, demonstrating that semantic world models can directly benefit mobile agents by improving task success rates.

### [231] [Evaluating Small Language Models for Agentic On-Farm Decision Support Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14043)
*Enhong Liu,Haiyu Yang,Miel Hostens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for dairy farming decision-making, focusing on privacy, computational efficiency, and practical deployment under farm-realistic constraints. Qwen-4B performed best but requires fine-tuning for specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the gap in accessible, privacy-conscious, and computationally efficient AI tools for dairy farming, as cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are impractical for farm use.

Method: The authors benchmarked 20 open-source SLMs on HuggingFace, developed a multi-agent AI system for dairy tasks, and evaluated models in two phases using test questions.

Result: Qwen-4B outperformed other models in most task categories but showed instability in NoSQL interactions.

Conclusion: SLMs show promise for dairy farming but need further fine-tuning to enhance performance in dairy-specific tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) hold potential to support dairy scholars and farmers by supporting decision-making and broadening access to knowledge for stakeholders with limited technical expertise. However, the substantial computational demand restricts access to LLM almost exclusively through cloud-based service, which makes LLM-based decision support tools impractical for dairy farming. To address this gap, lightweight alternatives capable of running locally on farm hardware are required. In this work, we benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models (SLM) available on HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Building on our prior work, we developed an agentic AI system that integrates five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation following predictive models. Evaluation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five test questions were used for the initial screening to identify models capable of following basic dairy-related instructions and performing reliably in a compute-constrained environment. Models that passed this preliminary stage were then evaluated using 30 questions (five per task category mentioned above, plus one category addressing integrity and misconduct) in phase two. In results, Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most of task categories, although showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly evaluating the feasibility of SLM as engines for dairy farming decision-making, with central emphases on privacy and computational efficiency. While results highlight the promise of SLM-assisted tools for practical deployment in dairy farming, challenges remain, and fine-tuning is still needed to refine SLM performance in dairy-specific questions.

### [232] [Intention Chain-of-Thought Prompting with Dynamic Routing for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14048)
*Shen Li,Li Huang,Shaoxiong Zhan,Weifeng Sun,Tao Yin,Zhongxin Liu,Meng Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoutingGen is a difficulty-aware framework adapting prompting strategies for code generation—simple tasks use few-shot prompting, while complex ones use Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT) for structured reasoning. It improves performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT prompting methods induce overthinking on simple tasks and lack intention abstraction in code generation, neglecting core algorithmic design and efficiency.

Method: RoutingGen dynamically switches between few-shot prompting for simple tasks and ICoT for complex ones, focusing on task intention like algorithmic logic and time complexity.

Result: RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, reduces token usage by 46.37%, and ICoT outperforms six existing baselines.

Conclusion: RoutingGen enhances code generation by optimizing prompting strategies, balancing simplicity and complexity effectively.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities and have shown great potential in code generation. Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings. Furthermore, ICoT outperforms six existing prompting baselines on challenging benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenDataArena (ODA), a platform to benchmark post-training data for LLMs, addressing gaps in data evaluation and lineage transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM post-training datasets lack transparency in composition and evaluation, hindering reproducibility and understanding of data's impact on model behavior.

Method: ODA features a unified training-evaluation pipeline, multi-dimensional scoring framework, data lineage explorer, and open-source toolkit for comprehensive data benchmarking.

Result: Experiments on ODA reveal insights into data complexity-task performance trade-offs, benchmark redundancy, and dataset genealogical relationships.

Conclusion: ODA promotes Data-Centric AI by enabling principled data evaluation and strategic dataset composition, advancing reproducibility and understanding of data's role in LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is predicated on the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding a leaderboard, ODA envisions a shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous studies on data mixing laws and the strategic composition of foundation models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR introduces RL-based dynamic draft trees for speculative sampling in LLMs, optimizing draft model calls and achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM inference is costly and slow; existing speculative sampling lacks flexibility in draft model calls.

Method: RADAR uses reinforcement learning to dynamically generate draft trees via MDP formulation, reducing redundant computations.

Result: Achieves 3.17x-4.82x speedup over baseline across three LLMs and four tasks.

Conclusion: RADAR effectively accelerates LLM inference by dynamically optimizing draft model usage.

Abstract: Inference with modern Large Language Models (LLMs) is expensive and slow, and speculative sampling has emerged as an effective solution to this problem, however, the number of the calls to the draft model for generating candidate tokens in speculative sampling is a preset hyperparameter, lacking flexibility. To generate and utilize the candidate tokens more effectively, we propose RADAR, a novel speculative sampling method with RL-based dynamic draft trees. RADAR formulates the draft tree generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employs offline reinforcement learning to train a prediction model, which enables real-time decision on the calls to the draft model, reducing redundant computations and further accelerating inference. Evaluations across three LLMs and four tasks show that RADAR achieves a speedup of 3.17x-4.82x over the auto-regressive decoding baseline.

TL;DR: HydroGEM, a hydrological foundation model, improves streamflow quality control with self-supervised pretraining and fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods in detection and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining data quality across remote sensors is labor-intensive, necessitating an automated solution for continental-scale streamflow monitoring.

Method: HydroGEM uses a hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture with hierarchical normalization, trained via self-supervised pretraining and fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies.

Result: Achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection, 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, and zero-shot transfer success (F1 = 0.586) on international data.

Conclusion: HydroGEM offers scalable, generalizable quality control suggestions for human-in-the-loop workflows, enhancing efficiency without autonomous corrections.

Abstract: Real-time streamflow monitoring networks generate millions of observations annually, yet maintaining data quality across thousands of remote sensors remains labor-intensive. We introduce HydroGEM (Hydrological Generalizable Encoder for Monitoring), a foundation model for continental-scale streamflow quality control. HydroGEM uses two-stage training: self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations learns hydrological representations, followed by fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization. The model maintains consistent detection across correction magnitudes and aligns with operational seasonal patterns. HydroGEM is designed for human-in-the-loop workflows - outputs are quality control suggestions requiring expert review, not autonomous corrections.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ophiuchus is a tool-augmented framework enhancing MLLMs for dynamic visual grounding in medical tasks, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical MLLMs lack precision in complex tasks requiring dynamic visual focus. Ophiuchus aims to bridge this gap.

Method: A three-stage training strategy: cold-start, self-reflection fine-tuning, and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Ophiuchus outperforms SOTA methods in medical benchmarks like VQA, detection, and segmentation.

Conclusion: The framework advances medical AI agents' ability to 'think with images' via tool-integrated reasoning.

Abstract: Recent reasoning based medical MLLMs have made progress in generating step by step textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with images" through tool-integrated reasoning. Datasets, codes, and trained models will be released publicly.

*Aneesha Fernando,Surangika Ranathunga,Kristin Stock,Raj Prasanna,Christopher B. Jones*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs to automate georeferencing of complex locality descriptions in biodiversity records, achieving high accuracy with fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate georeferencing is crucial for biodiversity studies, but manual methods are labor-intensive. Existing methods struggle with relative location descriptions.

Method: Identified effective prompting patterns and fine-tuned an LLM using QLoRA on biodiversity datasets from various regions and languages.

Result: Outperformed baselines, with 65% of records within 10 km on average, reaching 85% within 10 km and 67% within 1 km for New York state.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for automating georeferencing of complex locality descriptions, especially with fine-tuning.

Abstract: Georeferencing text documents has typically relied on either gazetteer-based methods to assign geographic coordinates to place names, or on language modelling approaches that associate textual terms with geographic locations. However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data. The best results (New York state) were 85% within 10km and 67% within 1km. The selected LLM performs well for lengthy, complex descriptions, highlighting its potential for georeferencing intricate locality descriptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of formal, automated theorem proving in AI inspired the development of a novel method integrating language models and recursive decomposition.

Method: The approach uses specialized language models for Lean4 proof generation, coordinated via a multi-agent architecture, and extends the Kimina Lean Server with AST parsing for recursive proof decomposition.

Result: The system achieves a 90.4% pass rate on miniF2F without decomposition, with further improvements when decomposition is applied.

Conclusion: The introduced system, available as an open-source tool, demonstrates significant advancements in automated theorem proving and offers adaptability for future extensions.

Abstract: Formal, automated theorem proving has long been viewed as a challenge to artificial intelligence. We introduce here a new approach to computer theorem proving, one that employs specialized language models for Lean4 proof generation combined with recursive decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions. These models are coordinated through a multi-agent architecture that orchestrates autoformalization (if required), proof generation, decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions, and recursive proof (and/or decomposition) of these propositions. Without decomposition, we achieve a 90.4% pass rate on miniF2F. With decomposition, this is significantly improved. A key technical contribution lies in our extension of the Kimina Lean Server with abstract syntax tree (AST) parsing capabilities to facilitate automated, recursive proof decomposition. The system is made available on PyPI as goedels-poetry (at https://pypi.org/project/goedels-poetry ), and the open-source implementation KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry (at https://github.com/KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry ) facilitates both adaptation to alternative language models and extension with custom functionality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can autonomously build comprehensive ontologies for PD monitoring and if human-LLM collaboration improves accuracy and completeness.

Method: Four methodologies were used: OS and CoT prompts for initial LLM-driven ontology generation, followed by X-HCOME and SimX-HCOME+ for hybrid human-LLM collaboration.

Result: LLMs alone produced incomplete ontologies, while X-HCOME and SimX-HCOME+ showed significant improvements, with SimX-HCOME+ outperforming due to iterative human supervision.

Conclusion: Human-LLM collaboration is crucial for comprehensive ontology engineering in complex domains like PD, suggesting future work on specialized GPT models for ontology construction.

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the engineering of a Parkinson's Disease (PD) monitoring and alerting ontology through four key methodologies: One Shot (OS) prompt techniques, Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, X-HCOME, and SimX-HCOME+. The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.
  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.
  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.
  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.
  Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of performing large-scale edits on LLMs while maintaining high reliability, generality, and locality.

Method: Attaches a dynamic weight neuron to specific LLM layers and uses a diffusion model to conditionally generate weights based on input queries.

Result: MeG significantly outperforms existing methods in large-scale knowledge editing, especially in the Locality metric.

Conclusion: MeG is an effective approach for large-scale knowledge editing in LLMs, as demonstrated by improved performance metrics.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) is a field that studies how to modify some knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) at a low cost (compared to pre-training). Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transferability of Vehicle Dispatching Systems (VDSs) across diverse Automated Container Terminals (ACTs) is limited due to reliance on specialists, high data demands, and slow deployment. This paper addresses these challenges.

Method: Proposes PortAgent, utilizing a Virtual Expert Team (VET) of four LLM-driven experts (Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, Debugger) for VDS transfer. Uses few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge acquisition and reduces manual intervention with an automated workflow.

Result: PortAgent eliminates the need for port specialists, reduces data requirements, and speeds up deployment, making VDS transfer more efficient.

Conclusion: PortAgent demonstrates the potential of LLMs to automate and streamline VDS transferability in ACTs, addressing key operational challenges.

Abstract: Vehicle Dispatching Systems (VDSs) are critical to the operational efficiency of Automated Container Terminals (ACTs). However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions. In this workflow, a self-correction loop inspired by the LLM Reflexion framework is created

Abstract: To address the steep learning curve and reliance on complex manual file editing and command-line operations in the traditional workflow of the mainstream open-source seismic wave simulation software SPECFEM, this paper proposes an intelligent, interactive workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

### [244] [Context-Picker: Dynamic context selection using multi-stage reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14465)
*Siyuan Zhu,Chengdong Xu,Kaiqiang Ke,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Context-Picker is a reasoning-aware framework for LCQA that selects minimal sufficient context subsets using a two-stage reinforcement learning approach, outperforming traditional methods with comparable or reduced context lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for LCQA struggle with balancing context inclusion—too little misses information, while too much adds noise. This challenge is acute for factoid questions needing specific evidence.

Method: Context-Picker employs a two-stage RL schedule: recall-oriented coverage followed by precision-oriented pruning, enhanced by offline evidence distillation via Leave-One-Out for dense supervision.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show Context-Picker outperforms RAG baselines in accuracy with similar or shorter contexts, supported by its optimization schedule, reward shaping, and rationale-guided format.

Conclusion: Context-Picker effectively addresses LCQA challenges by optimizing context selection through a human-inspired, reasoning-aware framework.

Abstract: In long-context question answering (LCQA), determining the optimal amount of context for a given query is a significant challenge. Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines "minimal sufficient sets" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.

### [245] [Model-First Reasoning LLM Agents: Reducing Hallucinations through Explicit Problem Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14474)
*Annu Rana,Gaurav Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MFR improves LLM planning tasks by first creating an explicit problem model, reducing constraint violations and enhancing solutions compared to existing methods like Chain-of-Thought and ReAct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform poorly in multi-step planning tasks due to implicit state tracking and lack of explicit problem representation, leading to constraint violations and inconsistent solutions.

Method: The paper introduces Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase approach where the LLM first constructs an explicit problem model (defining entities, variables, actions, and constraints) before generating a solution plan.

Result: MFR outperforms Chain-of-Thought and ReAct across various domains (e.g., medical scheduling, logic puzzles), reducing violations and improving solution quality. Ablation studies confirm the importance of explicit modeling.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling addresses representational deficiencies in LLMs, enhancing planning robustness and interpretability. All resources are documented for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex multi-step planning tasks, showing high rates of constraint violations and inconsistent solutions. Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains. Our results suggest that many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations, highlighting explicit modeling as a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents. All prompts, evaluation procedures, and task datasets are documented to facilitate reproducibility.

TL;DR: Proposes GreedyLR, a learning rate scheduler that adapts based on loss, showing better performance in accuracy, speed, and convergence across NLP, CV, and LLM tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research relies on common schedulers like Cosine or exponential decay; the paper aims to improve training efficiency with an adaptive scheduler.

Method: GreedyLR adjusts the learning rate dynamically during training based on loss, validated through experiments on large-scale tasks and theoretical analysis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art schedulers in accuracy, speed, and convergence; includes theoretical proofs and robustness tests.

Conclusion: GreedyLR is efficient, easy to implement, and a strong candidate as a default scheduler for training.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in optimizers for training, most research works use common scheduler choices like Cosine or exponential decay. In this paper, we study \emph{GreedyLR}, a novel scheduler that adaptively adjusts the learning rate during training based on the current loss. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheduler, we conduct experiments on several NLP, CV, and LLM tasks with up to $7B$ parameters, including both fine-tuning and pre-training experiments. The results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art schedulers in terms of accuracy, speed, and convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the GreedyLR algorithm, including a proof of convergence and derivation of the optimal scaling factor $F$ that maximizes the convergence rate, along with experiments to show robustness of the algorithm to realistic noisy landscapes. Our scheduler is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and could be considered a good default scheduler for training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Universal Transformers (UTs) and identifies their performance gains on reasoning tasks like ARC-AGI stem from recurrent inductive bias and nonlinear components, not complex designs. It introduces the Universal Reasoning Model (URM), improving UT performance to state-of-the-art levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the sources of performance improvements in Universal Transformers (UTs) for reasoning tasks and enhance them further.

Method: Systematic analysis of UT variants, identifying key performance drivers. Proposes URM, which enhances UT with short convolution and truncated backpropagation.

Result: URM achieves state-of-the-art results: 53.8% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 1 and 16.0% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 2.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of recurrent inductive bias and nonlinearity in UTs for reasoning tasks and demonstrates the effectiveness of URM in advancing performance.

Abstract: Universal transformers (UTs) have been widely used for complex reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI and Sudoku, yet the specific sources of their performance gains remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically analyze UTs variants and show that improvements on ARC-AGI primarily arise from the recurrent inductive bias and strong nonlinear components of Transformer, rather than from elaborate architectural designs. Motivated by this finding, we propose the Universal Reasoning Model (URM), which enhances the UT with short convolution and truncated backpropagation. Our approach substantially improves reasoning performance, achieving state-of-the-art 53.8% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 1 and 16.0% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 2. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/zitian-gao/URM.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), a model that combines world-model rollouts and physics-centric action codes to improve physical reasoning in agents, outperforming existing methods like VLMs and GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether agents can acquire human-like reasoning through interaction and whether their performance improves with more experience, addressing limitations in current approaches like VLMs and world models.

Method: Proposes IPR, which uses world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduces PhysCode for physics-centric action alignment. The model is pretrained on 1,000+ heterogeneous games.

Result: IPR performs robustly across various levels of reasoning, surpasses GPT-5, and shows improvement with more training games and interaction steps. It also demonstrates zero-shot transfer to unseen games.

Conclusion: Physics-centric interaction is a promising path for steadily improving physical reasoning in agents, as supported by IPR's success and scalability.

Abstract: Humans learn by observing, interacting with environments, and internalizing physics and causality. Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. To study this, we introduce a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) benchmark of 1,000+ heterogeneous games that exhibit significant visual domain gaps. Existing approaches, including VLMs and world models, struggle to capture underlying physics and causality since they are not focused on core mechanisms and overfit to visual details. VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on levels from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning, and even surpasses GPT-5 overall. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning. Further demos and project details can be found at https://mybearyzhang.github.io/ipr-1.
