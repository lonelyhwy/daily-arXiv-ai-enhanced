*Yan Yang,George Bebis,Mircea Nicolescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-step generative data augmentation framework combines rule-based mask warping with GANs for realistic masked-face generation, improving diversity and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses data scarcity and distribution shift challenges in masked face detection and recognition.

Method: Proposes rule-based mask warping and unpaired image-to-image translation with GANs, plus non-mask preservation loss and noise injection.

Result: Qualitative improvements over rule-based warping alone, complementing existing GAN methods like IAMGAN.

Conclusion: Effective components pave the way for future data-centric augmentation advancements.

Abstract: Data scarcity and distribution shift pose major challenges for masked face detection and recognition. We propose a two-step generative data augmentation framework that combines rule-based mask warping with unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs, enabling the generation of realistic masked-face samples beyond purely synthetic transformations. Compared to rule-based warping alone, the proposed approach yields consistent qualitative improvements and complements existing GAN-based masked face generation methods such as IAMGAN. We introduce a non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection to stabilize training and enhance sample diversity. Experimental observations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed components and suggest directions for future improvements in data-centric augmentation for face recognition tasks.

*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Pier Luigi Dovesi,Shaghayegh Roohi,Mark Granroth-Wilding,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JARVIS introduces a self-supervised framework to enhance visual reasoning in MLLMs by integrating I-JEPA learning, improving performance on vision-centric tasks without compromising multimodal abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack proficiency in fundamental visual reasoning due to reliance on textual descriptions and language priors, leading to incomplete visual understanding.

Method: JARVIS integrates I-JEPA learning into MLLM training, using frozen vision models as encoders and training an LLM-based predictor to learn visual regularities without language supervision.

Result: JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across various LLM families without degrading multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: JARVIS effectively addresses visual reasoning limitations in MLLMs through self-supervised learning, offering significant improvements without sacrificing multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in connecting vision and language, yet their proficiency in fundamental visual reasoning tasks remains limited. This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

### [3] [City Navigation in the Wild: Exploring Emergent Navigation from Web-Scale Knowledge in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15933)
*Dwip Dalal,Utkarsh Mishra,Narendra Ahuja,Nebojsa Jojic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation and the CityNav benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' decision-making in real-world environments, showing current methods underperform and proposing Verbalization of Path (VoP) for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs are language-centric or rely on simulations, lacking evaluation of nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning needed for real-world tasks like navigation.

Method: The study introduces the Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation task and CityNav benchmark, testing agents' abilities using visual inputs alone. VoP is proposed to enhance performance by grounding reasoning with explicit cognitive maps.

Result: Current MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques underperform in the CityNav benchmark. VoP significantly improves navigation success by leveraging explicit cognitive maps.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world navigation tasks and demonstrates VoP as an effective solution for enhancing sequential decision-making abilities.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to develop embodied agents offers significant promise for addressing complex real-world tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

### [4] [R4: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for Vision-Language Models in 4D Spatio-Temporal Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15940)
*Tin Stribor Sohn,Maximilian Dillitzer,Jason J. Corso,Eric Sax*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R4 is a training-free framework that enhances vision-language models with a 4D spatio-temporal memory for improved retrieval and reasoning in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human ability to perceive and reason in four dimensions, R4 aims to equip models with structured, lifelong memory for multimodal understanding.

Method: R4 constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, enabling retrieval-augmented reasoning without training.

Result: Experiments on embodied tasks show R4 significantly improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines.

Conclusion: R4 advances embodied 4D reasoning by integrating persistent memory and collaborative retrieval, offering a new paradigm for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.

### [5] [The Perceptual Observatory Characterizing Robustness and Grounding in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15949)
*Tejas Anvekar,Fenil Bardoliya,Pavan K. Turaga,Chitta Baral,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces The Perceptual Observatory, a framework to evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on perceptual tasks, addressing gaps in current evaluation methods like robustness and visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs reuse vision encoders, raising concerns about whether their progress is due to visual grounding or reliance on textual knowledge. Current evaluations focus on end-task accuracy, missing critical aspects like robustness and attribution fidelity.

Method: The Perceptual Observatory evaluates MLLMs across tasks like face matching, text-in-vision comprehension, image matching, and attribute localization. It uses ground-truth datasets perturbed with pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based illusions.

Result: The framework provides insights into how MLLMs maintain perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion: The Perceptual Observatory offers a principled way to analyze MLLMs' perceptual capacities, moving beyond traditional accuracy metrics to inform future model development.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have yielded increasingly powerful models, yet their perceptual capacities remain poorly characterized. In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions. The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to yield insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, providing a principled foundation for analyzing strengths and weaknesses of current and future models.

### [6] [Seeing is Believing (and Predicting): Context-Aware Multi-Human Behavior Prediction with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15957)
*Utsav Panchal,Yuchen Liu,Luigi Palmieri,Ilche Georgievski,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMP-VLM is a Vision Language Model-based framework that improves multi-human behavior prediction by combining visual context and spatial awareness, outperforming baselines by up to 66.9% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective is essential for robots in human-populated environments, but lacks sufficient research and datasets.

Method: Uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) with contextual visual features and scene graphs. Fine-tuned with synthetic data from a photorealistic simulator and evaluated on synthetic and real-world sequences.

Result: CAMP-VLM achieves up to 66.9% higher prediction accuracy than the best baseline, leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Conclusion: CAMP-VLM demonstrates significant improvements in multi-human behavior prediction and generalizes well to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Accurately predicting human behaviors is crucial for mobile robots operating in human-populated environments. While prior research primarily focuses on predicting actions in single-human scenarios from an egocentric view, several robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective. To this end, we present CAMP-VLM (Context-Aware Multi-human behavior Prediction): a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework that incorporates contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs to enhance prediction of humans-scene interactions. Due to the lack of suitable datasets for multi-human behavior prediction from an observer view, we perform fine-tuning of CAMP-VLM with synthetic human behavior data generated by a photorealistic simulator, and evaluate the resulting models on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess their generalization capabilities. Leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CAMP-VLM outperforms the best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy.

### [7] [From Words to Wavelengths: VLMs for Few-Shot Multispectral Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15971)
*Manuel Nkegoum,Minh-Tan Pham,Élisa Fromont,Bruno Avignon,Sébastien Lefèvre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for few-shot multispectral object detection, demonstrating their superiority over specialized models in data-scarce and fully supervised settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multispectral object detection is vital for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, but annotated data scarcity limits deep detector training. Textual class information can provide semantic supervision.

Method: The authors adapt VLM-based detectors (Grounding DINO and YOLO-World) for multispectral inputs and propose integrating text, visual, and thermal modalities.

Result: Experiments on FLIR and M3FD benchmarks show VLM-based detectors outperform specialized models in few-shot and fully supervised settings.

Conclusion: Semantic priors from VLMs transfer effectively to unseen spectral modalities, offering a data-efficient solution for multispectral perception.

Abstract: Multispectral object detection is critical for safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance, where robust perception under diverse illumination conditions is essential. However, the limited availability of annotated multispectral data severely restricts the training of deep detectors. In such data-scarce scenarios, textual class information can serve as a valuable source of semantic supervision. Motivated by the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in computer vision, we explore their potential for few-shot multispectral object detection. Specifically, we adapt two representative VLM-based detectors, Grounding DINO and YOLO-World, to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual and thermal modalities. Through extensive experiments on two popular multispectral image benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD, we demonstrate that VLM-based detectors not only excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, but also achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings. Our findings reveal that the semantic priors learned by large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to unseen spectral modalities, ofFering a powerful pathway toward data-efficient multispectral perception.

### [8] [Are vision-language models ready to zero-shot replace supervised classification models in agriculture?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15977)
*Earl Ranario,Mason J. Earles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs benchmarked on agricultural tasks show poor standalone performance but can assist with constrained interfaces and domain-aware methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess reliability of VLMs for agricultural decision support.

Method: Benchmark open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 AgML datasets using zero-shot, multiple-choice, and open-ended prompting.

Result: VLMs underperform supervised baselines; Gemini-3 Pro tops at ~62% accuracy under multiple-choice prompting. Open-ended prompting performs poorly (~25%), improved slightly by LLM-based judging.

Conclusion: Current VLMs are unsuitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems but can assist with proper constraints and evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly proposed as general-purpose solutions for visual recognition tasks, yet their reliability for agricultural decision support remains poorly understood. We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models. Overall, these results indicate that current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems, but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.

### [9] [Eyes on the Grass: Biodiversity-Increasing Robotic Mowing Using Deep Visual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15993)
*Lars Beckers,Arno Waes,Aaron Van Campenhout,Toon Goedemé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robotic mowing system uses deep feature-space analysis to selectively preserve diverse vegetation patches, enhancing garden biodiversity without species-level supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To actively improve garden biodiversity by transforming monocultural lawns into vibrant biotopes using robotic technology.

Method: Uses ResNet50 pretrained on PlantNet300K for visual diversity analysis and a selective mowing algorithm driven by biodiversity estimates.

Result: Strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, proving deep visual diversity as a proxy for ecological richness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively boosts urban biodiversity, suggesting widespread adoption could transform ecologically poor lawns into valuable habitats.

Abstract: This paper presents a robotic mowing framework that actively enhances garden biodiversity through visual perception and adaptive decision-making. Unlike passive rewilding approaches, the proposed system uses deep feature-space analysis to identify and preserve visually diverse vegetation patches in camera images by selectively deactivating the mower blades. A ResNet50 network pretrained on PlantNet300K provides ecologically meaningful embeddings, from which a global deviation metric estimates biodiversity without species-level supervision. These estimates drive a selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation behavior. The system was implemented on a modified commercial robotic mower and validated both in a controlled mock-up lawn and on real garden datasets. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, confirming the feasibility of deep visual diversity as a proxy for ecological richness and the effectiveness of the proposed mowing decision approach. Widespread adoption of such systems will turn ecologically worthless, monocultural lawns into vibrant, valuable biotopes that boost urban biodiversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for generating video-action pairs from text instructions, initial images, and robot joint states, overcoming action annotation limitations and improving robotic policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of action annotations in video diffusion models and limitations of existing methods, such as constrained cross-modal sharing or inability to leverage pretrained video knowledge.

Method: Extends a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel action diffusion model, introduces Bridge Attention for cross-modal interaction, and refines actions for low-resolution datasets.

Result: Outperforms baselines in video quality and action accuracy, validated on public benchmarks and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable framework for robotic learning by effectively using large-scale video data.

Abstract: We present a method to generate video-action pairs that follow text instructions, starting from an initial image observation and the robot's joint states. Our approach automatically provides action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the common lack of action annotations and enabling their full use for robotic policy learning. Existing methods either adopt two-stage pipelines, which limit tightly coupled cross-modal information sharing, or rely on adapting a single-modal diffusion model for a joint distribution that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning.

### [11] [Driving in Corner Case: A Real-World Adversarial Closed-Loop Evaluation Platform for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16055)
*Jiaheng Geng,Jiatong Du,Xinyu Zhang,Ye Li,Panqu Wang,Yanjun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A closed-loop platform generates adversarial interactions for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models in real-world scenarios, revealing performance issues in corner cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical corner cases are hard to collect in real-world driving but essential for evaluating autonomous systems. Existing adversarial methods focus on simplified simulations, leaving real-world evaluations underexplored.

Method: The platform combines a real-world image generator (using flow matching) with an adversarial traffic policy to create challenging interactions and corner cases. It evaluates models like UniAD and VAD.

Result: The platform efficiently generates realistic driving images and identifies performance degradation in tested models during corner cases.

Conclusion: The platform effectively detects model vulnerabilities, aiding in improving the safety and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving.

Abstract: Safety-critical corner cases, difficult to collect in the real world, are crucial for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving. Adversarial interaction is an effective method to generate such safety-critical corner cases. While existing adversarial evaluation methods are built for models operating in simplified simulation environments, adversarial evaluation for real-world end-to-end autonomous driving has been little explored. To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases. This result indicates that this platform can effectively detect the model's potential issues, which will facilitate the safety and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving.

*Hao Tang,Hanyu Liu,Alessandro Perelli,Xi Chen,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model for enhancing low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) to high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) using prior brain anatomy and novel modules for efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating FOD from dMRI face trade-offs between accuracy (LAR-FOD) and scanning time (HAR-FOD), with diffusion models offering potential solutions but challenged by complexity.

Method: Introduces a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model with an FOD-patch adapter, voxel-level conditional coordinating module, and SH attention module to improve learning and prediction of HAR-FOD.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in HAR-FOD prediction, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: The model effectively addresses the challenges of estimating HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD, offering a promising solution for practical applications in dMRI.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a critical non-invasive technique to estimate fiber orientation distribution (FOD) for characterizing white matter integrity. Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model. We design the SH attention module to effectively learn the complex correlations of the SH coefficients. Our experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in HAR-FOD prediction and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

*Haomeng Zhang,Kuan-Chuan Peng,Suhas Lohit,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Auto-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection (AV3DOD), a method that automatically generates class names for detected objects without user input, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods still rely on user-specified classes during training and inference. The authors aim to eliminate this dependency by proposing a system that autonomously generates class names.

Method: The proposed AV3DOD framework uses 2D vision-language models to generate semantic candidates through image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion. It introduces Semantic Score (SS) to evaluate the quality of generated class names.

Result: AV3DOD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both localization (mAP) and semantic quality (SS) on ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets, outperforming the previous SOTA method, CoDA, by 3.48 mAP and improving SS by 24.5% on ScanNetV2.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that AV3DOD effectively automates the generation of class names for 3D object detection, significantly advancing the field by removing the need for user-specified classes while maintaining high performance metrics.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods are able to localize 3D boxes of classes unseen during training. Despite the name, existing methods rely on user-specified classes both at training and inference. We propose to study Auto-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection (AV3DOD), where the classes are automatically generated for the detected objects without any user input. To this end, we introduce Semantic Score (SS) to evaluate the quality of the generated class names. We then develop a novel framework, AV3DOD, which leverages 2D vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rich semantic candidates through image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion. AV3DOD achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both localization (mAP) and semantic quality (SS) on the ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. Notably, it surpasses the SOTA, CoDA, by 3.48 overall mAP and attains a 24.5% relative improvement in SS on ScanNetV2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in human pose estimation, as many SOTA models are computationally heavy, while lightweight models often sacrifice accuracy.

Method: Proposes LAPX, an improved Hourglass network with self-attention for capturing global context, refined lightweight attention modules, and advanced stage design.

Result: Achieves competitive results on MPII and COCO datasets with 2.3M parameters and demonstrates real-time performance suitable for edge devices.

Conclusion: LAPX successfully balances accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices without significant performance loss.

Abstract: Human pose estimation is a crucial task in computer vision. Methods that have SOTA (State-of-the-Art) accuracy, often involve a large number of parameters and incur substantial computational cost. Many lightweight variants have been proposed to reduce the model size and computational cost of them. However, several of these methods still contain components that are not well suited for efficient deployment on edge devices. Moreover, models that primarily emphasize inference speed on edge devices often suffer from limited accuracy due to their overly simplified designs. To address these limitations, we propose LAPX, an Hourglass network with self-attention that captures global contextual information, based on previous work, LAP. In addition to adopting the self-attention module, LAPX advances the stage design and refine the lightweight attention modules. It achieves competitive results on two benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO, with only 2.3M parameters, and demonstrates real-time performance, confirming its edge-device suitability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer advantages like high dynamic range and temporal resolution, but their geometric calibration, especially for long-range measurements, is challenging.

Method: The method involves linear solving of camera parameters using a sphere motion model and nonlinear optimization for refinement with high precision.

Result: Real-world experiments show the proposed method outperforms existing calibration methods in accuracy and reliability.

Conclusion: The presented approach effectively addresses the challenges of event camera calibration, particularly for long-distance and high-precision measurements.

Abstract: Event cameras are a new type of brain-inspired visual sensor with advantages such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. The geometric calibration of event cameras, which involves determining their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, particularly in long-range measurement scenarios, remains a significant challenge. To address the dual requirements of long-distance and high-precision measurement, we propose an event camera calibration method utilizing a collimator with flickering star-based patterns. The proposed method first linearly solves camera parameters using the sphere motion model of the collimator, followed by nonlinear optimization to refine these parameters with high precision. Through comprehensive real-world experiments across varying conditions, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing event camera calibration methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.

TurboDiffusion mainly relies on several components for acceleration: (1) Attention acceleration: TurboDiffusion uses low-bit SageAttention and trainable Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) to speed up attention computation. (2) Step distillation: TurboDiffusion adopts rCM for efficient step distillation. (3) W8A8 quantization: TurboDiffusion quantizes model parameters and activations to 8 bits to accelerate linear layers and compress the model. In addition, TurboDiffusion incorporates several other engineering optimizations.
  We conduct experiments on the Wan2.2-I2V-14B-720P, Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-480P, Wan2.1-T2V-14B-720P, and Wan2.1-T2V-14B-480P models. Experimental results show that TurboDiffusion achieves 100-200x speedup for video generation even on a single RTX 5090 GPU, while maintaining comparable video quality. The GitHub repository, which includes model checkpoints and easy-to-use code, is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/TurboDiffusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a collimator system, leveraging angle invariance and spherical motion constraints to simplify calibration processes and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera calibration is essential for photogrammetry and 3D vision, but existing methods often require complex setups. The collimator system provides a controllable environment to simplify calibration.

Method: Uses a collimator system with angle invariance constraints, reducing motion to 3DOF. Proposes linear and minimal solvers for multiple and two images, and a single-image algorithm eliminating camera motion need.

Result: The method is validated in synthetic and real-world experiments, showing superior performance over baseline methods.

Conclusion: The collimator-based approach offers a flexible, fast, and reliable solution for camera calibration, with potential applications in 3D vision and photogrammetry.

Abstract: Camera calibration is a crucial step in photogrammetry and 3D vision applications. This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to existing baseline methods.

*Ren Nakagawa,Yang Yang,Risa Shinoda,Hiroaki Santo,Kenji Oyama,Fumio Okura,Takenao Ohkawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A tool called CattleAct detects cattle interactions from images using action decomposition and contrastive learning, aiding smart livestock management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting cattle interactions is vital for livestock management (e.g., estrus detection), but lacks datasets due to rarity.

Method: CattleAct first learns cattle actions from a dataset, then fine-tunes interactions via contrastive learning for unified detection.

Result: Tests on commercial pastures show accurate interaction detection compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CattleAct offers a data-efficient solution for rare cattle interaction detection, with practical applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method and application for automatically detecting behavioral interactions between grazing cattle from a single image, which is essential for smart livestock management in the cattle industry, such as for detecting estrus. Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions. On top of the proposed method, we develop a practical working system integrating video and GPS inputs. Experiments on a commercial-scale pasture demonstrate the accurate interaction detection achieved by our method compared to the baselines. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/rakawanegan/CattleAct.

*Ze Yuan,Wenbin Li,Shusen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid reconstruction framework for DSCT combines iterative methods (OPMT) and deep learning (ResDynUNet++) to improve image quality by addressing channel imbalance and artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dual-spectral CT reconstruction by integrating knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches for faster convergence and better artifact removal.

Method: Uses OPMT for rapid intermediate reconstruction and ResDynUNet++ (a modified UNet++ with residual dynamic convolution blocks) for refinement.

Result: Effective artifact reduction and accurate reconstruction validated on synthetic and clinical datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework outperforms existing methods, offering superior DSCT image quality.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid reconstruction framework for dual-spectral CT (DSCT) that integrates iterative methods with deep learning models. The reconstruction process consists of two complementary components: a knowledge-driven module and a data-driven module. In the knowledge-driven phase, we employ the oblique projection modification technique (OPMT) to reconstruct an intermediate solution of the basis material images from the projection data. We select OPMT for this role because of its fast convergence, which allows it to rapidly generate an intermediate solution that successfully achieves basis material decomposition. Subsequently, in the data-driven phase, we introduce a novel neural network, ResDynUNet++, to refine this intermediate solution. The ResDynUNet++ is built upon a UNet++ backbone by replacing standard convolutions with residual dynamic convolution blocks, which combine the adaptive, input-specific feature extraction of dynamic convolution with the stable training of residual connections. This architecture is designed to address challenges like channel imbalance and near-interface large artifacts in DSCT, producing clean and accurate final solutions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed method.

*Yueyang Hu,Haiyong Jiang,Haoxuan Song,Jun Xiao,Hao Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegGraph introduces a novel framework for few-shot 3D part segmentation by leveraging SAM's segmentation masks and a graph-based propagation method to improve geometric feature learning and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of effectively aggregating 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D part segmentation, overcoming issues like under-segmentation and inconsistent labels by leveraging geometric structures and SAM's high-quality grouping clues.

Method: The proposed SegGraph method involves constructing a segment graph to encode geometric features, modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments, and propagating features via a graph neural network. It also uses view-direction-weighted fusion for semantic consistency.

Result: Experiments on PartNet-E show SegGraph outperforms baselines by at least 6.9% mIoU, excelling in small components and part boundaries.

Conclusion: SegGraph demonstrates superior geometric understanding and performance in few-shot 3D part segmentation, validated by significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for few-shot 3D part segmentation. Recent advances have demonstrated the significant potential of 2D foundation models for low-shot 3D part segmentation. However, it is still an open problem that how to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D. Existing methods either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglects the high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. We devise a novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method, named SegGraph, to explicitly learn geometric features encoded within SAM's segmentation masks. Our method encodes geometric features by modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments while preserving intra-segment semantic consistency. We construct a segment graph, conceptually similar to an atlas, where nodes represent segments and edges capture their spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. To enforce intra-segment semantic consistency, we map segment features to 3D points with a novel view-direction-weighted fusion attenuating contributions from low-quality segments. Extensive experiments on PartNet-E demonstrate that our method outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9 percent mIoU. Further analysis reveals that SegGraph achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating its superior geometric understanding.

*Chao Li,Dasha Hu,Chengyang Li,Yuming Jiang,Yuncheng Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C-DGPA is a novel prompt adaptation method for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) that addresses domain discrepancies by jointly optimizing marginal and conditional distribution alignment through a dual-branch architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-tuning strategies in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for UDA primarily focus on marginal distribution alignment, neglecting conditional discrepancies, which leads to issues like class prototype misalignment and degraded semantics. C-DGPA aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: C-DGPA uses a dual-branch architecture: one branch aligns marginal distributions via dynamic adversarial training, while the other aligns conditional distributions using a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to standardize semantic prompts and reduce source domain bias.

Result: Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017 demonstrate C-DGPA's superiority, achieving new state-of-the-art performance across these benchmarks.

Conclusion: C-DGPA effectively integrates domain knowledge into prompt learning through synergistic optimization of marginal and conditional distribution alignment, producing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative representations.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Directly deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with prompt tuning in downstream UDA tasks faces the signifi cant challenge of mitigating domain discrepancies. Existing prompt-tuning strategies primarily align marginal distribu tion, but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, lead ing to critical issues such as class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability. To address these lim itations, the work proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation. C-DGPA syner gistically optimizes marginal distribution alignment and con ditional distribution alignment through a novel dual-branch architecture. The marginal distribution alignment branch em ploys a dynamic adversarial training framework to bridge marginal distribution discrepancies. Simultaneously, the con ditional distribution alignment branch introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to align conditional distribu tion discrepancies by standardizing semantic prompt under standing and preventing source domain over-reliance. This dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowl edge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensur ing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative repre sentations. Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017 validate the superiority of C-DGPA. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.

TL;DR: Event cameras outperform traditional cameras in maintaining performance across day-night lighting gaps without adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cameras struggle with domain gaps, especially day-night lighting differences. Event cameras are proposed as a better alternative.

Method: Used event cameras instead of traditional cameras to address lighting condition gaps.

Result: Event cameras showed consistent performance, smaller domain-shift penalties, and better cross-domain performance than grayscale frames.

Conclusion: Event cameras are a viable alternative to traditional cameras for handling lighting condition domain gaps effectively.

Abstract: Although traditional cameras are the primary sensor for end-to-end driving, their performance suffers greatly when the conditions of the data they were trained on does not match the deployment environment, a problem known as the domain gap. In this work, we consider the day-night lighting difference domain gap. Instead of traditional cameras we propose event cameras as a potential alternative which can maintain performance across lighting condition domain gaps without requiring additional adjustments. Our results show that event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions, exhibiting domain-shift penalties that are generally comparable to or smaller than grayscale frames and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works lack flexibility for domain-specific applications, motivating Avatar4D's fine-grained control over motion and context.

Method: Avatar4D generates 4D human motion sequences with customizable pose, appearance, and environment, and validates them with Syn2Sport.

Result: State-of-the-art pose estimation models perform well on Syn2Sport, showing effectiveness in supervised learning and zero-shot transfer.

Conclusion: Avatar4D offers scalable, controllable synthetic datasets for domain-specific tasks without needing real-world data.

Abstract: We present Avatar4D, a real-world transferable pipeline for generating customizable synthetic human motion datasets tailored to domain-specific applications. Unlike prior works, which focus on general, everyday motions and offer limited flexibility, our approach provides fine-grained control over body pose, appearance, camera viewpoint, and environmental context, without requiring any manual annotations. To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments. We benchmark several state-of-the-art pose estimation models on Syn2Sport and demonstrate their effectiveness for supervised learning, zero-shot transfer to real-world data, and generalization across sports. Furthermore, we evaluate how closely the generated synthetic data aligns with real-world datasets in feature space. Our results highlight the potential of such systems to generate scalable, controllable, and transferable human datasets for diverse domain-specific tasks without relying on domain-specific real data.

TL;DR: VALOR introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework to improve radiology report generation by enhancing visual grounding and clinical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Radiology Report Generation (RRG) struggle with poor cross-modal alignment and hallucinations, limiting clinical accuracy.

Method: VALOR uses a two-stage training process: (1) textual rewards refine Med-VLM terminology, and (2) vision projection aligns with disease findings.

Result: VALOR improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: VALOR addresses key challenges in RRG, offering a robust framework for generating clinically accurate and visually grounded reports.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is a critical step toward automating healthcare workflows, facilitating accurate patient assessments, and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.

Motivation: Adaptive categorization is crucial for AI agents to handle dynamic tasks, focusing on ad-hoc categories created for specific goals rather than fixed ones.

Method: Proposes OAK, which adds learnable context tokens to frozen CLIP, optimizing with CLIP's alignment and GCD's clustering objectives.

Result: Achieves 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%, with interpretable saliency maps.

Conclusion: OAK enables adaptive, generalizable categorization with transparency, excelling in accuracy and concept discovery.

Abstract: Adaptive categorization of visual scenes is essential for AI agents to handle changing tasks. Unlike fixed common categories for plants or animals, ad-hoc categories are created dynamically to serve specific goals. We study open ad-hoc categorization: Given a few labeled exemplars and abundant unlabeled data, the goal is to discover the underlying context and to expand ad-hoc categories through semantic extension and visual clustering around it.
  Building on the insight that ad-hoc and common categories rely on similar perceptual mechanisms, we propose OAK, a simple model that introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP and optimizes with both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective.
  On Stanford and Clevr-4 datasets, OAK achieves state-of-the-art in accuracy and concept discovery across multiple categorizations, including 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%. Moreover, OAK produces interpretable saliency maps, focusing on hands for Action, faces for Mood, and backgrounds for Location, promoting transparency and trust while enabling adaptive and generalizable categorization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stable method for comparing 3D point clouds using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and a modified KL divergence, outperforming traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics for comparing point clouds are unstable or fail to capture global structure, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: The authors propose representing point clouds as GMMs on a statistical manifold and introduce the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence.

Result: MSKL provides stable, bounded values that reflect geometric variation better than traditional metrics, validated on datasets like MPI-FAUST and G-PCD.

Conclusion: The MSKL divergence offers a reliable and theoretically sound approach for 3D point cloud comparison, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Three-dimensional point clouds provide highly accurate digital representations of objects, essential for applications in computer graphics, photogrammetry, computer vision, and robotics. However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve single-view novel view synthesis (NVS) by transforming random noise into high-quality noise using an encoder-decoder network (EDN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based NVS models lack frameworks to learn high-quality noise, which can enhance generation results. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose a discretized Euler inversion method to inject semantic information into noise, creating paired datasets, and develop an EDN to transform random noise into high-quality noise.

Result: Experiments show EDN improves performance in NVS models like SV3D and MV-Adapter across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The EDN framework effectively enhances NVS models by learning and generating high-quality noise, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Single-view novel view synthesis (NVS) models based on diffusion models have recently attracted increasing attention, as they can generate a series of novel view images from a single image prompt and camera pose information as conditions. It has been observed that in diffusion models, certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better generation results than others. However, there remains a lack of dedicated learning frameworks that enable NVS models to learn such high-quality noise. To obtain high-quality initial noise from random Gaussian noise, we make the following contributions. First, we design a discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantic information into random noise, thereby constructing paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. Second, we propose a learning framework based on an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EDN can be seamlessly plugged into various NVS models, such as SV3D and MV-Adapter, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: The study explores using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and low-rank matrix approximations for image compression but finds it less efficient than JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate an alternative method for image compression due to the growing need for efficient storage and bandwidth solutions.

Method: Uses Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations, evaluated with relative Frobenius error and compression ratio, applied to grayscale and multichannel images.

Result: SVD-based compression produces visually similar images but is less efficient than standard formats. At low error levels, it can even result in larger file sizes than the original.

Conclusion: SVD and low-rank approximations are not competitive with industry-standard codecs like JPEG, JPEG2000, or WEBP for practical image compression.

Abstract: Images are a substantial portion of the internet, making efficient compression important for reducing storage and bandwidth demands. This study investigates the use of Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations for image compression, evaluating performance using relative Frobenius error and compression ratio. The approach is applied to both grayscale and multichannel images to assess its generality. Results show that the low-rank approximations often produce images that appear visually similar to the originals, but the compression efficiency remains consistently worse than established formats such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP at comparable error levels. At low tolerated error levels, the compressed representation produced by Singular Value Decomposition can even exceed the size of the original image, indicating that this method is not competitive with industry-standard codecs for practical image compression.

Method: Proposes ARMFlow with a causal context encoder and MLP-based velocity predictor, introducing Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) to reduce error accumulation.

Result: ARMFlow surpasses existing online methods by over 40% in FID and matches offline state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ARMFlow effectively addresses key limitations of online settings, offering high accuracy, low latency, and reduced error accumulation.

Abstract: 3D human reaction generation faces three main challenges:(1) high motion fidelity, (2) real-time inference, and (3) autoregressive adaptability for online scenarios. Existing methods fail to meet all three simultaneously. We propose ARMFlow, a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework that models temporal dependencies between actor and reactor motions. It consists of a causal context encoder and an MLP-based velocity predictor. We introduce Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) in training, encoding generated history instead of the ground-truth ones, to alleviate error accumulation in autoregressive generation. We further introduce the offline variant ReMFlow, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the fastest inference among offline methods. Our ARMFlow addresses key limitations of online settings by: (1) enhancing semantic alignment via a global contextual encoder; (2) achieving high accuracy and low latency in a single-step inference; and (3) reducing accumulated errors through BSCE. Our single-step online generation surpasses existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX by over 40% in FID, while matching offline state-of-the-art performance despite using only partial sequence conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks to address limited labeled data by ranking predictions or uncertainties of multi-view fusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited multi-view crowd counting datasets due to data collection and annotation challenges necessitate alternative approaches like synthetic data or semi-supervised methods.

Method: Two frameworks rank multi-view fusion models: one ranks predictions (vanilla model) and the other ranks uncertainties, both using semi-supervised training.

Result: Experiments show the proposed ranking methods outperform other semi-supervised counting approaches.

Conclusion: The semi-supervised ranking frameworks effectively improve multi-view crowd counting with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting has been proposed to deal with the severe occlusion issue of crowd counting in large and wide scenes. However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed multi-view model ranking methods compared with other semi-supervised counting methods.

Method: Uses a cGAN framework to train FLIM_PSR_k, reconstructing high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to 5-fold increased pixel size.

Result: Achieves a super-resolution factor of 5, improving image quality metrics and revealing fine architectural features.

Conclusion: FLIM_PSR_k enhances FLIM's spatial resolution, making it more viable for clinical and translational applications.

Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful quantitative technique that provides metabolic and molecular contrast, offering strong translational potential for label-free, real-time diagnostics. However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications.

*Rui Gui,Yang Wan,Haochen Han,Dongxing Mao,Fangming Liu,Min Li,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextEditBench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating text editing in images, focusing on semantic coherence and reasoning, revealing current models' limitations in context-dependent and layout-aware tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text editing in images is underexplored and challenging due to the need for legible characters while maintaining semantic and contextual coherence.

Method: The benchmark includes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios and introduces Semantic Expectation (SE) to evaluate semantic consistency and cross-modal alignment.

Result: Experiments show current models struggle with context-dependent reasoning and physical consistency, despite handling simple textual instructions.

Conclusion: TextEditBench provides a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation.

Abstract: Text rendering has recently emerged as one of the most challenging frontiers in visual generation, drawing significant attention from large-scale diffusion and multimodal models. However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration. By focusing evaluation on this long-overlooked yet fundamental capability, TextEditBench establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation.

*Mohamed Abouagour,Eleftherios Garyfallidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GFLAN introduces a two-stage generative framework for floor plan synthesis, separating topological planning and geometric realization to address architectural reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches often fail to capture architectural reasoning, such as topological relationships and functional constraints. GFLAN aims to bridge this gap.

Method: GFLAN uses a two-stage approach: Stage A allocates room centroids via convolutional architecture with dual encoders, while Stage B constructs a graph linking rooms to boundaries and regresses room boundaries using a Transformer-augmented GNN.

Result: The framework successfully decomposes floor plan synthesis into topological planning and geometric realization, improving architectural reasoning.

Conclusion: GFLAN provides a principled solution to floor plan generation by explicitly addressing architectural reasoning challenges through factorization.

Abstract: Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like semantic overlap, imbalanced labels, and complex co-occurrence hinder multi-label remote-sensing image retrieval.

Method: MACL integrates label-aware sampling, frequency-sensitive weighting, and dynamic-temperature scaling for balanced learning.

Result: MACL outperforms baselines on DLRSD, ML-AID, and WHDLD datasets, reducing semantic imbalance and improving retrieval.

Conclusion: MACL effectively tackles challenges in remote-sensing retrieval, offering better performance and reliability.

Abstract: Semantic overlap among land-cover categories, highly imbalanced label distributions, and complex inter-class co-occurrence patterns constitute significant challenges for multi-label remote-sensing image retrieval. In this article, Multi-Label Adaptive Contrastive Learning (MACL) is introduced as an extension of contrastive learning to address them. It integrates label-aware sampling, frequency-sensitive weighting, and dynamic-temperature scaling to achieve balanced representation learning across both common and rare categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (DLRSD, ML-AID, and WHDLD), show that MACL consistently outperforms contrastive-loss based baselines, effectively mitigating semantic imbalance and delivering more reliable retrieval performance in large-scale remote-sensing archives. Code, pretrained models, and evaluation scripts will be released at https://github.com/amna/MACL upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks prioritize aesthetics over fine-grained generation, prompting the need for objective evaluation using semantic segmentation.

Method: PixelArena employs semantic segmentation tasks to assess models' pixel-level generation accuracy under zero-shot conditions.

Result: Gemini 3 Pro Image demonstrates high-fidelity semantic mask generation, outperforming other models qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The study reveals progress in multi-modal LLMs' fine-grained generation and offers insights for future research on benchmarking and interpretability.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models that have image output are emerging. Many image generation benchmarks focus on aesthetics instead of fine-grained generation capabilities. In PixelArena, we propose using semantic segmentation tasks to objectively examine their fine-grained generative intelligence with pixel precision. We find the latest Gemini 3 Pro Image has emergent image generation capabilities that generate semantic masks with high fidelity under zero-shot settings, showcasing visual intelligence unseen before and true generalization in new image generation tasks. We further investigate its results, compare them qualitatively and quantitatively with those of other models, and present failure cases. The findings not only signal exciting progress in the field but also provide insights into future research related to multimodality, reasoning, interpretability and benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaverNet is a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network with 362K parameters, addressing time-varying degradations by selectively transmitting degradation-agnostic features and achieving strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one video restoration models struggle with time-varying degradations, often confusing the model with artifacts and relying on large, inefficient architectures.

Method: LaverNet introduces a novel propagation mechanism to selectively transmit degradation-agnostic features, enabling effective temporal modeling with a compact network.

Result: LaverNet achieves comparable or superior performance across benchmarks despite having less than 1% of the parameters of existing models.

Conclusion: Compact networks like LaverNet can effectively handle all-in-one video restoration, proving that lightweight models are viable for this task.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored all-in-one video restoration, which handles multiple degradations with a unified model. However, these approaches still face two challenges when dealing with time-varying degradations. First, the degradation can dominate temporal modeling, confusing the model to focus on artifacts rather than the video content. Second, current methods typically rely on large models to handle all-in-one restoration, concealing those underlying difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network, LaverNet, with only 362K parameters. To mitigate the impact of degradations on temporal modeling, we introduce a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits only degradation-agnostic features across frames. Through LaverNet, we demonstrate that strong all-in-one restoration can be achieved with a compact network. Despite its small size, less than 1\% of the parameters of existing models, LaverNet achieves comparable, even superior performance across benchmarks.

TL;DR: A fusion localization method using ridge estimation improves UAV target tracking accuracy by combining sequential imagery and laser ranging, outperforming single-information ground algorithms and enhancing robustness under limited conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and low robustness caused by multicollinearity in UAV target localization under challenging conditions like long distances and large inclination angles.

Method: Proposes a fusion localization method combining sequential imagery and laser ranging, utilizing ridge estimation to mitigate multicollinearity issues in least squares estimation.

Result: Experiments show higher localization accuracy and improved robustness compared to single-information ground algorithms, especially under limited observation conditions.

Conclusion: Ridge estimation effectively enhances UAV target localization accuracy and robustness, making it superior for challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Tracking and measuring targets using a variety of sensors mounted on UAVs is an effective means to quickly and accurately locate the target. This paper proposes a fusion localization method based on ridge estimation, combining the advantages of rich scene information from sequential imagery with the high precision of laser ranging to enhance localization accuracy. Under limited conditions such as long distances, small intersection angles, and large inclination angles, the column vectors of the design matrix have serious multicollinearity when using the least squares estimation algorithm. The multicollinearity will lead to ill-conditioned problems, resulting in significant instability and low robustness. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the serious multicollinearity under the condition of limited observation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy compared to ground localization algorithms based on single information. Moreover, the introduction of ridge estimation effectively enhances the robustness, particularly under limited observation conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is achieving optimal QoI in NVMCS systems due to dynamic vehicle participation and interrelated coverage and reliability issues.

Method: QUIDS uses Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ) and a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm to estimate reliability and allocate incentives.

Result: QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching and 10% over state-of-the-art methods, reducing map errors by 39-74%.

Conclusion: QUIDS enables cost-effective, high-quality urban monitoring without dedicated infrastructure, suitable for smart-city applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving optimal Quality of Information (QoI) in non-dedicated vehicular mobile crowdsensing (NVMCS) systems. The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms. By jointly optimizing coverage and reliability via a quality-informed incentive mechanism, QUIDS enables low-cost, high-quality urban monitoring without dedicated infrastructure, applicable to smart-city scenarios like traffic and environmental sensing.

### [40] [Collaborative Edge-to-Server Inference for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16349)
*Soochang Song,Yongjune Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage edge-to-server framework for VLMs reduces communication costs by selectively retransmitting only essential visual content, maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods discard fine-grained details when resizing images for VLM inference, leading to accuracy degradation. The goal is to preserve details while minimizing communication costs.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) Server infers on a global image and identifies an RoI using VLM attention. (2) If confidence is low, the server requests a detail-preserved local image of the RoI from the edge device and refines inference using both images.

Result: The framework significantly reduces communication costs while maintaining inference accuracy across multiple VLM architectures.

Conclusion: Selective retransmission of essential visual content achieves efficient and accurate VLM inference in edge-to-server deployments.

Abstract: We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.

### [41] [GMODiff: One-Step Gain Map Refinement with Diffusion Priors for HDR Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16357)
*Tao Hu,Weiyu Zhou,Yanjie Tu,Peng Wu,Wei Dong,Qingsen Yan,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMODiff is a one-step diffusion framework for HDR reconstruction using gain maps, addressing LDMs' limitations in dynamic range, inference cost, and hallucinations. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is significantly faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained LDMs show promise for HDR reconstruction but face challenges like limited dynamic range, high inference cost, and content hallucinations. GMODiff aims to solve these issues efficiently.

Method: GMODiff reformulates HDR reconstruction as gain map estimation, avoids full reconstruction, and uses regression priors for guidance and hallucination suppression. It achieves high-quality results in a single denoising step.

Result: Experiments show GMODiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is 100 times faster than previous LDM-based approaches.

Conclusion: GMODiff effectively addresses LDMs' limitations for HDR reconstruction, offering a fast, high-quality solution with reduced hallucinations.

Abstract: Pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have recently shown strong perceptual priors for low-level vision tasks, making them a promising direction for multi-exposure High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction. However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GMODiff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 100 faster than previous LDM-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EverybodyDance introduces a systematic solution for Identity Correspondence (IC) correctness in multi-character animation using Identity Matching Graph (IMG) and Mask-Query Attention (MQA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending pose-driven character animation to multi-character settings is challenging, especially with position swaps, due to the need for correct Identity Correspondence (IC).

Method: Uses IMG to model characters in generated and reference frames as node sets in a weighted bipartite graph. MQA computes edge weights for affinity. IC correctness is formalized as a graph metric and optimized during training. Includes strategies like identity-embedded guidance and pre-classified sampling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in IC correctness and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: EverybodyDance effectively addresses IC challenges in multi-character animation, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Consistent pose-driven character animation has achieved remarkable progress in single-character scenarios. However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EverybodyDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both IC and visual fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FVG improves Text-to-Video generation by decomposing it into three stages: Reasoning, Composition, and Temporal Synthesis, enhancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-Video models struggle with complex scenes and logical consistency due to poor initial frame construction.

Method: Introduced Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a three-stage pipeline: Reasoning (LLM rewrites prompt), Composition (T2I model creates anchor frame), and Temporal Synthesis (video model animates the scene).

Result: Sets a new state-of-the-art on T2V CompBench, improves VBench2 scores, and reduces sampling steps by 70% without performance loss.

Conclusion: FVG provides a simple, efficient, and robust solution for better video synthesis.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models can generate visually impressive results, yet they still frequently fail to compose complex scenes or follow logical temporal instructions. In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling. Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality annotated medical image data due to the labor-intensive nature of manual annotation motivates the need for a domain adaptation solution like AFDAN to enable cross-domain knowledge transfer.

Method: AFDAN integrates three modules: an Adversarial Domain Learning Module for feature transfer, a Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module for blending frequency representations, and a Spatial-Frequency Integration Module to combine spatial and frequency features for enhanced segmentation.

Result: AFDAN achieves a 90.9% IoU for vitiligo segmentation on VITILIGO2025 and 82.6% IoU on the DRIVE retinal vessel segmentation benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed AFDAN framework effectively addresses data scarcity in medical image segmentation by leveraging frequency domain alignment and cross-domain feature integration, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: High-quality annotated data plays a crucial role in achieving accurate segmentation. However, such data for medical image segmentation are often scarce due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual annotation. To address this challenge, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Domain Alignment Network (AFDAN)--a novel domain adaptation framework designed to align features in the frequency domain and alleviate data scarcity. AFDAN integrates three core components to enable robust cross-domain knowledge transfer: an Adversarial Domain Learning Module that transfers features from the source to the target domain; a Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module that blends frequency representations across domains; and a Spatial-Frequency Integration Module that combines both frequency and spatial features to further enhance segmentation accuracy across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AFDAN: it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.9% for vitiligo segmentation in the newly constructed VITILIGO2025 dataset and a competitive IoU of 82.6% on the retinal vessel segmentation benchmark DRIVE, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using Gaussian Splatting to create a unified 3D representation of human faces from uncalibrated images, enabling high-fidelity neural textures for standard graphics pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing a neutral pose of a human face from a small collection of uncalibrated images, and to enable the use of high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting in standard graphics pipelines without modifying other assets.

Method: Uses Gaussian Splatting for explicit 3D representation, leverages segmentation annotations for semantic alignment, and soft-constrains Gaussians to a triangulated surface. Also introduces a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture and lighting.

Result: Achieves accurate geometry and high-resolution albedo textures, usable in standard graphics pipelines. Demonstrates applicability in text-driven asset creation.

Conclusion: The method provides a flexible and robust way to create 3D face representations from limited images, offering high visual fidelity and compatibility with existing graphics workflows.

Abstract: We leverage increasingly popular three-dimensional neural representations in order to construct a unified and consistent explanation of a collection of uncalibrated images of the human face. Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by illustrating its use in a text-driven asset creation pipeline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrepLLM is a framework enabling LLMs to process raw Boundary Representation (Brep) data through cross-modal alignment and multi-stage fine-tuning, achieving SOTA results in 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with 3D Brep models due to their complexity; BrepLLM bridges this gap by integrating 3D geometry with natural language.

Method: BrepLLM uses a two-stage pipeline: (1) Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training with adaptive UV sampling and hierarchical BrepEncoder, and (2) Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning with progressive training strategies.

Result: BrepLLM achieves SOTA performance in 3D object classification and captioning.

Conclusion: BrepLLM effectively processes Brep data, enhancing LLMs' capability for 3D geometric and topological reasoning.

Abstract: Current token-sequence-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are not well-suited for directly processing 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) models that contain complex geometric and topological information. We propose BrepLLM, the first framework that enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language. BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling. We also construct Brep2Text, a dataset comprising 269,444 Brep-text question-answer pairs. Experiments show that BrepLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks.

*Muhammad Ibraheem Siddiqui,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountZES is a training-free framework for zero-shot object counting, using synergistic stages to refine exemplars, outperforming existing methods across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in zero-shot object counting, particularly inaccurate exemplar selection in existing methods.

Method: CountZES refines exemplars through three stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE).

Result: Demonstrated superior performance across diverse datasets and domains compared to existing ZOC methods.

Conclusion: CountZES effectively balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness for accurate zero-shot object counting.

Abstract: Object counting in complex scenes remains challenging, particularly in the zero-shot setting, where the goal is to count instances of unseen categories specified only by a class name. Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES superior performance among ZOC methods while generalizing effectively across natural, aerial and medical domains.

### [48] [Geometric Disentanglement of Text Embeddings for Subject-Consistent Text-to-Image Generation using A Single Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16443)
*Shangxun Li,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method improves subject consistency and text alignment in text-to-image diffusion models by refining text embeddings geometrically to avoid semantic leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for maintaining subject consistency in text-to-image models are computationally costly or suffer from semantic leakage, limiting visual storytelling applications.

Method: The proposed approach refines text embeddings from a geometric perspective to suppress unwanted semantics without requiring training or per-subject optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly enhances subject consistency and text alignment compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The training-free geometric refinement of text embeddings effectively addresses semantic leakage, improving performance in visual storytelling.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions but often fail to preserve subject consistency across multiple outputs, limiting their use in visual storytelling. Existing approaches rely on model fine-tuning or image conditioning, which are computationally expensive and require per-subject optimization. 1Prompt1Story, a training-free approach, concatenates all scene descriptions into a single prompt and rescales token embeddings, but it suffers from semantic leakage, where embeddings across frames become entangled, causing text misalignment. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective training-free approach that addresses semantic entanglement from a geometric perspective by refining text embeddings to suppress unwanted semantics. Extensive experiments prove that our approach significantly improves both subject consistency and text alignment over existing baselines.

*Masashi Hatano,Saptarshi Sinha,Jacob Chalk,Wei-Hong Li,Hideo Saito,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on generating realistic human motions, particularly gaze-primed sequences for picking/putting objects, using a diffusion-based model fine-tuned on curated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human motion generation is challenging, especially mimicking natural behaviors like gaze priming and reaching. The work aims to address this by leveraging existing datasets.

Method: The authors curate 23.7K gaze-primed sequences from public datasets, pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion model, and fine-tune it on goal pose/location.

Result: The model achieves 60% prime success and 89% reach success on the HD-EPIC dataset when conditioned on goal object location.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates naturalistic human motions, validated by novel metrics like 'Prime Success'.

Abstract: Human motion generation is a challenging task that aims to create realistic motion imitating natural human behaviour. We focus on the well-studied behaviour of priming an object/location for pick up or put down -- that is, the spotting of an object/location from a distance, known as gaze priming, followed by the motion of approaching and reaching the target location. To that end, we curate, for the first time, 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences for reaching target object locations from five publicly available datasets, i.e., HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, and GIMO. We pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, then fine-tune it conditioned on goal pose or location, on our curated sequences. Importantly, we evaluate the ability of the generated motion to imitate natural human movement through several metrics, including the 'Reach Success' and a newly introduced 'Prime Success' metric. On the largest dataset, HD-EPIC, our model achieves 60% prime success and 89% reach success when conditioned on the goal object location.

*Tin Stribor Sohn,Maximilian Dillitzer,Jason J. Corso,Eric Sax*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNOW is a framework integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency for unified 4D scene understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining VLMs' semantic priors with geometric perception to address the lack of grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics.

Method: Uses HDBSCAN clustering, SAM2-based segmentation, and Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP) to build a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG).

Result: Achieves precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems require spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments to ensure reliable navigation and interaction. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.

### [51] [StageVAR: Stage-Aware Acceleration for Visual Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16483)
*Senmao Li,Kai Wang,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Jian Yang,Yaxing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StageVAR is a stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models that optimizes computational efficiency by focusing on critical early steps and approximating less important late steps, achieving significant speedup with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from high computational complexity and runtime at large scales, and existing acceleration methods lack stage-awareness, leading to inefficient step selection.

Method: StageVAR analyzes the varying importance of generation stages, identifies early steps as critical for semantics and structure, and introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy for late steps using semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties.

Result: StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with minimal quality degradation (0.01 drop on GenEval, 0.26 on DPG), outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: Stage-aware design is effective for efficient VAR image generation, demonstrating the potential of targeted acceleration without additional training.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling departs from the next-token prediction paradigm of traditional Autoregressive (AR) models through next-scale prediction, enabling high-quality image generation. However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines. These results highlight stage-aware design as a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation.

*Yuan Li,Yahan Yu,Youyuan Lin,Yong-Hao Yang,Chenhui Chu,Shin'ya Nishida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach to train a model for blind image quality assessment (BIQA) by mimicking human perception-reasoning, achieving competitive performance and improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a model that replicates human-like and self-consistent reasoning for BIQA by integrating sensory cues and implicit reasoning.

Method: Collects human evaluation data, uses reinforcement learning with human annotations as rewards, and designs a reward for self-consistent reasoning via self-generated descriptions.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems and a significant improvement in human-model alignment (ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 vs. 0.443 baseline).

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges the gap between human perception-reasoning and machine-based BIQA, enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, integrating sensory cues with implicit reasoning to form self-consistent judgments. In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.

### [53] [Smile on the Face, Sadness in the Eyes: Bridging the Emotion Gap with a Multimodal Dataset of Eye and Facial Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16485)
*Kejun Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Lin Wei,Chang Tang,Yibing Zhan,Zijing Chen,Zhe Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces eye behaviors as a key emotional cue to bridge the gap between Facial Expression Recognition (FER) and Emotion Recognition (ER), proposing the EMER dataset and an effective Transformer model (EMERT) that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ER methods heavily rely on FER, but facial expressions often don't reflect genuine emotions. The paper aims to address this gap by incorporating eye behaviors as additional emotional cues.

Method: The authors construct the EMER dataset using spontaneous emotion induction and capture non-invasive eye behavior data alongside facial expressions. They develop EMERT, a Transformer model with modality-adversarial feature decoupling and multitask learning, to integrate eye behaviors with facial cues.

Result: EMERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal methods, demonstrating the value of eye behaviors in enhancing ER robustness. The EMER dataset also includes seven benchmark protocols for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of eye behaviors in ER and advances research on closing the gap between FER and ER. The EMER dataset and EMERT model are made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition (ER) is the process of analyzing and identifying human emotions from sensing data. Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance. Our EMER dataset and the trained EMERT models will be publicly available at https://github.com/kejun1/EMER.

*Huma Hafeez,Matthew Garratt,Jo Plested,Sankaran Iyer,Arcot Sowmya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-4K is a real-time object detection framework for 4K panoramic images, addressing challenges like distortion and high resolution with multi-scale detection and GhostConv-based backbone. It achieves high accuracy (0.95 mAP) and efficiency (75% faster than YOLO11).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omnidirectional 360-degree images present challenges for object detection due to distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high resolution. Existing detectors like YOLO struggle with computational demands and accuracy for such tasks.

Method: YOLO11-4K introduces a multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer for small objects and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce complexity while maintaining performance. The CVIP360 dataset (6,876 annotated frames) was created for evaluation.

Result: YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 ms per frame, 75% faster than YOLO11 (112.3 ms) and more accurate (0.95 vs. 0.908 mAP).

Conclusion: YOLO11-4K balances efficiency and precision for 4K panoramic object detection, suitable for applications like autonomous navigation and augmented reality. The method is scalable for other high-resolution tasks.

Abstract: The processing of omnidirectional 360-degree images poses significant challenges for object detection due to inherent spatial distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high-resolution inputs. Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications. While this work focuses on 4K omnidirectional images, the approach is broadly applicable to high-resolution detection tasks in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework using Grad-CAM for pneumonia classification and localization, reducing reliance on costly pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and time required for detailed pixel-level annotations in pneumonia diagnosis using chest X-rays.

Method: Utilizes image-level labels and Grad-CAM to generate heatmaps; evaluates seven pre-trained models (including Vision Transformer) under identical conditions with focal loss and patient-wise splits.

Result: Models achieved high classification accuracy (96-98%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 performing best. Grad-CAM heatmaps highlight clinically relevant regions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of weakly supervised, explainable AI models for enhancing transparency and trust in pneumonia screening.

Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, but accurately localizing the pneumonia-affected regions typically requires detailed pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time consuming to obtain. To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia-affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer, under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high classification accuracy (96--98\%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V3 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.

### [56] [PoseMoE: Mixture-of-Experts Network for Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16494)
*Mengyuan Liu,Jiajie Liu,Jinyan Zhang,Wenhao Li,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PoseMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D human pose estimation, which disentangles 2D pose and depth feature encoding to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lifting-based methods entangle 2D pose and depth features, introducing depth uncertainty and limiting accuracy. This work highlights depth representation's importance and proposes a solution.

Method: PoseMoE uses specialized expert modules to refine 2D pose and learn depth features separately, with a cross-expert aggregation module for spatio-temporal context.

Result: PoseMoE outperforms conventional lifting-based methods on Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW datasets.

Conclusion: Disentangling 2D pose and depth features significantly improves monocular 3D human pose estimation accuracy.

Abstract: The lifting-based methods have dominated monocular 3D human pose estimation by leveraging detected 2D poses as intermediate representations. The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

TL;DR: VenusBench-GD is a new bilingual, multi-platform GUI grounding benchmark addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by offering large-scale coverage, high-quality data, and hierarchical task evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding benchmarks lack sufficient data volume, domain coverage, or platform diversity, hindering comprehensive evaluation of GUI agents.

Method: VenusBench-GD introduces a cross-platform benchmark with diverse UI elements, a high-quality annotation pipeline, and a hierarchical task taxonomy (basic and advanced subtasks).

Result: Experiments show general-purpose multimodal models perform well on basic tasks, while GUI-specialized models excel in advanced tasks but suffer from overfitting and robustness issues.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for multi-tiered evaluation frameworks to assess GUI grounding models comprehensively.

Abstract: GUI grounding is a critical component in building capable GUI agents. However, existing grounding benchmarks suffer from significant limitations: they either provide insufficient data volume and narrow domain coverage, or focus excessively on a single platform and require highly specialized domain knowledge. In this work, we present VenusBench-GD, a comprehensive, bilingual benchmark for GUI grounding that spans multiple platforms, enabling hierarchical evaluation for real-word applications. VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives. Our experimental findings reveal critical insights: general-purpose multimodal models now match or even surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks. In contrast, advanced tasks, still favor GUI-specialized models, though they exhibit significant overfitting and poor robustness. These results underscore the necessity of comprehensive, multi-tiered evaluation frameworks.

*Qiushuo Cheng,Jingjing Liu,Catherine Morgan,Alan Whone,Majid Mirmehdi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised pretraining method using snippet discrimination and feature fusion for skeleton-based temporal action localization, improving performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods excel in skeleton-based action recognition but struggle with temporally sensitive features needed for action localization, prompting the need for better solutions.

Method: The authors propose a snippet discrimination pretext task for pretraining, segmenting skeleton sequences densely and enhancing features via contrastive learning. They also fuse intermediate features with a U-shaped module to improve frame-level localization.

Result: The method consistently outperforms existing contrastive learning approaches for action localization on BABEL and achieves state-of-the-art transfer learning results on PKUMMD.

Conclusion: The presented approach effectively addresses the challenges of skeleton-based temporal action localization, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: The self-supervised pretraining paradigm has achieved great success in learning 3D action representations for skeleton-based action recognition using contrastive learning. However, learning effective representations for skeleton-based temporal action localization remains challenging and underexplored. Unlike video-level {action} recognition, detecting action boundaries requires temporally sensitive features that capture subtle differences between adjacent frames where labels change. To this end, we formulate a snippet discrimination pretext task for self-supervised pretraining, which densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and promotes features that distinguish them across videos via contrastive learning. Additionally, we build on strong backbones of skeleton-based action recognition models by fusing intermediate features with a U-shaped module to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization. Our approach consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols. We also achieve state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on PKUMMD with pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL.

TL;DR: MAGINet is a network for decomposing face images into intrinsic components like diffuse albedo and other rendering passes, achieving state-of-the-art results in relighting and material editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate intrinsic decomposition of face images under unconstrained lighting is crucial for photorealistic relighting, digital doubles, and AR effects.

Method: MAGINet uses hierarchical residual encoding, attention mechanisms, and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion, followed by refinement with RefinementNet. A Pix2PixHD-based translator predicts additional rendering passes.

Result: The pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance in diffuse albedo estimation and improves fidelity for the complete rendering stack.

Conclusion: The method enables high-quality relighting and material editing of real faces.

Abstract: Accurate intrinsic decomposition of face images under unconstrained lighting is a prerequisite for photorealistic relighting, high-fidelity digital doubles, and augmented-reality effects. This paper introduces MAGINet, a Multi-scale Attention-Guided Intrinsics Network that predicts a $512\times512$ light-normalized diffuse albedo map from a single RGB portrait. MAGINet employs hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-and-channel attention in a bottleneck, and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion in the decoder, yielding sharper albedo boundaries and stronger lighting invariance than prior U-Net variants. The initial albedo prediction is upsampled to $1024\times1024$ and refined by a lightweight three-layer CNN (RefinementNet). Conditioned on this refined albedo, a Pix2PixHD-based translator then predicts a comprehensive set of five additional physically based rendering passes: ambient occlusion, surface normal, specular reflectance, translucency, and raw diffuse colour (with residual lighting). Together with the refined albedo, these six passes form the complete intrinsic decomposition. Trained with a combination of masked-MSE, VGG, edge, and patch-LPIPS losses on the FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics dataset, the full pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and demonstrates significantly improved fidelity for the complete rendering stack compared to prior methods. The resulting passes enable high-quality relighting and material editing of real faces.

*Zhiwei Li,Yitian Pang,Weining Wang,Zhenan Sun,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTP is a lightweight defense framework for VLMs that detects adversarial inputs via cosine similarity shifts and restores attention patterns for robustness without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses are costly or unreliable, necessitating a lightweight, effective solution.

Method: TTP uses cosine similarity shift detection and trainable padding for targeted adaptation at inference, optionally enhancing clean inputs.

Result: TTP outperforms existing test-time defenses, improving adversarial robustness without sacrificing clean accuracy across benchmarks.

Conclusion: TTP offers a practical, scalable defense for VLMs, balancing robustness and accuracy without requiring labeled data or retraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon.

TL;DR: The paper introduces N3D-VLM, a framework integrating native 3D object perception for improved spatial understanding in multimodal models, outperforming existing methods in 3D grounding and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to understand spatial relationships and depth in 3D scenes. The authors aim to bridge this gap.

Method: The proposed N3D-VLM framework integrates native 3D object perception, enabling direct 3D object localization and explicit 3D reasoning. A scalable data pipeline lifts 2D annotations to 3D, creating larger and diverse datasets.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D grounding tasks and surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: N3D-VLM enhances interpretable spatial understanding by combining native 3D perception with reasoning, supported by scalable data construction and improved performance metrics.

Abstract: While current multimodal models can answer questions based on 2D images, they lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.

*Kirill Mazur,Marwan Taher,Andrew J. Davison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A system reconstructs scenes from monocular RGB videos, capturing both visible and previously viewed parts by decomposing scenes into rigid 3D primitives and inferring their motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a complete, persistent 4D reconstruction of a scene from casual monocular RGB videos, enabling capabilities like replayable 3D reconstructions and object permanence.

Method: Decompose scenes into rigid 3D primitives, estimate dense 2D correspondences, and jointly infer rigid motion through optimization. Includes motion extrapolation for invisible objects.

Result: Achieves 4D spatio-temporal awareness, outperforming existing methods on object scanning and multi-object datasets quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: The system successfully provides dynamic 4D reconstructions, enhancing capabilities like multi-object scanning and object permanence compared to prior work.

Abstract: We present a dynamic reconstruction system that receives a casual monocular RGB video as input, and outputs a complete and persistent reconstruction of the scene. In other words, we reconstruct not only the the currently visible parts of the scene, but also all previously viewed parts, which enables replaying the complete reconstruction across all timesteps.
  Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.
  The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence. On object scanning and multi-object datasets, our system significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

*Yin Zhang,Yongqiang Zhang,Yaoyue Zheng,Bogdan Raducanu,Dan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning VFMs with Causal-Tune improves DGSS performance by disentangling causal and non-causal factors in feature spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook artifacts in long-term pre-trained VFMs, which degrade DGSS performance.

Method: Causal-Tune uses DCT and Gaussian band-pass filtering to separate causal/non-causal factors, refining features with learnable tokens.

Result: Achieves +4.8% mIoU improvement in adverse weather conditions (e.g., snow).

Conclusion: Causal-Tune effectively enhances domain generalization by focusing on causal features.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with a small number of parameters has shown remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.

TL;DR: CRONOS is a unified framework for voxel-level forecasting in 3D medical scans using multiple past scans, supporting both discrete and continuous timestamps, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for forecasting 3D medical scans rely on limited inputs (single prior scan, fixed grids) or target global labels, restricting voxel-level forecasting under irregular sampling.

Method: CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field to transport context volumes dynamically to a target volume at any time, operating directly in 3D voxel space.

Result: CRONOS outperforms baselines across three datasets (Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, longitudinal MRI) and remains computationally efficient.

Conclusion: CRONOS enables continuous sequence-to-image forecasting for 3D medical data, with reproducible benchmarking tools to be released.

Abstract: Forecasting how 3D medical scans evolve over time is important for disease progression, treatment planning, and developmental assessment. Yet existing models either rely on a single prior scan, fixed grid times, or target global labels, which limits voxel-level forecasting under irregular sampling. We present CRONOS, a unified framework for many-to-one prediction from multiple past scans that supports both discrete (grid-based) and continuous (real-valued) timestamps in one model, to the best of our knowledge the first to achieve continuous sequence-to-image forecasting for 3D medical data. CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports context volumes toward a target volume at an arbitrary time, while operating directly in 3D voxel space. Across three public datasets spanning Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI, CRONOS outperforms other baselines, while remaining computationally competitive. We will release code and evaluation protocols to enable reproducible, multi-dataset benchmarking of multi-context, continuous-time forecasting.

### [65] [Sketch-in-Latents: Eliciting Unified Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16584)
*Jintao Tong,Jiaqi Gu,Yujing Lou,Lubin Fan,Yixiong Zou,Yue Wu,Jieping Ye,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a paradigm enabling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform unified multimodal reasoning by generating continuous visual embeddings alongside text tokens, mimicking human-like visual-text imagination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack visual imagination capabilities despite excelling in visual understanding through text reasoning. Inspired by human ability to integrate visual and text thinking seamlessly in a unified brain space, the authors propose enhancing MLLMs to natively generate visual embeddings.

Method: SkiLa expands MLLMs' auto-regressive capabilities to generate latent sketch tokens (visual embeddings) dynamically during reasoning. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism ensures these tokens are semantically meaningful.

Result: Experiments show SkiLa excels in vision-centric tasks and generalizes well across diverse multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: SkiLa bridges the gap in MLLMs by enabling unified visual-text reasoning, achieving superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding tasks through text reasoning, they often fall short in scenarios requiring visual imagination. Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks. Codes will be released at https://github.com/TungChintao/SkiLa.

TL;DR: Yuan-TecSwin replaces CNN blocks with Swin-transformer in diffusion models to enhance long-range semantic understanding, achieving top FID scores and realistic image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The locality of CNN operations limits understanding of long-range semantic information in diffusion models.

Method: Proposes Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model using Swin-transformer blocks to replace CNN, improving text-image alignment and inference performance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet and generates images indistinguishable from human-painted ones.

Conclusion: Yuan-TecSwin successfully addresses CNN limitations and advances diffusion model performance with Swin-transformer.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis based on their U-shaped architecture and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as basic blocks. The locality of the convolution operation in CNN may limit the model's ability to understand long-range semantic information. To address this issue, we propose Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer in this work. The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones.

*Yifan Zhou,Zeqi Xiao,Tianyi Wei,Shuai Yang,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLSA introduces a hierarchical sparse attention mechanism to reduce quadratic costs in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to log-linear, improving efficiency for long token sequences without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic self-attention cost in DiTs limits scalability for long token sequences. Existing sparse attention methods still face inefficiencies due to single-level designs and increasing K requirements.

Method: LLSA employs hierarchical Top-K selection and Hierarchical KV Enrichment to reduce costs. It uses a high-performance GPU implementation for efficient training without dense attention masks.

Result: LLSA speeds up attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: LLSA provides an efficient solution for training long-sequence DiTs, demonstrating significant improvements in both speed and performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a three-stage deep learning pipeline for indoor multimedia geolocation using electric sockets as markers, addressing challenges like similar layouts and limited datasets. It achieves high accuracy in detection and classification, evaluated on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor multimedia geolocation is underdeveloped but crucial for law enforcement against crimes like human trafficking. Challenges include visual ambiguity and limited datasets.

Method: A pipeline detects sockets (YOLOv11), classifies them (Xception), and maps to countries. Uses two custom datasets for detection and classification.

Result: High accuracy: socket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classification (0.912), and country mapping (0.96). Evaluated on real-world hotel images.

Conclusion: The framework advances practical digital forensic applications. Code and datasets are open-source.

Abstract: Computer vision is a rapidly evolving field, giving rise to powerful new tools and techniques in digital forensic investigation, and shows great promise for novel digital forensic applications. One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites. This framework demonstrates a practical step toward real-world digital forensic applications. The code, trained models, and the data for this paper are available open source.

*Linghui Shen,Mingyue Cui,Xingyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeContext introduces targeted perturbations to weaken cross-attention pathways in DiT-based models, preventing unauthorized image edits while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns arising from the ease of manipulating personal images using in-context diffusion models, focusing on unauthorized edits and identity impersonation.

Method: Injects small, targeted perturbations to disrupt cross-attention layers in DiT-based models, specifically targeting early denoising steps and critical transformer blocks.

Result: Effectively blocks unwanted edits on datasets like Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit without degrading image quality.

Conclusion: Attention-based perturbations are a robust and efficient defense against image manipulation in large-scale diffusion models.

Abstract: In-context diffusion models allow users to modify images with remarkable ease and realism. However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation.

Motivation: SAR imagery faces challenges like data scarcity and speckle noise, hindering fine-grained semantic learning. The paper aims to overcome these with self-supervised learning.

Method: Proposes SARMAE, using a million-scale SAR-1M dataset, Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE) for noise robustness, and Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC) for semantic alignment with optical images.

Result: SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR classification, detection, and segmentation across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SARMAE framework effectively addresses SAR-specific challenges, demonstrating superior performance in various tasks. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing applications. However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC), which leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets demonstrate that SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REGLUE improves latent diffusion models by jointly modeling VAE latents, local VFM semantics, and global tokens, enhancing image synthesis with better FID and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) lack direct semantic supervision, leading to slow high-level semantics emergence and limited sample quality. REGLUE addresses this by better utilizing VFM features.

Method: REGLUE introduces a unified framework combining VAE latents, local VFM semantics, and a global [CLS] token in a SiT backbone. It uses a convolutional semantic compressor and external alignment loss for regularization.

Result: REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence on ImageNet 256x256, outperforming baselines like SiT-B/2, SiT-XL/2, REPA, ReDi, and REG.

Conclusion: Spatial VFM semantics, nonlinear compression, and global-local-latent joint modeling are crucial for enhancing LDMs. REGLUE demonstrates their effectiveness, with code available for further exploration.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis, yet their reconstruction-style denoising objective provides only indirect semantic supervision: high-level semantics emerge slowly, requiring longer training and limiting sample quality. Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameDiffuser is an autoregressive neural rendering framework for interactive applications, addressing limitations of existing diffusion-based methods by ensuring temporal consistency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RGBX and DiffusionRenderer lack temporal consistency or are computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for real-time interactive applications.

Method: FrameDiffuser uses G-buffer data and its own previous output for temporal guidance, employing a dual-conditioning architecture (ControlNet and ControlLoRA) and a three-stage training strategy.

Result: The model achieves stable, temporally consistent, and photorealistic frame generation over hundreds to thousands of frames, with superior lighting, shadows, and reflections in environment-specific training.

Conclusion: FrameDiffuser is a viable solution for real-time neural rendering in interactive applications, balancing quality and efficiency through environment-specific specialization.

Abstract: Neural rendering for interactive applications requires translating geometric and material properties (G-buffer) to photorealistic images with realistic lighting on a frame-by-frame basis. While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation. We specialize our model to individual environments, prioritizing consistency and inference speed over broad generalization, demonstrating that environment-specific training achieves superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Avoiding inflated model performance due to data leakage when combining open-source datasets.

Method: Uses ResNet-50 with triplet margin loss for few-shot fingerprinting, tested on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data.

Result: High Mean-Recall-@-K scores: up to 99.20% on BraTS-2021 and 99.10% on ChestXray-14.

Conclusion: Subject fingerprinting effectively mitigates data leakage and performs well in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Combining open-source datasets can introduce data leakage if the same subject appears in multiple sets, leading to inflated model performance. To address this, we explore subject fingerprinting, mapping all images of a subject to a distinct region in latent space, to enable subject re-identification via similarity matching. Using a ResNet-50 trained with triplet margin loss, we evaluate few-shot fingerprinting on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data in both standard (20-way 1-shot) and challenging (1000-way 1-shot) scenarios. The model achieves high Mean- Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS- 2021.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of deepfake detectors on localized image inpainting and editing, showing partial success in detecting medium- to large-area manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the generalizability of existing deepfake detectors, originally designed for fully synthetic images, to localized image manipulations like inpainting.

Method: A systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors on diverse datasets, varying generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques.

Result: Detectors trained on multiple generators partially transfer to inpainting detection, reliably identifying medium- to large-area manipulations and regeneration-style edits.

Conclusion: Existing detectors show promise for localized inpainting detection but require adaptation for broader generalizability.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has enabled highly realistic image manipulations, including inpainting and region-level editing. These approaches preserve most of the original visual context and are increasingly exploited in cybersecurity-relevant threat scenarios. While numerous detectors have been proposed for identifying fully synthetic images, their ability to generalize to localized manipulations remains insufficiently characterized. This work presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors, originally trained for the deepfake detection on fully synthetic images, when applied to a distinct challenge: localized inpainting detection. The study leverages multiple datasets spanning diverse generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques. Our experiments show that models trained on a large set of generators exhibit partial transferability to inpainting-based edits and can reliably detect medium- and large-area manipulations or regeneration-style inpainting, outperforming many existing ad hoc detection approaches.

TL;DR: SDFoam introduces a hybrid implicit-explicit method combining Voronoi Diagrams and Signed Distance Fields for superior mesh reconstruction while maintaining photometric quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NeRF, 3DGS, and RF struggle with precise mesh reconstruction, prompting the need for a solution that balances accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Jointly learns an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD) with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF), optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective.

Result: Produces crisper surfaces with fewer artifacts, improving mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) while preserving photometric quality and training speed.

Conclusion: SDFoam offers a robust solution for high-quality mesh reconstruction without sacrificing efficiency, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have driven impressive progress in view synthesis by using ray-traced volumetric rendering. Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam. Across diverse scenes, our hybrid implicit-explicit formulation, which we name SDFoam, substantially improves mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) with comparable appearance (PSNR, SSIM), without sacrificing efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-centre, multi-device fetal ultrasound dataset with expert annotations to improve AI-assisted fetal growth assessment by addressing variability and reproducibility issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual landmarking in fetal ultrasound is time-consuming and prone to variability, necessitating a standardized dataset for developing robust AI methods.

Method: A dataset of 4,513 fetal US images from 1,904 subjects across three sites and seven devices was created, with standardized train/test splits and baseline models.

Result: Training on single-centre data overestimates performance; multi-centre testing highlights domain shift, emphasizing the need for diverse data.

Conclusion: The dataset enables fair comparison and improves AI-assisted fetal biometry by addressing domain adaptation and multi-centre generalization.

Abstract: Accurate fetal growth assessment from ultrasound (US) relies on precise biometry measured by manually identifying anatomical landmarks in standard planes. Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres. All data, annotations, training code, and evaluation pipelines are made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OMG-Bench, a large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition, and proposes HMATr, a framework outperforming existing methods by 7.6% in detection rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of public datasets and task-specific algorithms for online micro gesture recognition in VR/AR interactions, particularly due to the subtlety and rapid dynamics of micro gestures.

Method: Develops a multi-view self-supervised pipeline for skeleton data generation and semi-automatic annotation, followed by the Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr) framework for unified gesture detection and classification.

Result: OMG-Bench includes 40 gesture classes with 13,948 instances. HMATr achieves a 7.6% improvement in detection rate over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The work provides a valuable benchmark and effective framework for online micro gesture recognition, advancing the field with improved accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: Online micro gesture recognition from hand skeletons is critical for VR/AR interaction but faces challenges due to limited public datasets and task-specific algorithms. Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, which make constructing datasets with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult. To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

*Yunkai Yang,Yudong Zhang,Kunquan Zhang,Jinxiao Zhang,Xinying Chen,Haohuan Fu,Runmin Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A task-oriented data synthesis framework (TODSynth) is proposed for remote sensing semantic segmentation, featuring a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) and a plug-and-play sampling strategy to improve synthetic data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in semantic mask control and sampling quality uncertainty in synthetic data for remote sensing (RS) semantic segmentation.

Method: Introduces TODSynth with MM-DiT (unified triple attention) and a task-guided sampling strategy. Uses text-image-mask joint attention and full fine-tuning for better control. Proposes CRFM for dynamic sampling adjustments.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing stable and task-oriented synthetic data, especially in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios.

Conclusion: TODSynth enhances synthetic data utility for RS semantic segmentation, addressing key challenges in controllable generation.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of controllable generation, training data synthesis has become a promising way to expand labeled datasets and alleviate manual annotation in remote sensing (RS). However, the complexity of semantic mask control and the uncertainty of sampling quality often limit the utility of synthetic data in downstream semantic segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented data synthesis framework (TODSynth), including a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with unified triple attention and a plug-and-play sampling strategy guided by task feedback. Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) method, which dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during the early high-plasticity stage, mitigating the instability of generated images and bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data for RS semantic segmentation.

Result: 4.83% BD-rate improvement over JPEG AI at low bitrates and 87.82% reduction in model complexity.

Conclusion: TreeNet effectively balances performance and complexity, with ablation studies providing insights into its reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: Reducing computational complexity remains a critical challenge for the widespread adoption of learning-based image compression techniques. In this work, we propose TreeNet, a novel low-complexity image compression model that leverages a binary tree-structured encoder-decoder architecture to achieve efficient representation and reconstruction. We employ attentional feature fusion mechanism to effectively integrate features from multiple branches. We evaluate TreeNet on three widely used benchmark datasets and compare its performance against competing methods including JPEG AI, a recent standard in learning-based image compression. At low bitrates, TreeNet achieves an average improvement of 4.83% in BD-rate over JPEG AI, while reducing model complexity by 87.82%. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies to investigate the influence of various latent representations within TreeNet, offering deeper insights into the factors contributing to reconstruction.

TL;DR: Make-It-Poseable is a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem, outperforming existing methods in robustness and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D character posing face challenges like inaccurate skinning weight prediction and poor pose conformance, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The framework uses a latent posing transformer to manipulate shape tokens based on skeletal motion, aided by dense pose representation, latent-space supervision, and an adaptive completion module.

Result: The method achieves superior posing quality and extends naturally to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement.

Conclusion: Make-It-Poseable offers a robust and generalized solution for 3D character posing and editing, overcoming limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Posing 3D characters is a fundamental task in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality. It also naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement.

TL;DR: FlowDet introduces Conditional Flow Matching for object detection, outperforming DiffusionDet with simpler, faster paths and better performance across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize generative transport problems in object detection and improve upon diffusion-based methods like DiffusionDet.

Method: Reformulates detection using Conditional Flow Matching, enabling variable box numbers and inference steps without retraining.

Result: Outperforms DiffusionDet by +3.6% AP on COCO and +4.2% AP_rare on LVIS, with faster performance scaling.

Conclusion: FlowDet's simpler transport paths and superior results demonstrate its effectiveness over diffusion-based detection systems.

Abstract: We present FlowDet, the first formulation of object detection using modern Conditional Flow Matching techniques. This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals. This provides gains of up to +3.6% AP and +4.2% AP$_{rare}$ over DiffusionDet on the COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively.

Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between diverse video generation tasks and create a holistic system capable of handling multimodal inputs for intelligent video content creation.

Method: The framework adopts an end-to-end approach, leveraging a comprehensive data system, large-scale pre-training strategies, and infrastructure optimizations for inference to process unified multimodal representations.

Result: Evaluations show Kling-Omni excels in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following.

Conclusion: Kling-Omni represents a significant step toward multimodal world simulators capable of dynamic and complex world interaction.

Abstract: We present Kling-Omni, a generalist generative framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly from multimodal visual language inputs. Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing real datasets lack precise annotations, while synthetic datasets often miss realistic vehicle motion. R3ST aims to bridge this gap by merging synthetic environments with real-world trajectories.

Method: R3ST generates a synthetic 3D environment and integrates real-world trajectories from SinD, a drone-recorded dataset, ensuring realistic vehicle motion and accurate annotations.

Result: The dataset provides both multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories, improving synthetic data realism for traffic analysis.

Conclusion: R3ST advances trajectory forecasting research by combining synthetic environments with real-world motion, offering a valuable tool for enhancing road safety models.

Abstract: Datasets are essential to train and evaluate computer vision models used for traffic analysis and to enhance road safety. Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.

TL;DR: KineST is a kinematics-guided state space model for realistic full-body pose reconstruction in AR/VR, balancing accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency by integrating kinematic priors and mixed spatiotemporal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reconstructing realistic full-body poses from sparse signals in AR/VR applications, where existing methods struggle with computational costs and balancing spatial-temporal dependencies.

Method: Proposes KineST, featuring kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning and mixed spatiotemporal representation learning, enhanced by geometric angular velocity loss for motion stability.

Result: KineST achieves superior accuracy and temporal consistency in lightweight frameworks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: KineST effectively integrates kinematic priors and spatiotemporal modeling, offering a robust solution for full-body motion tracking in AR/VR.

Abstract: Full-body motion tracking plays an essential role in AR/VR applications, bridging physical and virtual interactions. However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework. Project page: https://kaka-1314.github.io/KineST/

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TabReX is a reference-less, property-driven framework for evaluating table generation by LLMs, using graph-based reasoning and LLM-guided matching to assess structural and factual fidelity. It outperforms existing metrics in correlation with expert rankings and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating LLM-generated tables either ignore table structure or rely on fixed references, limiting their generalization. TabReX aims to address these shortcomings by providing a more flexible and interpretable evaluation framework.

Method: TabReX converts source text and generated tables into knowledge graphs, aligns them using LLM-guided matching, and computes rubric-aware scores for structural and factual fidelity. It introduces TabReX-Bench, a benchmark for testing robustness across domains and perturbations.

Result: TabReX shows the highest correlation with expert rankings, remains stable under challenging perturbations, and enables detailed model-vs-prompt analysis, making it a reliable and explainable evaluation tool.

Conclusion: TabReX establishes a new paradigm for trustworthy and explainable evaluation of structured generation systems, addressing limitations of existing metrics and providing fine-grained insights into table generation quality.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of tables generated by large language models (LLMs) remains an open challenge: existing metrics either flatten tables into text, ignoring structure, or rely on fixed references that limit generalization. We present TabReX, a reference-less, property-driven framework for evaluating tabular generation via graph-based reasoning. TabReX converts both source text and generated tables into canonical knowledge graphs, aligns them through an LLM-guided matching process, and computes interpretable, rubric-aware scores that quantify structural and factual fidelity. The resulting metric provides controllable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, yielding human-aligned judgments and cell-level error traces. To systematically asses metric robustness, we introduce TabReX-Bench, a large-scale benchmark spanning six domains and twelve planner-driven perturbation types across three difficulty tiers. Empirical results show that TabReX achieves the highest correlation with expert rankings, remains stable under harder perturbations, and enables fine-grained model-vs-prompt analysis establishing a new paradigm for trustworthy, explainable evaluation of structured generation systems.

TL;DR: SocialStoryFrames introduces a formalism to model nuanced reader responses to stories, validated by human surveys and expert annotations, and applied to analyze storytelling practices in online communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational models lack the ability to capture rich, interpretive reader responses like author intent or affective reactions, limiting nuanced analyses of storytelling.

Method: Developed SocialStoryFrames formalism with two models (SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier), validated via human surveys (N=382) and expert annotations, and applied to a corpus of 6,140 social media stories.

Result: The models successfully characterized storytelling intents and narrative practices across diverse communities, demonstrating their utility for large-scale storytelling research.

Conclusion: SocialStoryFrames bridges fine-grained reader response modeling with a generic taxonomy, enabling new insights into online storytelling practices.

Abstract: Reading stories evokes rich interpretive, affective, and evaluative responses, such as inferences about narrative intent or judgments about characters. Yet, computational models of reader response are limited, preventing nuanced analyses. To address this gap, we introduce SocialStoryFrames, a formalism for distilling plausible inferences about reader response, such as perceived author intent, explanatory and predictive reasoning, affective responses, and value judgments, using conversational context and a taxonomy grounded in narrative theory, linguistic pragmatics, and psychology. We develop two models, SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier, validated through human surveys (N=382 participants) and expert annotations, respectively. We conduct pilot analyses to showcase the utility of the formalism for studying storytelling at scale. Specifically, applying our models to SSF-Corpus, a curated dataset of 6,140 social media stories from diverse contexts, we characterize the frequency and interdependence of storytelling intents, and we compare and contrast narrative practices (and their diversity) across communities. By linking fine-grained, context-sensitive modeling with a generic taxonomy of reader responses, SocialStoryFrames enable new research into storytelling in online communities.

TL;DR: Exploring how personal information types impact annotator label predictions for subjective tasks, finding demographics most informative and diversity key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which personal information types best predict annotator labels for subjective tasks, given limited historical exploration.

Method: Categorizing self-disclosure sentences, building annotator models, and conducting ablations/analyses to examine information type impact.

Result: Demographics are more impactful than attitudes, relationships, or experiences; theory-based approaches and diversity improve performance.

Conclusion: Diverse demographics are most informative for predicting annotator labels, with fewer related comments needed than previously thought.

Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of personal information in the form of persona sentences or self-disclosures to improve modeling of individual characteristics and prediction of annotator labels for subjective tasks. The volume of personal information has historically been restricted and thus little exploration has gone into understanding what kind of information is most informative for predicting annotator labels. In this work, we categorize self-disclosure sentences and use them to build annotator models for predicting judgments of social norms. We perform several ablations and analyses to examine the impact of the type of information on our ability to predict annotation patterns. We find that demographics are more impactful than attitudes, relationships, and experiences. Generally, theory-based approaches worked better than automatic clusters. Contrary to previous work, only a small number of related comments are needed. Lastly, having a more diverse sample of annotator self-disclosures leads to the best performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sage introduces an evaluation suite for LLM-as-a-Judge without human annotation, using local self-consistency and global logical consistency. It reveals reliability issues in top LLMs and suggests improvements like finetuning and panel-based judging. Human judgments also show inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge rely on human-annotated data, introducing bias and scalability issues. Sage aims to provide a reliable, human-free evaluation method.

Method: Sage uses axioms of rational choice theory to measure LLM judges via local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity). It evaluates on a curated dataset of 650 questions.

Result: Experiments show Sage's metrics correlate with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2. Top LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro, GPT-5) fail consistency in ~25% of difficult cases due to situational preference. Finetuning and panel-based judges improve consistency.

Conclusion: Sage reliably evaluates LLM-as-a-Judge without human bias, revealing significant reliability issues in current models. Human judgments are inconsistent, suggesting the need for alternative standards. Methods like finetuning and deep reasoning can enhance judge performance.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely adopted as an evaluation method and served as supervised rewards in model training. However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation. Inspired by axioms of rational choice theory, Sage introduces two new lenses for measuring LLM-as-a-Judge: local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity across a full set of preferences). We curate a dataset of 650 questions by combining structured benchmark problems with real-world user queries. Our experiments demonstrate both the stability of our metrics and their high correlation with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2, confirming Sage's reliability as an evaluation suite for the robustness and accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge. Based on Sage, we reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant reliability problems when acting as judges in both scoring and pairwise settings; even the top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly a quarter of difficult cases. We attribute this to a new phenomenon called situational preference, which explains why explicit rubrics or criteria can help the model judge consistently across answer pairs. Our further analysis shows that finetuned LLM-as-a-Judge is a feasible method to boost performance, and the panel-based judge as well as deep reasoning can enhance the judging consistency. We also find substantial inconsistency in human judgments, which indicates that human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard.

Motivation: To enhance CNNs' capacity to model complex language transformations by leveraging Lie group operations.

Method: Integration of Lie Convolutions into Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, creating models SCLie and DPCLie.

Result: SCLie and DPCLie outperform traditional CNNs in sentence classification, indicating improved accuracy through non-Euclidean feature capture.

Conclusion: Lie-based models show promise for language modeling, encouraging further exploration of novel paradigms.

Abstract: Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks have been successful in capturing local, position-invariant features in text, but their capacity to model complex transformation within language can be further explored. In this work, we explore a novel approach by integrating Lie Convolutions into Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, inspired by the ability of Lie group operations to capture complex, non-Euclidean symmetries. Our proposed models SCLie and DPCLie empirically outperform traditional Convolutional-based sentence classifiers, suggesting that Lie-based models relatively improve the accuracy by capturing transformations not commonly associated with language. Our findings motivate more exploration of new paradigms in language modeling.

Conclusion: Optimizing report-level rewards for clinical correctness improves medical accuracy, demonstrating the superiority of semantic reinforcement over token-level supervision in Med-LVLM training.

Abstract: Medical report generation (MRG) aims to automatically derive radiology-style reports from medical images to aid in clinical decision-making. However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured "thinking report" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness. This work is a prior to explore semantic-reinforcement in supervising medical correctness in medical Large vision-language model(Med-LVLM) training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media spreads harmful content like hate speech and fake narratives, prompting research on detecting such phenomena.

Method: Combines NLP techniques and domain-specific pretraining for binary Faux-Hate detection and target/severity prediction.

Result: Competitive performance, showing multi-task learning's effectiveness for this challenge.

Conclusion: The system successfully addresses Faux-Hate detection, proving the value of advanced NLP and pretraining.

Abstract: Social media platforms, while enabling global connectivity, have become hubs for the rapid spread of harmful content, including hate speech and fake narratives \cite{davidson2017automated, shu2017fake}. The Faux-Hate shared task focuses on detecting a specific phenomenon: the generation of hate speech driven by fake narratives, termed Faux-Hate. Participants are challenged to identify such instances in code-mixed Hindi-English social media text. This paper describes our system developed for the shared task, addressing two primary sub-tasks: (a) Binary Faux-Hate detection, involving fake and hate speech classification, and (b) Target and Severity prediction, categorizing the intended target and severity of hateful content. Our approach combines advanced natural language processing techniques with domain-specific pretraining to enhance performance across both tasks. The system achieved competitive results, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging multi-task learning for this complex problem.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides a validated, efficient solution for transforming unstructured text into structured data, useful for specialized domains and social science research.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from police incident announcements is crucial for timely and accurate data processing, yet presents considerable challenges due to the variability and informal nature of textual sources such as social media posts. To address these challenges, we developed a domain-adapted extraction pipeline that leverages targeted prompt engineering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Qwen2.5-7B model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This approach enables the model to handle noisy, heterogeneous text while reliably extracting 15 key fields, including location, event characteristics, and impact assessment, from a high-quality, manually annotated dataset of 4,933 instances derived from 27,822 police briefing posts on Chinese Weibo (2019-2020). Experimental results demonstrated that LoRA-based fine-tuning significantly improved performance over both the base and instruction-tuned models, achieving an accuracy exceeding 98.36% for mortality detection and Exact Match Rates of 95.31% for fatality counts and 95.54% for province-level location extraction. The proposed pipeline thus provides a validated and efficient solution for multi-task structured information extraction in specialized domains, offering a practical framework for transforming unstructured text into reliable structured data in social science research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated outputs in healthcare often suffer from unreliability and hallucination risks, which are critical for decision-making and patient safety.

Method: Fine-tuning a summarization model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) on the MIMIC III dataset, paired with an independent fact-checking module that uses numerical and logical tests against EHRs.

Result: The fact-checking module achieves precision (0.8904), recall (0.8234), and F1-score (0.8556). The summarization model scores 0.5797 (ROUGE-1) and 0.9120 (BERTScore).

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances reliability of LLM outputs in healthcare, with strong performance in fact-checking and summarization.

Abstract: In healthcare, it is essential for any LLM-generated output to be reliable and accurate, particularly in cases involving decision-making and patient safety. However, the outputs are often unreliable in such critical areas due to the risk of hallucinated outputs from the LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a fact-checking module that operates independently of any LLM, along with a domain-specific summarization model designed to minimize hallucination rates. Our model is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) on the MIMIC III dataset and is paired with the fact-checking module, which uses numerical tests for correctness and logical checks at a granular level through discrete logic in natural language processing (NLP) to validate facts against electronic health records (EHRs). We trained the LLM model on the full MIMIC-III dataset. For evaluation of the fact-checking module, we sampled 104 summaries, extracted them into 3,786 propositions, and used these as facts. The fact-checking module achieves a precision of 0.8904, a recall of 0.8234, and an F1-score of 0.8556. Additionally, the LLM summary model achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 0.5797 and a BERTScore of 0.9120 for summary quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IBKE, a novel framework for editing Large Language Models (LLMs) based on information bottleneck theory, enabling precise, generalizable knowledge updates with minimal disruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Errors or outdated information in LLMs can reduce their accuracy and safety. Current editing techniques often lack generalization and cause unintended effects, highlighting the need for a more efficient and robust method.

Method: The authors propose IBKE, which uses information bottleneck theory to isolate and compress essential knowledge for editing, guiding gradient-based updates via compact latent representations.

Result: IBKE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in editing tasks across multiple LLM architectures and benchmarks, demonstrating improved generality and specificity of edits.

Conclusion: The study establishes a theoretically grounded and practical approach for open-domain knowledge editing, enhancing the reliability and utility of LLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools in science, technology, and society, enabling transformative advances across diverse fields. However, errors or outdated information within these models can undermine their accuracy and restrict their safe deployment. Developing efficient strategies for updating model knowledge without the expense and disruption of full retraining remains a critical challenge. Current model editing techniques frequently struggle to generalize corrections beyond narrow domains, leading to unintended consequences and limiting their practical impact. Here, we introduce a novel framework for editing LLMs, grounded in information bottleneck theory. This approach precisely compresses and isolates the essential information required for generalizable knowledge correction while minimizing disruption to unrelated model behaviors. Building upon this foundation, we present the Information Bottleneck Knowledge Editor (IBKE), which leverages compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates, enabling robust and broadly applicable model editing. We validate IBKE's effectiveness across multiple LLM architectures and standard benchmark tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and improved generality and specificity of edits. These findings establish a theoretically principled and practical paradigm for open-domain knowledge editing, advancing the utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: Sigma-MoE-Tiny is a highly sparse MoE language model with 96 experts per layer, activating only 0.5B parameters out of 20B total. It addresses expert load balancing challenges with progressive sparsification, achieving top-tier performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore efficient and scalable foundation models using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with extreme sparsity, addressing the challenge of expert load balancing in highly sparse settings.

Method: Develops Sigma-MoE-Tiny with fine-grained expert segmentation (96 experts per layer), activating one expert per token. Proposes a progressive sparsification schedule for expert utilization and training stability.

Result: Achieves top-tier performance despite activating only 0.5B parameters. Training remains stable without irrecoverable loss spikes.

Conclusion: Sigma-MoE-Tiny demonstrates the feasibility of highly sparse MoE models and provides insights for advancing sparsity in future architectures.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for foundation models due to its efficient and powerful scalability. In this work, we present Sigma-MoE-Tiny, an MoE language model that achieves the highest sparsity compared to existing open-source models. Sigma-MoE-Tiny employs fine-grained expert segmentation with up to 96 experts per layer, while activating only one expert for each token, resulting in 20B total parameters with just 0.5B activated. The major challenge introduced by such extreme sparsity lies in expert load balancing. We find that the widely-used load balancing loss tends to become ineffective in the lower layers under this setting. To address this issue, we propose a progressive sparsification schedule aiming to balance expert utilization and training stability. Sigma-MoE-Tiny is pre-trained on a diverse and high-quality corpus, followed by post-training to further unlock its capabilities. The entire training process remains remarkably stable, with no occurrence of irrecoverable loss spikes. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that, despite activating only 0.5B parameters, Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves top-tier performance among counterparts of comparable or significantly larger scale. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of load balancing in highly sparse MoE models, offering insights for advancing sparsity in future MoE architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding LLM performance on low-resource languages, particularly endangered Uralic ones.

Method: Evaluated GPT models using a parallel corpus of literary texts, analyzing refusal rates for translations between Finnish and four low-resource Uralic languages.

Result: Reasoning models showed 16 percentage points lower refusal rates compared to non-reasoning models.

Conclusion: Reasoning models are more effective for translating endangered languages, offering insights for preservation efforts.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translation tasks has primarily focused on high-resource languages, leaving a significant gap in understanding their performance on low-resource and endangered languages. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of OpenAI's GPT models, specifically examining the differences between reasoning and non-reasoning architectures for translating between Finnish and four low-resource Uralic languages: Komi-Zyrian, Moksha, Erzya, and Udmurt. Using a parallel corpus of literary texts, we evaluate model willingness to attempt translation through refusal rate analysis across different model architectures. Our findings reveal significant performance variations between reasoning and non-reasoning models, with reasoning models showing 16 percentage points lower refusal rates. The results provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working with Uralic languages and contribute to the broader understanding of reasoning model capabilities for endangered language preservation.

TL;DR: A method identifies adversarial texts exposing vulnerabilities in neural evaluation metrics like COMET, showing high scores across tasks despite being nonsensical translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight reliability concerns in widely used neural evaluation metrics by demonstrating their susceptibility to adversarial manipulation.

Method: Proposed approach finds a single adversarial text rated highly regardless of test cases, revealing metric vulnerabilities.

Result: The adversarial text achieved 79.1% and 67.8% COMET scores for En-Ja and En-De tasks, outperforming standard translations.

Conclusion: Neural evaluation metrics can be unreliable due to adversarial texts, emphasizing safety concerns.

Abstract: Strongly human-correlated evaluation metrics serve as an essential compass for the development and improvement of generation models and must be highly reliable and robust. Recent embedding-based neural text evaluation metrics, such as COMET for translation tasks, are widely used in both research and development fields. However, there is no guarantee that they yield reliable evaluation results due to the black-box nature of neural networks. To raise concerns about the reliability and safety of such metrics, we propose a method for finding a single adversarial text in the discrete space that is consistently evaluated as high-quality, regardless of the test cases, to identify the vulnerabilities in evaluation metrics. The single hub text found with our method achieved 79.1 COMET% and 67.8 COMET% in the WMT'24 English-to-Japanese (En--Ja) and English-to-German (En--De) translation tasks, respectively, outperforming translations generated individually for each source sentence by using M2M100, a general translation model. Furthermore, we also confirmed that the hub text found with our method generalizes across multiple language pairs such as Ja--En and De--En.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpeechLLMs aim to integrate speech into LLMs for direct translation, but cascaded systems outperform them in most cases, except specific scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether integrating speech directly into LLMs improves translation quality compared to traditional cascaded systems.

Method: The paper benchmarks 5 SpeechLLMs against 16 direct and cascade systems using SFMs and multilingual LLMs, evaluating across 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions.

Result: Cascaded systems outperform SpeechLLMs overall, which only match cascades in specific scenarios, while SFMs lag behind both.

Conclusion: Integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is crucial for high-quality speech translation.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a privacy-preserving adaptation framework using LoRA for ASR in clinical settings, achieving a 17.1% WER improvement and reducing catastrophic forgetting by 47%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR can enhance clinical documentation but faces barriers like data privacy, computational limits, and acoustic shifts, degrading model performance.

Method: Uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for continual learning on edge devices and integrates multi-domain experience replay to mitigate forgetting.

Result: Achieves a 17.1% relative WER improvement and reduces catastrophic forgetting by 47%.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for deploying reliable ASR systems in constrained environments.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) holds immense potential to streamline clinical documentation, such as digitizing handwritten prescriptions and reports, thereby increasing patient throughput and reducing costs in resource-constrained sectors like rural healthcare. However, realizing this utility is currently obstructed by significant technical barriers: strict data privacy constraints, limited computational resources, and severe acoustic domain shifts. We quantify this gap by showing that a robust multilingual model (IndicWav2Vec) degrades to a stark 40.94% Word Error Rate (WER) when deployed on real-world clinical audio (Gram Vaani), rendering it unusable for practical applications. To address these challenges and bring ASR closer to deployment, we propose an efficient, privacy-preserving adaptation framework. We employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable continual learning from incoming data streams directly on edge devices, ensuring patient data confidentiality. Our strategy yields a 17.1% relative improvement in WER on the target domain. Furthermore, by integrating multi-domain experience replay, we reduce catastrophic forgetting by 47% compared to naive adaptation. These results demonstrate a viable pathway for building reliable, self-improving ASR systems that can operate effectively within the constraints of high-impact real-world environments.

Motivation: To simplify scientific texts at sentence and document levels for better accessibility.

Method: Used GPT models (gpt-4.1 series) with no-context and fine-tuned approaches, comparing performance.

Result: gpt-4.1-mini no-context performed well; fine-tuned models were inconsistent, with gpt-4.1-nano-ft excelling in one document-level case.

Conclusion: Different GPT models and approaches yield varied simplification performance, with no-context gpt-4.1-mini being reliable overall.

Abstract: This work describes our submission to the CLEF 2025 SimpleText track Task 1, addressing both sentenceand document-level simplification of scientific texts. The methodology centered on using the gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1mini, and gpt-4.1-nano models from OpenAI. Two distinct approaches were compared: a no-context method relying on prompt engineering and a fine-tuned (FT) method across models. The gpt-4.1-mini model with no-context demonstrated robust performance at both levels of simplification, while the fine-tuned models showed mixed results, highlighting the complexities of simplifying text at different granularities, where gpt-4.1-nano-ft performance stands out at document-level simplification in one case.

TL;DR: Refusal Steering is an inference-time method to control LLM refusal behavior on politically sensitive topics without retraining, using an LLM-as-a-judge and ridge-regularized steering vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve fine-grained control over LLM refusal behavior on politically sensitive topics, avoiding the fragility of pattern-based refusal detection and maintaining model safety and performance.

Method: Uses an LLM-as-a-judge to assign refusal confidence scores and proposes ridge-regularized steering vectors to isolate refusal-compliance directions, tested on models like Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking.

Result: Successfully removes refusal behavior on politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and baseline performance. The method generalizes across different model sizes and can also induce targeted refusals.

Conclusion: Activation steering can effectively modify refusal behavior for sensitive topics while preserving safety alignment, providing a practical and transparent moderation approach at inference time.

Abstract: We introduce Refusal Steering, an inference-time method to exercise fine-grained control over Large Language Models refusal behaviour on politically sensitive topics without retraining. We replace fragile pattern-based refusal detection with an LLM-as-a-judge that assigns refusal confidence scores and we propose a ridge-regularized variant to compute steering vectors that better isolate the refusal--compliance direction. On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, our method removes the refusal behaviour of the model around politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired. We analize the steering vectors and show that refusal signals concentrate in deeper layers of the transformer and are distributed across many dimensions. Together, these results demonstrate that activation steering can remove political refusal behaviour while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time.

TL;DR: JustRL minimizes reinforcement learning complexity for large language models by using single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing compute and avoiding common pitfalls like performance collapses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper questions the necessity of increasing complexity in reinforcement learning pipelines for large language models and aims to validate a simpler, more stable baseline approach.

Method: JustRL employs single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters, avoiding multi-stage pipelines, dynamic schedules, or curriculum strategies. It evaluates performance on 1.5B reasoning models across mathematical benchmarks.

Result: JustRL achieves 54.9% and 64.3% average accuracy on benchmarks, using half the compute of complex methods. It shows smooth training without collapses and demonstrates transferability of hyperparameters.

Conclusion: The results suggest that simpler approaches can outperform complex ones, and unnecessary complexity may introduce issues. The release of models and code aims to provide a validated baseline for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for large language models have converged on increasing complexity: multi-stage training pipelines, dynamic hyperparameter schedules, and curriculum learning strategies. This raises a fundamental question: \textbf{Is this complexity necessary?} We present \textbf{JustRL}, a minimal approach using single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 1.5B reasoning models (54.9\% and 64.3\% average accuracy across nine mathematical benchmarks) while using 2$\times$ less compute than sophisticated approaches. The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training exhibits smooth, monotonic improvement over 4,000+ steps without the collapses or plateaus that typically motivate interventions. Critically, ablations reveal that adding ``standard tricks'' like explicit length penalties and robust verifiers may degrade performance by collapsing exploration. These results suggest that the field may be adding complexity to solve problems that disappear with a stable, scaled-up baseline. We release our models and code to establish a simple, validated baseline for the community.

TL;DR: GinSign framework improves NL-to-TL translation by hierarchically grounding NL spans into system signatures, achieving higher logical-equivalence scores without relying on large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate NL-to-TL translation for trustworthy autonomous systems by addressing the grounding accuracy limitations of existing frameworks.

Method: Proposes GinSign, a hierarchical grounding model that maps NL spans to system signatures via structured classification (predicting predicates first, then constants). Uses smaller masked language models instead of LLMs.

Result: Achieves 95.5% grounded logical-equivalence scores, a 1.4× improvement over SOTA, and supports downstream model checking.

Conclusion: GinSign effectively grounds NL specifications into system signatures, outperforming existing frameworks and enabling reliable formal specifications.

Abstract: Natural language (NL) to temporal logic (TL) translation enables engineers to specify, verify, and enforce system behaviors without manually crafting formal specifications-an essential capability for building trustworthy autonomous systems. While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\%$, a $1.4\times$ improvement over SOTA.

TL;DR: A reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework improves conflict-aware, interpretable retrieval-augmented generation with structured reasoning and a new evaluation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems struggle with conflicting, outdated, or subjective retrieved information, lacking unified reasoning supervision.

Method: Proposes a framework with three reasoning stages (document-level adjudication, conflict analysis, grounded synthesis) and introduces a CATS pipeline for evaluation.

Result: Significant improvements over baselines, especially with Qwen, increasing answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722.

Conclusion: The framework provides a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems, demonstrating substantial gains.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in external evidence, but fails when retrieved sources conflict or contain outdated or subjective information. Prior work address these issues independently but lack unified reasoning supervision. We propose a reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework that adds structured, interpretable reasoning across three stages : (1) document-level adjudication, (2) conflict analysis, and (3) grounded synthesis, producing citation-linked answers or justified refusals. A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline is introduced which evaluates groundedness, factual correctness, refusal accuracy, and conflict-behavior alignment using an LLM-as-a-Judge. Our 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline establish a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems. Experimental results demonstrate substantial gains over baselines, most notably with Qwen, where Supervised Fine-Tuning improved End-to-End answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal method for multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) in visually dense biomedical domains, specifically glycobiology, by comparing text conversion and OCR-free visual retrieval.

Method: Built a benchmark of 120 MCQs from 25 papers, stratified by retrieval difficulty. Implemented four augmentation methods and evaluated mid-size open-source (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-IT) and frontier proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-5 family).

Result: Mid-size models performed better with text conversion (0.722-0.740 accuracy), while frontier models (GPT-4o, GPT-5) showed competitive results with OCR-free retrieval (up to 0.828 accuracy). ColFlor emerged as an efficient retriever.

Conclusion: Pipeline choice depends on model capacity: text conversion suits mid-size models, while OCR-free retrieval is competitive with frontier models. ColFlor is an efficient default retriever.

Abstract: Multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) promises grounded biomedical QA, but it is unclear when to (i) convert figures/tables into text versus (ii) use optical character recognition (OCR)-free visual retrieval that returns page images and leaves interpretation to the generator. We study this trade-off in glycobiology, a visually dense domain. We built a benchmark of 120 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from 25 papers, stratified by retrieval difficulty (easy text, medium figures/tables, hard cross-evidence). We implemented four augmentations-None, Text RAG, Multi-modal conversion, and late-interaction visual retrieval (ColPali)-using Docling parsing and Qdrant indexing. We evaluated mid-size open-source and frontier proprietary models (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-IT, GPT-4o family). Additional testing used the GPT-5 family and multiple visual retrievers (ColPali/ColQwen/ColFlor). Accuracy with Agresti-Coull 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was computed over 5 runs per configuration. With Gemma-3-27B-IT, Text and Multi-modal augmentation outperformed OCR-free retrieval (0.722-0.740 vs. 0.510 average accuracy). With GPT-4o, Multi-modal achieved 0.808, with Text 0.782 and ColPali 0.745 close behind; within-model differences were small. In follow-on experiments with the GPT-5 family, the best results with ColPali and ColFlor improved by ~2% to 0.828 in both cases. In general, across the GPT-5 family, ColPali, ColQwen, and ColFlor were statistically indistinguishable. GPT-5-nano trailed larger GPT-5 variants by roughly 8-10%. Pipeline choice is capacity-dependent: converting visuals to text lowers the reader burden and is more reliable for mid-size models, whereas OCR-free visual retrieval becomes competitive under frontier models. Among retrievers, ColFlor offers parity with heavier options at a smaller footprint, making it an efficient default when strong generators are available.

*S. K. Rithvik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Anubuddhi is a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language, combining intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation. It achieves high design-simulation alignment and democratizes experiment design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable the design and simulation of quantum optics experiments without specialized programming knowledge, making computational experiment design accessible for research and education.

Method: Uses a three-tier toolbox for semantic retrieval, intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim) to compose and validate optical layouts.

Result: Achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations accurately modeling physics. Free-form simulation outperforms constrained frameworks in 11/13 experiments.

Conclusion: Anubuddhi democratizes quantum optics experiment design, producing strong initial designs for iterative refinement, though numerical accuracy requires expert review.

Abstract: We present Anubuddhi, a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts without requiring specialized programming knowledge. The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.

### [108] [The Principle of Proportional Duty: A Knowledge-Duty Framework for Ethical Equilibrium in Human and Artificial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15740)
*Timothy Prescher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a framework showing how ethical responsibility adjusts with uncertainty, balancing action and repair duties mathematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ethical frameworks fail to address decision-making under uncertainty effectively, prompting the need for a dynamic model like PPD.

Method: PPD uses the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)] to formalize duty allocation, validated via Monte Carlo simulations and applied across four domains.

Result: Systems with a humility coefficient (lambda > 0) show stable duty allocation, reducing overconfidence risks. PPD proves viable in clinical ethics, law, governance, and AI.

Conclusion: PPD provides a mathematically sound, cross-disciplinary framework for ethical decision-making, balancing epistemic confidence and contextual risk.

Abstract: Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty, treating it as a simple constraint on action. This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).
  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.
  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.

### [109] [Prompt-to-Parts: Generative AI for Physical Assembly and Scalable Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15743)
*David Noever*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework generates valid assembly instructions from natural language using a parts vocabulary, ensuring geometric validity and buildability, demonstrated with brick-based prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to bridge the gap between natural language design intent and manufacturable output, addressing limitations of traditional CAD models and pixel-based methods.

Method: Utilizes LDraw as an intermediate representation, guided large language models with tools to produce valid construction sequences, and introduces a Python library for programmatic model generation.

Result: Successfully generates step-by-step assembly instructions for complex prototypes like satellites and aircraft, demonstrating scalability and modularity.

Conclusion: The proposed 'bag of bricks' method acts as a physical API, offering a repeatable AI representation that connects natural language to manufacturable outputs.

Abstract: We present a framework for generating physically realizable assembly instructions from natural language descriptions. Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications. The work proposes a novel elemental lingua franca as a key missing piece from the previous pixel-based diffusion methods or computer-aided design (CAD) models that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange. Across four original designs, this novel "bag of bricks" method thus functions as a physical API: a constrained vocabulary connecting precisely oriented brick locations to a "bag of words" through which arbitrary functional requirements compile into material reality. Given such a consistent and repeatable AI representation opens new design options while guiding natural language implementations in manufacturing and engineering prototyping.

*Shaun Baek,Sam Liu,Joseph Ukpong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with symbol grounding in asymmetric environments, showing a "Success Gap" due to communicative errors. Active querying improves collaboration compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Privileged Information Bias in LLMs, where Leaders fail to guide Followers due to lack of Theory of Mind, inhibiting effective collaboration.

Method: Proposed an Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework in AI2-THOR, comparing "Pull-based" (active querying) and "Push-based" instructions.

Result: Collaborative success was 17.0% vs. Leader's 35.0%, showing a "Success Gap." Active querying doubled clarification requests and improved robustness.

Conclusion: Active uncertainty reduction is crucial for effective collaboration between human-AI and robot-robot teams, highlighting the need for better grounding protocols.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) act as powerful reasoning engines but struggle with "symbol grounding" in embodied environments, particularly when information is asymmetrically distributed. We investigate the Privileged Information Bias (or "Curse of Knowledge"), where a knowledgeable "Leader" agent fails to guide a sensor-limited "Follower" due to a lack of Theory of Mind. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR. Our experiments reveal a significant "Success Gap": while the Leader successfully perceives the target in 35.0% of episodes, the collaborative team succeeds only 17.0% of the time, implying that nearly 50% of feasible plans fail solely due to communicative grounding errors. We demonstrate that a "Pull-based" protocol (active querying) is significantly more robust than standard "Push-based" instruction, with successful episodes featuring 2x the frequency of clarification requests. This research isolates the mechanism of active uncertainty reduction as a prerequisite for safe human-AI and robot-robot collaboration.

### [111] [AI Epidemiology: achieving explainable AI through expert oversight patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15783)
*Kit Tempest-Walters*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI Epidemiology is a framework for governing AI systems using population-level surveillance methods, standardizing AI-expert interactions to predict output failures without requiring model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bypass the complexity of current interpretability methods (like SHAP) and enable governance of AI systems without requiring deep machine learning expertise.

Method: The method involves standardizing AI-expert interactions into structured fields (risk, alignment, accuracy scores) and validating associations with expert overrides and real-world outcomes.

Result: The framework provides automatic audit trails, governance continuity during model updates, and enables experts to detect unreliable AI outputs preemptively.

Conclusion: AI Epidemiology democratizes AI oversight by allowing domain experts to govern AI systems effectively, reducing reliance on technical expertise.

Abstract: AI Epidemiology is a framework for governing and explaining advanced AI systems by applying population-level surveillance methods to AI outputs. The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.
  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.
  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise.

### [112] [Beyond Training: Enabling Self-Evolution of Agents with MOBIMEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15784)
*Zibin Liu,Cheng Zhang,Xi Zhao,Yunfei Feng,Bingyu Bai,Dahu Feng,Erhu Feng,Yubin Xia,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOBIMEM is a memory-centric agent system that enables iterative self-evolution of LLM agents without model retraining, improving personalization, capability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-centric LLM agent architectures struggle with self-evolution post-deployment, requiring costly retraining and facing trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.

Method: MOBIMEM introduces three memory primitives (Profile, Experience, and Action Memory) and OS-inspired services (scheduler, AgentRR, exception handling) to decouple evolution from model weights.

Result: MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment, 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than baselines), 50.3% higher task success rates, and 9x lower latency on mobile devices.

Conclusion: MOBIMEM successfully addresses the limitations of model-centric approaches by leveraging memory-centric design for efficient and adaptive agent evolution.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex workflows in mobile and desktop environments. However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.
  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.
  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.

*Richard Fox,Rui Li,Gustav Jonsson,Farzaneh Goli,Miying Yang,Emel Aktas,Yongjing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel decision-making framework for circular economy triage uses a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning graph to optimize sustainable pathways for products like EV batteries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for adaptive decisions in circular economy triage to balance retained value against processing costs and constraints.

Method: A deterministic solver over a state-augmented DSP graph, integrating condition-aware utility and operational constraints for recursive evaluation.

Result: Demonstrated flexibility through hierarchical triage of EV batteries, accommodating varying complexity, safety, and economic factors.

Conclusion: The framework provides a generalizable and tractable foundation for optimizing CE triage decisions across diverse products and contexts.

Abstract: Circular economy (CE) triage is the assessment of products to determine which sustainable pathway they can follow once they reach the end of their usefulness as they are currently being used. Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.

### [114] [PediatricAnxietyBench: Evaluating Large Language Model Safety Under Parental Anxiety and Pressure in Pediatric Consultations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15894)
*Vahideh Zolfaghari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) for pediatric guidance under adversarial pressures, finding vulnerabilities despite model scale. Adversarial queries reduce safety, especially urgency-driven ones, with seizures and post-vaccination cases being critical. A benchmark (PediatricAnxietyBench) is introduced for reproducible adversarial evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of understanding of LLM safety in pediatric guidance under real-world adversarial pressures, such as urgent parental queries, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers.

Method: Researchers assessed two Llama models (70B and 8B) using PediatricAnxietyBench, a benchmark of 300 queries (150 patient-derived, 150 adversarial). A multi-dimensional safety framework evaluated diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition.

Result: The 70B model outperformed the 8B model in safety (6.26 vs 4.95) with fewer critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8%, with urgency causing the largest drop. Vulnerabilities were notable in seizures and post-vaccination cases. Hedging strongly correlated with safety, but emergency recognition was lacking.

Conclusion: LLMs show vulnerabilities to realistic parental pressures, though larger models perform better. PediatricAnxietyBench highlights clinically significant failure modes, offering a reusable framework for adversarial evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted by parents for pediatric guidance, yet their safety under real-world adversarial pressures is poorly understood. Anxious parents often use urgent language that can compromise model safeguards, potentially causing harmful advice. PediatricAnxietyBench is an open-source benchmark of 300 high-quality queries across 10 pediatric topics (150 patient-derived, 150 adversarial) enabling reproducible evaluation. Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41). The 70B model outperformed the 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95, p<0.001) with lower critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.02). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging strongly correlated with safety (r=0.68, p<0.001), while emergency recognition was absent. Model scale influences safety, yet all models showed vulnerabilities to realistic parental pressures. PediatricAnxietyBench provides a reusable adversarial evaluation framework to reveal clinically significant failure modes overlooked by standard benchmarks.

TL;DR: AMUSE benchmark and RAFT framework address MLLMs' weaknesses in multi-speaker, agentic reasoning tasks, improving performance by 39.52%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with multi-speaker, dialogue-centric tasks requiring agentic reasoning, highlighting the need for better multimodal audio-video understanding.

Method: Introduced AMUSE benchmark with agentic tasks and RAFT framework integrating reward optimization and selective parameter adaptation.

Result: RAFT improved accuracy by up to 39.52% on AMUSE tasks.

Conclusion: AMUSE and RAFT enhance MLLMs' agentic reasoning capabilities for multimodal interactions.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen3-Omni show strong perception but struggle in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric settings that demand agentic reasoning tracking who speaks, maintaining roles, and grounding events across time. These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate concerns like cost, speed, safety, and confidence when querying LLMs directly by pre-extracting information into a structured, query-able knowledge graph.

Method: DV extracts and structures knowledge from LLMs into a SQL database, addressing issues like erroneous or inconsistent responses, and includes a browser-based GUI for ease of use.

Result: DV provides a structured, terminology-mapped knowledge base with features to mitigate LLM response issues, released as open-source software.

Conclusion: DV aims to improve healthcare by enabling safe and effective use of pre-extracted LLM knowledge, though users must be aware of potential risks and bugs.

Abstract: Many large language models (LLMs) are trained on a massive body of knowledge present on the Internet. Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database ("knowledge base" or "knowledge graph"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Users need to be cognizant of the potential risks and benefits of using DV and its outputs, and users are responsible for ensuring any use is safe and effective. DV should be assumed to have bugs, potentially very serious ones. However, the author hopes that appropriate use of current and future versions of DV and its outputs can help improve healthcare.

### [117] [Leveraging Spreading Activation for Improved Document Retrieval in Knowledge-Graph-Based RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15922)
*Jovan Pavlović,Miklós Krész,László Hajdu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel RAG framework using spreading activation on automatically constructed knowledge graphs to improve retrieval and reasoning for complex tasks, outperforming standard RAG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG systems treat all retrieved information equally, ignoring varying credibility and interconnectedness. GraphRAG improves this but relies on costly or unreliable graph representations.

Method: The proposed framework uses spreading activation to retrieve information from documents linked by automatically built knowledge graphs, enhancing LLM performance on complex tasks.

Result: The method outperforms or matches iterative RAG, with a 39% gain in answer correctness when combined with chain-of-thought retrieval, even with small models.

Conclusion: The framework offers a plug-and-play solution for RAG systems, improving complex reasoning tasks without requiring expensive or high-quality graph representations.

Abstract: Despite initial successes and a variety of architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems still struggle to reliably retrieve and connect the multi-step evidence required for complicated reasoning tasks. Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: This paper explores replacing Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimized Small Language Models (SLMs) for cost efficiency and operational effectiveness, achieving notable success in task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational costs of LLMs hinder their routine enterprise use, prompting the study of SLMs as a viable, cost-effective alternative.

Method: The study fine-tuned the facebook/opt-350m model using Hugging Face TRL's Supervised Fine-Tuning trainer for tasks like summarization and query answering.

Result: The fine-tuned SLM achieved a 77.55% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, outperforming benchmarks like ChatGPT-CoT and ToolLLaMA variants.

Conclusion: Targeted training of SLMs can significantly reduce costs and barriers to generative AI adoption, making them practical for large-scale enterprise use.

Abstract: As organizations scale adoption of generative AI, model cost optimization and operational efficiency have emerged as critical factors determining sustainability and accessibility. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\%). These findings emphasize that thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower barriers to adoption, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how humans synthesize objective functions and extending this ability to artificial systems.

Method: Introduces subjective functions—higher-order, agent-endogenous goals—and examines expected prediction error as a case study.

Result: Connects the proposed framework to psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

Conclusion: Subjective functions offer a promising model for understanding and replicating goal-setting in artificial agents.

Abstract: Where do objective functions come from? How do we select what goals to pursue? Human intelligence is adept at synthesizing new objective functions on the fly. How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability? This paper proposes an approach to answering these questions, starting with the concept of a subjective function, a higher-order objective function that is endogenous to the agent (i.e., defined with respect to the agent's features, rather than an external task). Expected prediction error is studied as a concrete example of a subjective function. This proposal has many connections to ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models lack consistent superiority, prompting the need for an interpretable ensemble approach leveraging LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Method: Repurposes LLMs as intelligent judges via R1-style finetuning with SHAP-based faithfulness scores, enabling causal interpretation of ensemble weights and multi-turn conversations for adaptive refinement.

Result: Outperforms leading models on CRPS and MASE metrics across 23 datasets in the GIFT-Eval benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates LLMs into time series forecasting, enhancing ensemble performance and interpretability.

Abstract: The proliferation of time series foundation models has created a landscape where no single method achieves consistent superiority, framing the central challenge not as finding the best model, but as orchestrating an optimal ensemble with interpretability. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

### [121] [Do Large Language Models Know What They Don't Know? Kalshibench: A New Benchmark for Evaluating Epistemic Calibration via Prediction Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16030)
*Lukas Nel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KalshiBench, a benchmark for evaluating epistemic calibration in LLMs using real-world prediction market questions, revealing systematic overconfidence across models despite their performance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether large language models (LLMs) can appropriately quantify uncertainty about unknown future events, contrasting traditional benchmarks that focus on static knowledge accuracy.

Method: The authors created KalshiBench, a dataset of 300 prediction market questions with verifiable outcomes, and evaluated five advanced LLMs for their calibration and accuracy.

Result: All models showed systematic overconfidence, with reasoning-enhanced models exhibiting worse calibration despite similar accuracy. Only one model outperformed base rate predictions.

Conclusion: Scaling and reasoning enhancements do not inherently improve calibration, indicating epistemic calibration as a distinct capability needing focused development.

Abstract: A well-calibrated model should express confidence that matches its actual accuracy -- when it claims 80\% confidence, it should be correct 80\% of the time. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their epistemic calibration remains poorly understood. We introduce \textbf{KalshiBench}, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring after model training cutoffs. Unlike traditional benchmarks measuring accuracy on static knowledge, KalshiBench evaluates whether models can appropriately quantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events. We evaluate five frontier models -- Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B, and Kimi-K2 -- and find \textbf{systematic overconfidence across all models}. Even the best-calibrated model (Claude Opus 4.5, ECE=0.120) shows substantial calibration errors, while reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh exhibit \emph{worse} calibration (ECE=0.395) despite comparable accuracy. Critically, only one model achieves a positive Brier Skill Score, indicating most models perform worse than simply predicting base rates. Our findings suggest that scaling and enhanced reasoning do not automatically confer calibration benefits, highlighting epistemic calibration as a distinct capability requiring targeted development.

*Diane Myung-kyung Woodbridge,Allyson Seba,Freddie Seba,Aydin Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the rise of GenAI in education, its benefits and concerns, and introduces an automated system to categorize AI-related policies for better integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty around GenAI policies in education and promote responsible use by providing structured policy information.

Method: Combines unsupervised topic modeling and LLMs (like GPT-4) to classify AI policies from syllabi and institutional websites.

Result: Achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery and high precision/recall (up to 0.97) for policy classification.

Conclusion: The tool aids equitable and pedagogically aligned GenAI use in education and can be integrated into edtech platforms.

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) becomes increasingly capable of delivering personalized learning experiences and real-time feedback, a growing number of students are incorporating these tools into their academic workflows. They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics. By providing structured and interpretable policy information, this tool promotes the safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned use of GenAI technologies in education. Furthermore, the system can be integrated into educational technology platforms to help students understand and comply with relevant guidelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with balancing domain knowledge and tool integration in personalized music recommendation scenarios.

Method: The framework integrates knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning, with continued pretraining on a 50B music corpus and tool invocation.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements over existing models in relevance, personalization, and diversity.

Conclusion: WeMusic-Agent effectively enhances conversational music recommendation by combining internalized knowledge and tool use, supported by a new benchmark.

Abstract: Personalized music recommendation in conversational scenarios usually requires a deep understanding of user preferences and nuanced musical context, yet existing methods often struggle with balancing specialized domain knowledge and flexible tool integration. This paper proposes WeMusic-Agent, a training framework for efficient LLM-based conversational music recommendation. By integrating the knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning, the framework aims to teach the model to intelligently decide when to leverage internalized knowledge and when to call specialized tools (e.g., music retrieval APIs, music recommendation systems). Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions, including relevance, personalization, and diversity of the recommendations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data pipelines are costly and lack capabilities like multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection. ToolForge addresses these gaps.

Method: ToolForge synthesizes tool-learning data using virtual tools and a (question, golden context, answer) triple, enhanced by multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection. A Multi-Layer Validation Framework ensures data quality.

Result: An 8B-parameter model trained on ToolForge's data outperforms GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: ToolForge offers a cost-effective, high-quality solution for tool-learning data generation, enabling superior model performance.

Abstract: Training LLMs to invoke tools and leverage retrieved information necessitates high-quality, diverse data. However, existing pipelines for synthetic data generation often rely on tens of thousands of real API calls to enhance generalization, incurring prohibitive costs while lacking multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolForge, an automated synthesis framework that achieves strong real-world tool-calling performance by constructing only a small number of virtual tools, eliminating the need for real API calls. ToolForge leverages a (question, golden context, answer) triple to synthesize large-scale tool-learning data specifically designed for multi-hop search scenarios, further enriching the generated data through multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms. To ensure data fidelity, we employ a Multi-Layer Validation Framework that integrates both rule-based and model-based assessments. Empirical results show that a model with only 8B parameters, when trained on our synthesized data, outperforms GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Buycar-arb/ToolForge .

*Gourab Ghatak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Weighted K-Harmonic Means (WKHM) clustering algorithm, a stabilized version of K-harmonic means with soft assignment capabilities, particularly useful for wireless network user association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a clustering method that ensures numerical stability and allows soft assignments, with direct applicability in wireless networks for user association based on signal strength.

Method: The method involves proposing WKHM, a regularized variant of K-harmonic means, with convergence proofs under deterministic and stochastic settings (fixed, Binomial Point Process, and decay conditions initialization).

Result: Results include rigorous convergence guarantees and superior performance in simulations, outperforming other clustering methods in balancing signal strength and load fairness.

Conclusion: WKHM is validated as an effective tool for radio node placement and user association in wireless networks, with strong theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: We propose the \emph{weighted K-harmonic means} (WKHM) clustering algorithm, a regularized variant of K-harmonic means designed to ensure numerical stability while enabling soft assignments through inverse-distance weighting. Unlike classical K-means and constrained K-means, WKHM admits a direct interpretation in wireless networks: its weights are exactly equivalent to fractional user association based on received signal strength. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees under both deterministic and stochastic settings, addressing key technical challenges arising from non-convexity and random initialization. Specifically, we prove monotone descent to a local minimum under fixed initialization, convergence in probability under Binomial Point Process (BPP) initialization, and almost sure convergence under mild decay conditions. These results provide the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering. Finally, through extensive simulations with diverse user distributions, we show that WKHM achieves a superior tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines, making it a principled tool for joint radio node placement and user association in wireless networks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDE-Agent, a multi-agent framework leveraging LLMs and external tools for automated PDE solving, improving autonomy and performance over traditional methods and existing neural network approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE solving methods are manual and rely on expertise, while existing neural network solutions like PINNs lack full autonomy. PDE-Agent aims to automate the process by combining LLM reasoning and tool collaboration.

Method: PDE-Agent uses a Prog-Act framework with graph memory for dynamic planning and error correction, and a Resource-Pool with tool-parameter separation for managing multi-tool collaboration.

Result: Evaluations show PDE-Agent outperforms existing methods in complex tasks, demonstrating superior applicability and performance in automated PDE solving.

Conclusion: The framework advances automated scientific computing, offering a new paradigm for PDE solving with potential for future developments. The code and dataset will be publicly released.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone of engineering and scientific research. Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks. This new paradigm of toolchain-augmented multi-agent PDE solving will further advance future developments in automated scientific computing. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPRITE, a framework that synthesizes scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data using simulators and LLMs, improving VLM performance on spatial benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial understanding due to rigid template-based datasets or unscalable manual annotation. SPRITE aims to bridge this gap by programmatically generating precise and diverse data.

Method: SPRITE reframes ground-truth generation as code-generation, using LLMs to compile spatial questions into executable programs verified by simulator meta-information.

Result: The framework created a dataset of 300k+ pairs, significantly boosting VLM performance on spatial benchmarks, outperforming other datasets of similar size.

Conclusion: SPRITE demonstrates that overcoming template-based limitations is key for robust spatial intelligence, with the framework and dataset being released for future research.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence, is fundamentally constrained by the limited spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of current models. Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.

*Aniruddha Roy,Jyoti Patel,Aman Chadha,Vinija Jain,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlignMerge is a geometry-aware framework for merging LLMs, ensuring alignment preservation while matching or exceeding expert performance on tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard merging methods often disrupt alignment unintentionally, necessitating a geometry-aware approach to maintain safety and performance.

Method: AlignMerge uses a local Fisher chart and optimizes a loss function combining geometry, alignment, and budget constraints, leveraging the AQI metric.

Result: AlignMerge outperforms other methods in alignment metrics and task performance across five model families, with less alignment drift.

Conclusion: AlignMerge demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of alignment-preserving merging, paving the way for safer foundation model composition.

Abstract: Merging large language models (LLMs) is a practical way to compose capabilities from multiple fine-tuned checkpoints without retraining. Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.
  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:
  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,
  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.
  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agent-side approach for LLMs to align their cognitive timelines with asynchronous environments by predicting waiting durations, minimizing overhead and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the temporal gap in non-blocking, latency-variable agentic tasks, moving beyond limiting synchronous MDP solutions.

Method: Extends Code-as-Action paradigm to temporal domain using semantic priors and In-Context Learning for precise waiting predictions.

Result: Successful calibration of agent internal clocks in simulated Kubernetes, reducing query overhead and execution latency.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is a learnable, critical capability for autonomous agents in open-ended environments.

Abstract: Real-world agentic tasks, unlike synchronous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), often involve non-blocking actions with variable latencies, creating a fundamental \textit{Temporal Gap} between action initiation and completion. Existing environment-side solutions, such as blocking wrappers or frequent polling, either limit scalability or dilute the agent's context window with redundant observations. In this work, we propose an \textbf{Agent-side Approach} that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively align their \textit{Cognitive Timeline} with the physical world. By extending the Code-as-Action paradigm to the temporal domain, agents utilize semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL) to predict precise waiting durations (\texttt{time.sleep(t)}), effectively synchronizing with asynchronous environment without exhaustive checking. Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate that agents can precisely calibrate their internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency, validating that temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuadSentinel is a four-agent guard system designed to improve safety enforcement for large language model-based agents by compiling deployer-written policies into machine-checkable rules, reducing ambiguity and false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety risks in language model-based agents due to ambiguous natural language policies and unreliable enforcement.

Method: QuadSentinel uses a four-agent framework (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, referee) to compile policies into machine-checkable rules and enforce them hierarchically.

Result: Demonstrates improved guardrail accuracy, rule recall, and reduced false positives on benchmarks ST-WebAgentBench and AgentHarm.

Conclusion: QuadSentinel offers a deployable solution for better safety control without modifying core agents, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Safety risks arise as large language model-based agents solve complex tasks with tools, multi-step plans, and inter-agent messages. However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yyiliu/QuadSentinel.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OS-Oracle, a framework for improving critic models in GUI tasks, featuring a scalable data pipeline, a two-stage training method, and a benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable step-level decision-making is a bottleneck for deploying computer-using agents (CUAs), as errors accumulate in long-horizon workflows, necessitating critic models to assess actions before execution.

Method: OS-Oracle includes a scalable data pipeline for GUI critic data synthesis, a two-stage training paradigm (SFT and CP-GRPO), and OS-Critic Bench for evaluating critic models across platforms.

Result: OS-Oracle-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance on OS-Critic Bench, outperforms proprietary models in mobile tasks, and enhances the performance of native GUI agents in environments like OSWorld and AndroidWorld.

Conclusion: OS-Oracle addresses the lack of diverse GUI feedback data and public benchmarks, offering an effective solution for critic models in GUI tasks, with open-sourced code for broader use.

Abstract: With VLM-powered computer-using agents (CUAs) becoming increasingly capable at graphical user interface (GUI) navigation and manipulation, reliable step-level decision-making has emerged as a key bottleneck for real-world deployment. In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples. The resulting critic model, OS-Oracle-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, and surpasses proprietary models on the mobile domain. Furthermore, when serving as a pre-critic, OS-Oracle-7B improves the performance of native GUI agents such as UI-TARS-1.5-7B in OSWorld and AndroidWorld environments.

TL;DR: ForenAgent is a novel multi-round interactive framework for image forgery detection (IFD) that combines low-level tools and MLLMs, improving flexibility and interpretability through iterative refinement and dynamic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IFD methods struggle to unify low-level artifacts and high-level semantic knowledge due to their heterogeneity. ForenAgent aims to bridge this gap by enabling MLLMs to autonomously generate and refine tools.

Method: Proposes ForenAgent with a two-stage training pipeline (Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning) and a dynamic reasoning loop for flexible tool interaction. Uses FABench dataset for evaluation.

Result: ForenAgent demonstrates emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on IFD tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ForenAgent offers a promising approach for general-purpose IFD by effectively integrating low-level and high-level information streams.

Abstract: Existing image forgery detection (IFD) methods either exploit low-level, semantics-agnostic artifacts or rely on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with high-level semantic knowledge. Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD. The code will be released after the review process is completed.

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework for adapting agentic AI systems, categorizing agent and tool adaptations to improve performance, reliability, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As agentic AI systems expand in capability, systematic adaptation is crucial for enhancing performance and addressing complex tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a framework decomposing adaptations into agent and tool categories, further split into execution-signaled and output-signaled forms.

Result: The framework clarifies adaptation strategies, highlights trade-offs, and offers practical guidance for system design.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation and roadmap for developing more capable and reliable agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.

### [135] [Design and Evaluation of Cost-Aware PoQ for Decentralized LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16317)
*Arther Tian,Alex Ding,Frank Chen,Alan Wu,Aaron Chan,Bruce Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-aware Proof of Quality (PoQ) framework for decentralized LLM inference, balancing output quality and computational costs, and shows its effectiveness through experiments and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verification methods for decentralized LLM inference struggle to scale, and PoQ lacks consideration for heterogeneous computational costs. This work aims to integrate cost-awareness into PoQ to ensure sustainable and efficient decentralized inference.

Method: The proposed cost-aware PoQ framework combines ground truth token-level F1 scores, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT-based judgments within a unified pipeline. It uses a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost. Experiments involve five LLMs and three evaluator architectures.

Result: A semantic textual similarity bi-encoder correlates better with ground truth and GPT scores than cross-encoders, highlighting evaluator architecture's importance. Larger models prove more efficient in quality per unit latency. Simulations show the reward scheme favors high-quality, low-cost nodes.

Conclusion: Cost-aware PoQ offers a practical and economically sustainable approach to decentralized LLM inference, addressing scalability and efficiency challenges.

Abstract: Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models. Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.
  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.

*Peter Coveney,Roger Highfield*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current AI's limited impact outside niche successes, highlights its flaws like bias and lack of scientific rigor, and proposes 'Big AI'—a blend of theory and ML—for future progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite AI's hype, its practical impact is limited, and current models lack scientific rigor. The paper aims to address these gaps.

Method: The paper reviews AI's limitations (e.g., bias, parameter inefficiency) and proposes 'Big AI,' combining theory-based rigor with ML flexibility.

Result: Current AI models fail to capture scientific laws but opportunities exist in quantum AI and analogue computing.

Conclusion: A shift to 'Big AI'—merging theoretical foundations with ML—could unlock AI's transformative potential.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is commonly depicted as transformative. Yet, after more than a decade of hype, its measurable impact remains modest outside a few high-profile scientific and commercial successes. The 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics recognized AI's potential, but broader assessments indicate the impact to date is often more promotional than technical. We argue that while current AI may influence physics, physics has significantly more to offer this generation of AI. Current architectures - large language models, reasoning models, and agentic AI - can depend on trillions of meaningless parameters, suffer from distributional bias, lack uncertainty quantification, provide no mechanistic insights, and fail to capture even elementary scientific laws. We review critiques of these limits, highlight opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing, and lay down a roadmap for the adoption of 'Big AI': a synthesis of theory-based rigour with the flexibility of machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human behavior in constructing and selecting paths, the authors aim to develop an efficient optimization algorithm.

Method: PCIA mimics human path construction by generating random populations (particles representing paths) and intelligently mixing existing paths.

Result: PCIA was tested on 53 mathematical and 13 constrained optimization problems, showing high competitiveness against existing algorithms.

Conclusion: PCIA is a promising metaheuristic algorithm, demonstrating effectiveness across various optimization challenges.

Abstract: In this paper, a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm, called Path Construction Imitation Algorithm (PCIA), is proposed. PCIA is inspired by how humans construct new paths and use them. Typically, humans prefer popular transportation routes. In the event of a path closure, a new route is built by mixing the existing paths intelligently. Also, humans select different pathways on a random basis to reach unknown destinations. PCIA generates a random population to find the best route toward the destination, similar to swarm-based algorithms. Each particle represents a path toward the destination. PCIA has been tested with 53 mathematical optimization problems and 13 constrained optimization problems. The results showed that the PCIA is highly competitive compared to both popular and the latest metaheuristic algorithms.

Result: Synthelite achieves up to 95% success rates in strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks. It also demonstrates the ability to consider chemical feasibility during route design.

Conclusion: Synthelite serves as a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs orchestrate synthesis planning, integrating expert insights and ensuring chemical feasibility.

Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has long been envisioned as a complementary tool for synthetic chemists. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to allow interaction with human experts, limiting their ability to integrate chemists' insights. In this work, we introduce Synthelite, a synthesis planning framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to directly propose retrosynthetic transformations. Synthelite can generate end-to-end synthesis routes by harnessing the intrinsic chemical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while allowing expert intervention through natural language prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that Synthelite can flexibly adapt its planning trajectory to diverse user-specified constraints, achieving up to 95\% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks. Additionally, Synthelite exhibits the ability to account for chemical feasibility during route design. We envision Synthelite to be both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs are the central orchestrators of synthesis planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between raw time-series data and high-level decision-making in battery energy storage systems (BESS) using LLMs.

Method: TS2R uses segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation to encode temporal dynamics into natural language, enabling LLMs to generate structured reports.

Result: TS2R outperforms baseline methods in accuracy, robustness, and explainability, achieving expert-level decision quality without model retraining.

Conclusion: TS2R provides a practical solution for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence, demonstrating significant improvements in BESS management tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for interpreting multivariate time-series data, yet their application to real-world battery energy storage system (BESS) operation and maintenance remains largely unexplored. Here, we present TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a prompting framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series into structured, semantically enriched reports, enabling LLMs to reason, predict, and make decisions in BESS management scenarios. TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics. Notably, TS2R-integrated LLMs achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency without retraining or architecture modification, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence.

*Jinwu Chen,Qidie Wu,Bin Li,Lin Ma,Xin Si,Yang Hu,Shouyi Yin,Jun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: cuPilot is a multi-agent framework for optimizing CUDA kernels, improving performance over existing methods by introducing strategy coordination and achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing CUDA kernels is complex and requires expertise. Existing LLM-based methods lack performance due to poor agent design and mismatched evolution representations.

Method: cuPilot uses strategy-coordinated multi-agent optimization, including strategy-coordinated evolution, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization.

Result: Achieves 3.09x speedup over PyTorch on benchmarks and high hardware utilization on GEMM tasks.

Conclusion: cuPilot effectively addresses performance gaps in kernel optimization and is open-sourced for broader use.

Abstract: Optimizing CUDA kernels is a challenging and labor-intensive task, given the need for hardware-software co-design expertise and the proprietary nature of high-performance kernel libraries. While recent large language models (LLMs) combined with evolutionary algorithms show promise in automatic kernel optimization, existing approaches often fall short in performance due to their suboptimal agent designs and mismatched evolution representations. This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization. Experimental results show that the generated kernels by cuPilot achieve an average speed up of 3.09$\times$ over PyTorch on a benchmark of 100 kernels. On the GEMM tasks, cuPilot showcases sophisticated optimizations and achieves high utilization of critical hardware units. The generated kernels are open-sourced at https://github.com/champloo2878/cuPilot-Kernels.git.

*Danial Safaei,Siddartha Khastgir,Mohsen Alirezaei,Jeroen Ploeg,Son Tong,Xingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new metric for assessing whether autonomous vehicles base decisions on the same causal evidence in real and simulated environments, enhancing simulator calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fidelity measures focus on visual realism rather than causal evidence parity, limiting reliable transfer from simulation to reality.

Method: DFF uses explainable-AI (XAI) to identify and compare decisive features in real-synthetic pairs, proposing practical estimators and a calibration scheme.

Result: Experiments on 2126 matched pairs show DFF detects discrepancies missed by conventional methods and improves fidelity without compromising output value.

Conclusion: DFF effectively bridges the gap between visual fidelity and causal evidence parity, enhancing autonomous vehicle safety assurance.

Abstract: Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images "look real" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of centralized guidelines in meta-algorithmic research, which hampers scalability and validity due to scattered and evolving practices.

Method: Collect and synthesize good practices from the COSEAL community, covering research question formulation, experimental design, execution, and result analysis.

Result: Provides a comprehensive guideline for current state-of-the-art practices in meta-algorithmic research.

Conclusion: Establishes a unified resource to aid researchers and practitioners in conducting valid and scalable meta-algorithmic experiments.

Abstract: Empirical research on meta-algorithmics, such as algorithm selection, configuration, and scheduling, often relies on extensive and thus computationally expensive experiments. With the large degree of freedom we have over our experimental setup and design comes a plethora of possible error sources that threaten the scalability and validity of our scientific insights. Best practices for meta-algorithmic research exist, but they are scattered between different publications and fields, and continue to evolve separately from each other. In this report, we collect good practices for empirical meta-algorithmic research across the subfields of the COSEAL community, encompassing the entire experimental cycle: from formulating research questions and selecting an experimental design, to executing ex- periments, and ultimately, analyzing and presenting results impartially. It establishes the current state-of-the-art practices within meta-algorithmic research and serves as a guideline to both new researchers and practitioners in meta-algorithmic fields.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative art systems have high-dimensional parameter spaces with aesthetically compelling outputs in small regions, making manual exploration inefficient.

Conclusion: ParamExplorer addresses the challenge of exploring fragmented parameter spaces in generative art, enhancing discovery through interactive and automated methods.

Abstract: Generative art systems often involve high-dimensional and complex parameter spaces in which aesthetically compelling outputs occupy only small, fragmented regions. Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5.js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores computational scaling laws for CPU-only inference of large language and vision-language models on edge devices, revealing linear scaling with token length for language models and a resolution knee for vision-language models. Quantum-inspired compression significantly reduces resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance accuracy with computational and energy constraints on CPUs for deploying local large language and vision-language models, given the prevalence of CPUs in consumer hardware.

Method: Systematic benchmarking on two CPU tiers (MacBook Pro M2 and Raspberry Pi 5) using continuous sampling of processor/memory usage and area-under-curve integration to analyze computational load scaling.

Result: Found linear scaling with token length for language models and a resolution knee for vision-language models. Quantum-inspired compression reduces processor/memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy by up to 62%.

Conclusion: Provides systematic quantification of CPU-only scaling for local workloads, highlighting model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective for sustainable edge inference.

Abstract: Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs with memory enhance AI agents but introduce bias, especially in personalized interactions, as shown in recruitment simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore risks of bias in memory-enhanced personalized AI agents, a largely unexplored area.

Method: Simulated behavior of memory-enhanced agents in recruitment, analyzing bias introduction and amplification.

Result: Bias is systematically reinforced through personalization, even with safety-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: Additional protective measures are needed for memory-enhanced LLM-based agents to mitigate bias.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents with advanced capabilities for understanding, reasoning, and interacting across diverse tasks. The addition of memory further enhances them by enabling continuity across interactions, learning from past experiences, and improving the relevance of actions and responses over time; termed as memory-enhanced personalization. Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias. While several previous studies have highlighted bias in ML and LLMs, bias due to memory-enhanced personalized agents is largely unexplored. Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation. Our experiments on agents using safety-trained LLMs reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, emphasizing the need for additional protective measures or agent guardrails in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Needle in the Web,' a benchmark for evaluating LLMs and search agents on fuzzy exploratory queries, highlighting their current limitations in handling ambiguous and multifaceted searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on complex reasoning searches but overlook fuzzy exploratory search, where queries are vague and require identifying relevant webpages rather than factual answers. This gap necessitates a new benchmark to assess modern search systems.

Method: The authors developed 'Needle in the Web,' a benchmark with 663 questions across seven domains, using a flexible methodology to generate queries of controllable difficulty based on factual web content.

Result: Benchmarking three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems showed poor performance, with most models achieving below 35% accuracy. None consistently excelled across domains or difficulty levels.

Conclusion: The study reveals that current search systems struggle with fuzzy exploratory queries, emphasizing the need for improved retrieval and reasoning capabilities under semantic ambiguity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into sophisticated agents capable of automating complex real-world tasks, where browsing and reasoning over live web content is key to assessing retrieval and cognitive skills. Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost in safety-sensitive applications of large language models.

Method: Introduces Prefix Probing, which compares log-probabilities of 'agreement/execution' vs. 'refusal/safety' prefixes and uses prefix caching. Includes an algorithm for constructing highly informative prefixes.

Result: Achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream safety models with minimal computational cost and no extra model deployment.

Conclusion: Prefix Probing is practical and efficient for harmful content detection, offering a lightweight solution with high performance.

Abstract: Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

*Sri Yash Tadimalla,Justin Cary,Gordon Hull,Jordan Register,Daniel Maxwell,David Pugalee,Tina Heafner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy, emphasizing human agency and ethical reasoning over mere functional skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current educational frameworks inadequately address the literacy gap created by AI's rapid assimilation, focusing too narrowly on operational skills and neglecting critical and ethical reasoning.

Method: The paper introduces AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks to empower educators and students to make intentional, critical, and responsible choices about AI use.

Result: Proposed frameworks aim to foster human-centric approaches to AI, enabling stakeholders to articulate intentions and understand AI's societal impact.

Conclusion: True AI literacy requires teaching agency, critical thinking, and epistemology, positioning technology as a choice rather than an inevitability.

Abstract: The rapid assimilation of Artificial Intelligence technologies into various facets of society has created a significant educational imperative that current frameworks are failing to effectively address. We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.

TL;DR: The paper uses the Apriori algorithm to automate thematic grouping of hadith texts, revealing latent semantic relationships like rakaat-prayer and verse-revelation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for automating thematic grouping in Islamic texts due to increasing digitalization.

Method: Unsupervised learning with the Apriori algorithm is applied to preprocessed Indonesian hadith texts, using support, confidence, and lift parameters.

Result: Meaningful patterns (e.g., rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation) were identified, highlighting themes like worship and revelation.

Conclusion: The Apriori algorithm effectively uncovers semantic relationships, aiding digital Islamic studies and tech-based learning systems.

Abstract: This research stems from the urgency to automate the thematic grouping of hadith in line with the growing digitalization of Islamic texts. Based on a literature review, the unsupervised learning approach with the Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data. The dataset used is the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari, which first goes through preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration. These findings demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm has the ability to automatically uncover latent semantic relationships, while contributing to the development of digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems.

TL;DR: Comparison of single-agent vs. multi-agent pipelines for geometry problem solving shows multi-agent benefits open-source models, while proprietary models fare better single-agent on classic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the effectiveness of multi-agent designs over single-agent in solving diagram-grounded geometry problems using multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

Method: Systematic comparison of single-agent and multi-agent pipelines across four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math, using open-source (Qwen-2.5-VL) and closed-source (Gemini-2.0-Flash) models.

Result: Multi-agent improves performance for open-source models (e.g., Qwen-2.5-VL gains +6.8 points on Geometry3K), while proprietary models perform better single-agent on classic benchmarks. Modest multi-agent gains seen for newer datasets (We-Math).

Conclusion: Multi-agent pipelines benefit open-source models and assist strong proprietary systems on newer benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

Abstract: Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

*Giovanni Adorni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cyber Humanism in Education to address the impact of GenAI on education, emphasizing human agency and proposing a framework with three pillars. Case studies highlight its application and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professionalization of teachers due to GenAI's influence on education.

Method: The paper proposes Cyber Humanism in Education as a framework, focusing on reflexive competence, algorithmic citizenship, and dialogic design. It includes higher-education case studies using prompt-based learning and a Conversational AI Educator certification.

Result: Findings show strengthened epistemic agency but also highlight tensions around workload, equity, and governance in AI-rich educational environments.

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests the need for human-centered approaches in AI-integrated education, balancing innovation with ethical and practical considerations.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping how knowledge is produced and validated in education. Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures.
  We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \emph{reflexive competence}, \emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the inherent constraints on algorithmic intelligence by examining formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability.

Method: The authors formalize these two computational limitations and demonstrate their combined impact on an agent's reasoning and predictive abilities.

Result: They find that these limits prevent an algorithmic agent from computing its own maximal prediction horizon, revealing trade-offs in intelligent systems.

Conclusion: The paper highlights structural bounds on reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in algorithmic agents, clarifying fundamental limitations.

Abstract: We formalize two independent computational limitations that constrain algorithmic intelligence: formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability. The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the later bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot compute its own maximal prediction horizon generally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems.

Result: Theoretical guarantees of soundness, completeness, and convergence are provided. Empirical results show the method's scope, efficiency, and accuracy across multiple BBAI systems.

Conclusion: PDDL-style representations and Monte-Carlo tree search offer an effective approach to modeling and interpreting the planning capabilities of black-box AI systems.

Abstract: Black-box AI (BBAI) systems such as foundational models are increasingly being used for sequential decision making. To ensure that such systems are safe to operate and deploy, it is imperative to develop efficient methods that can provide a sound and interpretable representation of the BBAI's capabilities. This paper shows that PDDL-style representations can be used to efficiently learn and model an input BBAI's planning capabilities. It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities. Theoretical results show soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems illustrate the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of the presented methods.

TL;DR: A hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline predicts lung cancer patients' pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours using structured and unstructured EHR data, improving sensitivity and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer patients often suffer from breakthrough pain, requiring timely intervention. Proactive pain management can enhance treatment precision and resource allocation.

Method: Analyzed a retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients using structured (demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, analgesics) and unstructured (clinical notes) EHR data. Combined ML for temporal trends and LLM for interpreting ambiguous records.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with sensitivity improvements of 8.6% and 10.4% due to LLM augmentation.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach provides a clinically interpretable, scalable tool for early pain episode prediction, potentially improving oncology care.

Abstract: Lung cancer patients frequently experience breakthrough pain episodes, with up to 91% requiring timely intervention. To enable proactive pain management, we propose a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline that predicts pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization using both structured and unstructured electronic health record data. A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model. This hybrid approach offers a clinically interpretable and scalable tool for early pain episode forecasting, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation in oncology care.

*Siqi Wang,Chao Liang,Yunfan Gao,Erxin Yu,Sen Li,Yushi Li,Jing Li,Haofen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CitySeeker, a benchmark to evaluate VLMs' spatial reasoning for navigating implicit human needs in urban settings, revealing low task completion rates (21.1%) due to reasoning and spatial cognition issues. Proposed strategies (BCR) aim to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with interpreting implicit human needs (e.g., 'I am thirsty') in urban navigation, despite advances in explicit instruction-based tasks.

Method: CitySeeker benchmark with 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities evaluates VLMs' capabilities. Exploratory strategies (Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, Memory-Based Retrieval) are proposed to address bottlenecks.

Result: Top-performing VLMs achieve only 21.1% task completion, hindered by long-horizon reasoning errors, poor spatial cognition, and weak experiential recall.

Conclusion: The study highlights VLMs' limitations in implicit navigation and offers actionable insights (BCR strategies) to enhance spatial intelligence for 'last-mile' challenges.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in explicit instruction-based navigation; however, their ability to interpret implicit human needs (e.g., "I am thirsty") in dynamic urban environments remains underexplored. This paper introduces CitySeeker, a novel benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making capabilities for exploring embodied urban navigation to address implicit needs. CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling "last-mile" navigation challenges.

TL;DR: DiscoverDCP integrates symbolic regression with DCP rules to create globally convex models without post-hoc verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenge of verifying convexity post-hoc and improve model flexibility and accuracy.

Method: Combines symbolic regression with DCP rule sets to ensure discovered expressions are convex by construction.

Result: Produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: DiscoverDCP efficiently generates convex surrogates with relaxed and accurate functional forms.

Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.

TL;DR: A hybrid ensemble framework combines quantum sentiment analysis and diverse architectures to achieve 60.14% accuracy in financial market prediction, outperforming individual models and prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial market prediction is challenging due to high noise and non-stationarity. Small accuracy improvements can yield significant value.

Method: A hybrid ensemble framework integrates quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer, and strategic model selection. It combines diverse algorithms and filters weak predictors.

Result: Achieves 60.14% accuracy (3.10% improvement) on S&P 500 prediction, with statistical significance (p<0.05). Backtesting shows a Sharpe ratio of 1.2.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the value of architecture diversity and quantum-enhanced sentiment analysis, offering practical trading potential.

Abstract: Financial market prediction is a challenging application of machine learning, where even small improvements in directional accuracy can yield substantial value. Most models struggle to exceed 55--57\% accuracy due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency. We introduce a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection, achieving 60.14\% directional accuracy on S\&P 500 prediction, a 3.10\% improvement over individual models.
  Our framework addresses three limitations of prior approaches. First, architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity: combining different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the same data outperforms training identical architectures on multiple datasets (60.14\% vs.\ 52.80\%), confirmed by correlation analysis ($r>0.6$ among same-architecture models). Second, a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit enhances sentiment analysis, providing +0.8\% to +1.5\% gains per model. Third, smart filtering excludes weak predictors (accuracy $<52\%$), improving ensemble performance (Top-7 models: 60.14\% vs.\ all 35 models: 51.2\%).
  We evaluate on 2020--2023 market data across seven instruments, covering diverse regimes including the COVID-19 crash and inflation-driven correction. McNemar's test confirms statistical significance ($p<0.05$). Preliminary backtesting with confidence-based filtering (6+ model consensus) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8, demonstrating practical trading potential.

*Wei Guan,Jian Cao,Jinyu Cai,Qiqi Cai,Jianqi Gao,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLOW is a new framework combining GNNs and LLMs to predict Agentic Workflow (AW) performance, addressing limitations of existing methods by capturing both topological dependencies and semantic logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation for AWs limit scalability, and current prediction methods fail to capture both topological and semantic aspects effectively.

Method: GLOW integrates GNNs for graph-structure modeling and LLMs for semantic reasoning, using a graph-oriented LLM instruction-tuned on graph tasks. Features from both are fused, with contrastive alignment refining the latent space.

Result: GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility on FLORA-Bench.

Conclusion: GLOW provides a scalable and accurate solution for AW performance prediction by unifying structural and semantic modeling.

Abstract: Agentic Workflows (AWs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, the scalability of automating their generation is severely constrained by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation. Existing AW performance prediction methods act as surrogates but fail to simultaneously capture the intricate topological dependencies and the deep semantic logic embedded in AWs. To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.

*Jeff Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KANs face memory constraints due to bandwidth demands of their basis functions. Vision KANs' holographic topology makes traditional pruning ineffective. SHARe-KAN uses vector quantization and hardware-aware compilation to reduce memory usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the memory constraints of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), particularly the high bandwidth demands of their learned basis functions, which hinder deployment in memory-constrained environments.

Method: The authors introduce SHARe-KAN, which employs Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to exploit functional redundancy. This is combined with LUTHAM, a hardware-aware compiler for static memory planning.

Result: The framework achieves an 88x reduction in runtime memory (from 1.13 GB to 12.91 MB) while matching the uncompressed baseline accuracy on PASCAL VOC. It also ensures high L2 cache residency (>90%) on NVIDIA Ampere architecture.

Conclusion: SHARe-KAN effectively addresses the memory wall problem of KANs by leveraging vector quantization and hardware-aware compilation, decoupling the workload from DRAM bandwidth constraints and enabling deployment in memory-constrained environments.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) face a fundamental memory wall: their learned basis functions create parameter counts that impose extreme bandwidth demands, hindering deployment in memory-constrained environments. We show that Vision KANs exhibit a holographic topology, where information is distributed across the interference of splines rather than localized to specific edges. Consequently, traditional pruning fails (10% sparsity degrades mAP from 85.23% to 45%, a $\sim$40-point drop). To address this, we present SHARe-KAN, a framework utilizing Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to exploit functional redundancy while preserving the dense topology. Coupled with LUTHAM, a hardware-aware compiler with static memory planning, we achieve $88\times$ runtime memory reduction (1.13 GB $\to$ 12.91 MB) and match uncompressed baseline accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Profiling on NVIDIA Ampere architecture confirms $>90\%$ L2 cache residency, demonstrating that the workload is decoupled from DRAM bandwidth constraints inherent to spline-based architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the roles of low- and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation tasks, proving their equivalence and introducing methods to optimize GNN performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the unclear roles of low- and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation tasks and improve GNN effectiveness.

Method: Introduces a frequency signal scaler and a space flip method to enhance graph signal handling and embedding expressiveness.

Result: Demonstrates that either low- or high-frequency signals suffice for recommendations, validated on four datasets.

Conclusion: Proposes scalable methods to optimize graph signal filtering and embedding, improving recommendation performance.

Abstract: Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective in modeling graph signals, with their success in recommendation often attributed to low-pass filtering. However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/mojosey/SimGCF.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a new paradigm for deploying frontier-scale language models without costly training from scratch by leveraging knowledge inheritance and efficiency-aware design.

Method: A novel 3-phase block-level WSD training scheme: warm-up (progressive block-size increase), stable (full-sequence diffusion), and decay (reverting to compact blocks). Post-training alignment uses SFT and DPO.

Result: Developed LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), instruction-tuned MoE variants optimized for deployment, offering superior performance and efficiency through parallel decoding.

Conclusion: LLaDA2.0 successfully converts AR models into efficient dLLMs, preserving parallel decoding benefits and achieving scalable deployment at the frontier scale.

Abstract: This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.

TL;DR: A Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method improves crop yield and resource efficiency by optimizing water-nitrogen combinations and dynamically regulating stress signals, validated by field experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with optimizing water-nitrogen combinations and quantifying stress signals, leading to poor yield and resource efficiency.

Method: Proposes NDRL with a parent agent for macroscopic actions and a child agent incorporating stress factors for daily optimization, validated using DSSAT simulations.

Result: Simulated yield increased by 4.7%, irrigation water productivity by 5.6% and 5.1%, and nitrogen partial factor productivity by 6.3% and 1.0% in 2023 and 2024.

Conclusion: NDRL addresses complexity and precision in agricultural resource management, supporting sustainable development.

Abstract: Effective irrigation and nitrogen fertilization have a significant impact on crop yield. However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively. Our method advances the development of cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, providing new ideas for addressing the complexity and precision issues in agricultural resource management and for sustainable agricultural development.

*Reza T. Batley,Sourav Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Janus is a generative-predictive framework for inverse design of heterogeneous materials, combining deep learning with physics-informed bias for accurate and efficient inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational challenges and ill-posed nature of inverse design in heterogeneous material microstructures.

Method: Couples a deep encoder-decoder with a predictive KHRONOS head, learning a disentangled latent space for both generation and prediction.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate property prediction (R²=0.98), and efficient inverse solutions with low error (1%).

Conclusion: Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse design with reduced computational cost compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\% relative error) and sub-5\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches.

Method: SLHF decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem for the Leader, enabling iterative refinement during inference.

Result: SLHF demonstrates strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales effectively, and allows transferable inference-time refinements without additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SLHF outperforms RLHF and NLHF in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness, offering a promising framework for preference optimization.

Abstract: We introduce Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a new framework for preference optimization. SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.

*Javon Hickmon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D3G improves zero-shot image classification accuracy and reduces bias by generating diverse demographic data using CLIP and Stable Diffusion XL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of underfitting and demographic bias in fine-grained image classification, the paper explores solutions without additional training.

Method: Proposes D3G, a training-free zero-shot method combining CLIP and Stable Diffusion XL to generate diverse demographic data for inference.

Result: Diverse demographic data boosts accuracy and reduces bias in pre-trained models, with insights into demographic impacts.

Conclusion: D3G effectively enhances classification fairness and performance by leveraging generative models for demographic diversity.

Abstract: Image classification is a task essential for machine perception to achieve human-level image understanding. Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric.

### [168] [Surely Large Multimodal Models (Don't) Excel in Visual Species Recognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15748)
*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) outperform Few-Shot Learning (FSL) expert models in Visual Species Recognition (VSR). Surprisingly, LMMs struggle despite prompting techniques but can correct FSL errors. The proposed Post-hoc Correction (POC) method improves accuracy by +6.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled data in VSR motivates training FSL expert models. The paper investigates if advanced LMMs, despite their general recognition prowess, can outperform FSL models in specialized VSR tasks.

Method: The authors propose POC, a method where LMMs re-rank FSL expert model predictions using enriched prompts (softmax scores and few-shot examples). No extra training or validation is needed.

Result: POC outperforms prior FSL methods by +6.4% across five VSR benchmarks. It generalizes to various backbones and LMMs, enhancing FSL methods without manual intervention.

Conclusion: LMMs struggle standalone in VSR but excel correcting FSL mistakes. POC is a simple, effective plug-and-play solution to boost FSL performance.

Abstract: Visual Species Recognition (VSR) is pivotal to biodiversity assessment and conservation, evolution research, and ecology and ecosystem management. Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods.

### [169] [A Special Case of Quadratic Extrapolation Under the Neural Tangent Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15749)
*Abiel Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores ReLU MLP's linear extrapolation for out-of-distribution points, focusing on the NTK regime's unique behavior at the origin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the extrapolation behavior of ReLU MLPs under the NTK regime, especially near the origin, which is distinct from far points due to non-translational invariance.

Method: Analyzes the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the NTK, emphasizing rotational invariance and the unique case of extrapolation near the origin.

Result: Discovery of quadratic extrapolation behavior for points close to the origin, differing from the linear extrapolation observed for far points.

Conclusion: The study highlights the nuanced extrapolation bounds of ReLU NTK, revealing quadratic behavior near the origin as a key finding.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that the ReLU MLP tends to extrapolate linearly for an out-of-distribution evaluation point. The machine learning literature provides ample analysis with respect to the mechanisms to which linearity is induced. However, the analysis of extrapolation at the origin under the NTK regime remains a more unexplored special case. In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation. Ultimately, it is this loose recognition of the two special cases of extrapolation that motivate the discovery of quadratic extrapolation for an evaluation close to the origin.

*Zihao Wang,Wei Peng,Junming Zhang,Jian Li,Wenxin Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAO-Net is a two-stage network for encrypted traffic classification, effectively handling both known and unknown traffic types with high accuracy and fine-grained classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic due to predefined categories. TAO-Net addresses this by enabling accurate and flexible classification of emerging applications.

Method: TAO-Net uses a hybrid OOD detection mechanism (transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis) in Stage 1 and large language models with semantic-enhanced prompts in Stage 2 for fine-grained OOD classification.

Result: TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, significantly outperforming previous methods (44.73-86.30%) in identifying emerging applications.

Conclusion: TAO-Net demonstrates superior performance in encrypted traffic classification, particularly for OOD traffic, offering a flexible and accurate solution.

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification aims to identify applications or services by analyzing network traffic data. One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single "Other" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.

TL;DR: Novel use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) improves interpretability of complex data with two visualization tools: PKAN for pairwise nonlinear associations and MKAN for multivariate feature contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in interpreting high-dimensional, collinear datasets beyond traditional correlation methods.

Method: Introduces PKAN (Pairwise KAN Matrix) for nonlinear pairwise associations and MKAN (Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix) for feature ranking.

Result: PKAN and MKAN outperform Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information in robustness and informativeness.

Conclusion: KAN-based tools enhance interpretability and uncover hidden patterns, aiding domain-informed model development.

Abstract: Interpreting complex datasets remains a major challenge for scientists, particularly due to high dimensionality and collinearity among variables. We introduce a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance interpretability and parsimony beyond what traditional correlation analyses offer. We present two interpretable, color-coded visualization tools: the Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) and the Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN). PKAN characterizes nonlinear associations between pairs of variables, while MKAN serves as a nonlinear feature-ranking tool that quantifies the relative contributions of inputs in predicting a target variable. These tools support pre-processing (e.g., feature selection, redundancy analysis) and post-processing (e.g., model explanation, physical insights) in model development workflows. Through experimental comparisons, we demonstrate that PKAN and MKAN yield more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information. By capturing the strength and functional forms of relationships, these matrices facilitate the discovery of hidden physical patterns and promote domain-informed model development.

*Yoonpyo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReactorFold is a generative framework that uses language models to design nuclear reactor cores, autonomously adjusting designs and discovering high-performing asymmetric configurations beyond human-imposed constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for nuclear reactor core design are limited by fixed, human-defined spaces, preventing discovery of novel topologies. This paper aims to overcome this by leveraging language models.

Method: ReactorFold reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem, using Monte Carlo data, fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate layouts in a single forward pass.

Result: The model autonomously adjusts gadolinium rod inventory and discovers asymmetric configurations, surpassing conventional methods and demonstrating emergent design-space expansion.

Conclusion: Language models can internalize physical relationships and transcend human design constraints, enabling discovery of novel, high-performing nuclear reactor core designs.

Abstract: Designing nuclear reactor cores requires navigating large discrete design spaces governed by complex neutronic interactions. Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel multi-view learning model, TMvRKM, enhances computational efficiency and classification by integrating kernel machines with multi-view frameworks, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-view SVM approaches struggle with high-dimensional decision boundaries and view inconsistencies, prompting the development of TMvRKM.

Method: TMvRKM uses a regularized least squares approach instead of QPPs, incorporates coupling terms for error balance, and combines early and late fusion strategies.

Result: TMvRKM outperforms baseline models on benchmark datasets like UCI, KEEL, and AwA, showing superior generalization performance.

Conclusion: TMvRKM effectively addresses computational and generalization challenges in multi-view learning, offering a robust alternative to traditional kernel-based methods.

Abstract: Multi-view learning (MVL) is an emerging field in machine learning that focuses on improving generalization performance by leveraging complementary information from multiple perspectives or views. Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets. Both experimental results and statistical analyses consistently highlight its exceptional generalization performance, outperforming baseline models in every scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow convergence and privacy-utility tradeoffs in federated learning under non-IID data by leveraging domain knowledge constraints.

Method: Introduces Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), incorporating domain knowledge into optimization, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: SCFA reduces data heterogeneity by 41%, improves privacy-utility tradeoffs by 2.7x, and achieves 22% faster convergence with lower model divergence.

Conclusion: SCFA's constraint-based approach effectively enhances federated learning performance, validated empirically and theoretically.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed data sources but suffers from slow convergence under non-IID data conditions. Existing solutions employ algorithmic modifications treating all client updates identically, ignoring semantic validity. We introduce Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a theoretically-grounded framework incorporating domain knowledge constraints into distributed optimization. We prove SCFA achieves convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho) where rho represents constraint violation rate, establishing the first convergence theory for constraint-based federated learning. Our analysis shows constraints reduce effective data heterogeneity by 41% and improve privacy-utility tradeoffs through hypothesis space reduction by factor theta=0.37. Under (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy with epsilon=10, constraint regularization maintains utility within 3.7% of non-private baseline versus 12.1% degradation for standard federated learning, representing 2.7x improvement. We validate our framework on manufacturing predictive maintenance using Bosch production data with 1.18 million samples and 968 sensor features, constructing knowledge graphs encoding 3,000 constraints from ISA-95 and MASON ontologies. Experiments demonstrate 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction, and constraint violation thresholds where rho<0.05 maintains 90% optimal performance while rho>0.18 causes catastrophic failure. Our theoretical predictions match empirical observations with R^2>0.90 across convergence, privacy, and violation-performance relationships.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning, enabling the discovery of compact, interpretable physical laws from experimental data.

Method: The method involves transforming experimental data into dimensionless groups using neural networks, with regularization to ensure simple, interpretable coefficients.

Result: The approach effectively handles measurement noise and discrete sampling, discovering accurate and physically meaningful laws, even with multiple dimensionless numbers.

Conclusion: While promising, challenges like computational cost and automation remain, but the tutorial provides guidance for applying dimensionless learning to experimental datasets.

Abstract: Dimensionless learning is a data-driven framework for discovering dimensionless numbers and scaling laws from experimental measurements. This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists. This tutorial serves as both an educational resource and a practical guide for researchers seeking to apply dimensionless learning to their experimental data.

TL;DR: An interpretable machine learning framework is introduced to assess thrombosis risk in rotary blood pumps using CFD-derived flow features, achieving accurate predictions with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational models lack reliability and interpretability in predicting thrombosis risk due to complex flow conditions in rotary blood pumps.

Method: A logistic regression model with structured feature selection is trained on spatial risk patterns from validated thrombosis models for interpretable feature sets.

Result: The model reproduces labeled risk distributions, identifies key flow features linked to thrombosis, and predicts risk regions in centrifugal pumps despite limited training data.

Conclusion: Interpretable machine learning can efficiently link flow features to thrombosis risk, aiding CFD-driven device design and thrombogenicity screening.

Abstract: Thrombosis in rotary blood pumps arises from complex flow conditions that remain difficult to translate into reliable and interpretable risk predictions using existing computational models. This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate intraoperative hypotension prediction is challenging due to patient variability and rare events.

Method: CSA-TTA uses cross-sample augmentation, K-Shape clustering, and similarity retrieval for test-time adaptation, combined with self-supervised signals.

Result: CSA-TTA boosts Recall by +1.33% (fine-tuning) and +7.46% (zero-shot), and F1 by +1.13% and +5.07% on VitalDB.

Conclusion: CSA-TTA enhances robustness and generalization in IOH prediction, validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) poses significant surgical risks, but accurate prediction remains challenging due to patient-specific variability. While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data is a key asset for LLMs, but evaluating its contribution fairly and efficiently is challenging, especially for large datasets. Traditional methods are computationally expensive.

Method: The paper leverages the mathematical structure of DPO to simplify Shapley value computation, avoiding the need for numerous model retrainings.

Result: The proposed method enables scalable and efficient Shapley value computation, making data valuation practical for large LLMs.

Conclusion: This approach opens new possibilities for fair resource pooling and informed data investment decisions in LLM training.

Abstract: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid twin approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model discrepancies (ignorance) in physics-based simulations, reducing data requirements while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-based models often fail to fully capture reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifications, and purely data-driven methods require impractical amounts of high-quality data. Addressing this gap efficiently is crucial.

Method: A hybrid twin approach combines physics-based models with GNNs to learn the ignorance component. GNNs handle sparse spatial data effectively, capturing missing physics patterns without dense measurements.

Result: The GNN-based hybrid twin successfully models ignorance in nonlinear heat transfer problems, generalizing across meshes, geometries, and load positions, enhancing simulation accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The hybrid twin with GNNs offers a practical solution to improve physics-based simulations by leveraging sparse data, bridging the gap between models and reality efficiently.

Abstract: Simulating complex unsteady physical phenomena relies on detailed mathematical models, simulated for instance by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of PINNs in handling complex boundary conditions and achieving high accuracy in solving PDEs.

Method: Extends the TENG framework by integrating natural gradient optimization with Euler and Heun time-stepping schemes, incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function.

Result: Demonstrates superior accuracy with the Heun method and computational efficiency with the Euler method for simpler cases.

Conclusion: Sets a foundation for extending the framework to other boundary conditions and PDEs, enhancing neural network-based solvers' practicality.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.

TL;DR: TS-DP, a novel framework, enhances Diffusion Policy by reducing inference latency and computational cost through speculative decoding and RL-based scheduling, achieving faster inference without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Policy suffers from high inference latency and computational costs in dynamic embodied tasks, necessitating adaptive solutions beyond static acceleration methods.

Method: TS-DP introduces a Transformer-based drafter to replace costly denoising calls and uses an RL-based scheduler to dynamically adjust parameters based on task difficulty.

Result: TS-DP achieves up to 4.17x faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching 25 Hz frequency and enabling real-time control.

Conclusion: TS-DP successfully addresses the challenges of dynamic embodied tasks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for real-time diffusion-based control.

Abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) excels in embodied control but suffers from high inference latency and computational cost due to multiple iterative denoising steps. The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.

*Avais Jan,Prakash Chourasia,Sarwan Ali,Murray Patterson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates nine kernel functions for t-SNE in analyzing biological sequences, finding cosine similarity outperforms others in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of Gaussian and isolation kernels in t-SNE for categorical biological sequences.

Method: Evaluated nine kernels with three embedding methods (One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, minimizers) using visualization and neighborhood preservation metrics.

Result: Cosine similarity kernel excelled in runtime, distance preservation, and downstream tasks across six datasets.

Conclusion: Cosine similarity is optimal for large-scale biological sequence analysis, enhancing both visualization and analytical performance.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional biological sequencing data. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is widely used for this purpose, traditionally employing the Gaussian kernel to compute pairwise similarities. However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. Our results show that kernel selection significantly impacts not only visualization quality but also downstream analytical tasks, with the cosine similarity kernel providing the most robust performance across different data types and embedding strategies, making it particularly suitable for large-scale biological sequence analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper unifies three discrete sequence diffusion methods under the Wright-Fisher population genetics model, enabling stable simplicial diffusion and flexible domain switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disparate algorithms and trade-offs of discrete, Gaussian, and simplicial diffusion methods by unifying them under a single framework.

Method: The authors build a theory connecting the three methods as parameterizations of the Wright-Fisher model, identifying simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as large-population limits.

Result: Their Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous models in conditional DNA generation, while also supporting multi-domain training.

Conclusion: The unified framework allows flexible domain switching and improves performance, leveraging population genetics theory for stable simplicial diffusion.

Abstract: To model discrete sequences such as DNA, proteins, and language using diffusion, practitioners must choose between three major methods: diffusion in discrete space, Gaussian diffusion in Euclidean space, or diffusion on the simplex. Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain.

*Lucas Monteiro Paes,Nivedha Sivakumar,Yinong Oliver Wang,Masha Fedzechkina Donaldson,Luca Zappella,Nicholas Apostoloff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Direct Steering Optimization (DSO), a method to reduce bias in generative models like VLMs and LLMs while maintaining performance, using reinforcement learning for activation steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of bias in decisions made by generative models, such as VLMs, which can lead to unfair outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Users need methods to control bias reduction without sacrificing model performance.

Method: The authors propose DSO, a reinforcement learning-based approach to find linear transformations for steering activations, specifically designed to mitigate bias while allowing control over model capabilities.

Result: DSO achieves a state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and performance in both VLMs and LLMs, offering practitioners control over this balance during inference.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that directly optimizing steering strategies for behavior control is more effective than heuristic-based methods, providing better bias intervention in generative models.

Abstract: Generative models are often deployed to make decisions on behalf of users, such as vision-language models (VLMs) identifying which person in a room is a doctor to help visually impaired individuals. Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of fungal DNA barcode classification, where sparse labeling and long-tailed taxa distributions hinder conventional supervised methods.

Method: Introduces BarcodeMamba+, a state-space model architecture, utilizing pretraining on partially labelled data and fine-tuning with hierarchical label smoothing, weighted loss, and multi-head output layers.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods across taxonomic levels on a challenging fungal benchmark, demonstrating significant performance gains from each enhancement.

Conclusion: BarcodeMamba+ provides a scalable and effective tool for fungal taxonomy classification, advancing genomics-based biodiversity research.

Abstract: Accurate taxonomic classification from DNA barcodes is a cornerstone of global biodiversity monitoring, yet fungi present extreme challenges due to sparse labelling and long-tailed taxa distributions. Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels. Our work provides a powerful new tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and establishes an effective and scalable training paradigm for this challenging domain.

Motivation: Understanding how Transformers utilize unlabeled contextual demonstrations for robust representation learning.

Method: Introduce IC-SSL, combining labeled and unlabeled examples to train Transformers for context-dependent representations.

Result: Demonstrates improved prediction accuracy in low-label regimes by exploiting unlabeled context.

Conclusion: Transformers effectively leverage unlabeled data within the ICL framework, enhancing performance with sparse labels.

Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in understanding the capacity of Transformers for in-context learning (ICL), yet most theory focuses on supervised settings with explicitly labeled pairs. In practice, Transformers often perform well even when labels are sparse or absent, suggesting crucial structure within unlabeled contextual demonstrations. We introduce and study in-context semi-supervised learning (IC-SSL), where a small set of labeled examples is accompanied by many unlabeled points, and show that Transformers can leverage the unlabeled context to learn a robust, context-dependent representation. This representation enables accurate predictions and markedly improves performance in low-label regimes, offering foundational insights into how Transformers exploit unlabeled context for representation learning within the ICL framework.

Motivation: To address the difficulty of interpreting and controlling deep neural networks by bridging mechanistic interpretability and model editing.

Method: Uses an $ℓ_1$-regularized autoencoder to learn sparse features, validates them with Grad-FAM, and performs weight-space interventions for precise control.

Result: Demonstrates interpretable control over ResNet-18 and ViT-B/16 models, with a derived critical suppression threshold ($α_{crit}$) for robustness diagnostics.

Conclusion: SALVE provides a principled way to turn feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing transparent and controllable AI systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve impressive performance but remain difficult to interpret and control. We present SALVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing), a unified "discover, validate, and control" framework that bridges mechanistic interpretability and model editing. Using an $\ell_1$-regularized autoencoder, we learn a sparse, model-native feature basis without supervision. We validate these features with Grad-FAM, a feature-level saliency mapping method that visually grounds latent features in input data. Leveraging the autoencoder's structure, we perform precise and permanent weight-space interventions, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features. We further derive a critical suppression threshold, $α_{crit}$, quantifying each class's reliance on its dominant feature, supporting fine-grained robustness diagnostics. Our approach is validated on both convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, demonstrating consistent, interpretable control over their behavior. This work contributes a principled methodology for turning feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing the development of transparent and controllable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of efficient AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine by automating model conversion and optimizing full neural network execution.

Method: Uses a structured parallelization method for scaling across the AIE-ML fabric, employs a graph placement and search algorithm for topology-optimized placements, and supports quantized models from high-level tools.

Result: Achieves 98.6% efficiency in layer scaling benchmarks, utilizing 97.4% of AIE tiles, and delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints.

Conclusion: AIE4ML is a practical solution for ultra-low-latency environments, such as particle physics trigger systems.

Abstract: Efficient AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine (AIE) is challenging due to tightly coupled VLIW execution, explicit datapaths, and local memory management. Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness. In layer scaling benchmarks, we achieve up to 98.6% efficiency relative to the single-kernel baseline, utilizing 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) of the device with entirely on-chip data movement. With evaluations across real-world model topologies, we demonstrate that AIE4ML delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints, making it a practical companion for ultra-low-latency environments such as trigger systems in particle physics experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decision-tree studies often use predictors that fall under regulated data categories, highlighting the need for privacy-preserving methods in machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how often decision-tree studies use predictors that are regulated by privacy laws, as a proxy for real-world use of such data.

Method: Compiled a corpus of decision-tree papers, categorized reported predictors into regulated data types (e.g., health data, biometric identifiers), and linked these to EU and US privacy laws.

Result: Many predictors in studies are regulated, with healthcare being the most affected. Differences across industries and temporal trends were observed.

Conclusion: The findings advocate for privacy-preserving methods and governance checks in machine learning, extending beyond decision trees.

Abstract: Decision-tree methods are widely used on structured tabular data and are valued for interpretability across many sectors. However, published studies often list the predictors they use (for example age, diagnosis codes, location). Privacy laws increasingly regulate such data types. We use published decision-tree papers as a proxy for real-world use of legally governed data. We compile a corpus of decision-tree studies and assign each reported predictor to a regulated data category (for example health data, biometric identifiers, children's data, financial attributes, location traces, and government IDs). We then link each category to specific excerpts in European Union and United States privacy laws. We find that many reported predictors fall into regulated categories, with the largest shares in healthcare and clear differences across industries. We analyze prevalence, industry composition, and temporal patterns, and summarize regulation-aligned timing using each framework's reference year. Our evidence supports privacy-preserving methods and governance checks, and can inform ML practice beyond decision trees.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-effective, scalable RFID-based method for tracking assets in forests without needing known tag locations, achieving GPS-like accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RFID systems struggle with tag localization in forests due to signal issues, and existing methods require known tag locations. This work addresses scenarios where such locations are unavailable.

Method: The proposed method employs Gaussian Processes to model environments using RF signals alone, without GPS or cameras, and uses a weighted log-likelihood approach to match unknown RF signals to modeled environments.

Result: The method achieves GPS-level localization accuracy using passive RFID, enabling simultaneous tracking of multiple wildfire assets without prior tag positioning.

Conclusion: This approach offers a low-cost, scalable alternative to GPS for asset tracking in forested areas, especially useful for wildfire response.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, cost-effective, and scalable approach to track numerous assets distributed in forested environments using commodity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) targeting wildfire response applications. Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS.

TL;DR: DR-RL dynamically optimizes low-rank factorization in MHSA using RL and matrix perturbation theory, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional low-rank approximations lack flexibility; DR-RL adapts rank dynamically based on context, layer sensitivities, and hardware.

Method: Uses an RL agent for sequential rank selection, online matrix perturbation bounds for updates, and lightweight Transformer policy with batched SVD for scalability.

Result: Maintains full-rank accuracy while reducing FLOPs, especially for long sequences (L > 4096).

Conclusion: DR-RL provides adaptive efficiency with theoretical rigor, improving on heuristic rank reduction in resource-constrained LLMs.

Abstract: We propose Dynamic Rank Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL), a novel framework that adaptively optimizes the low-rank factorization of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of reinforcement learning and online matrix perturbation theory. While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the challenge of recovering overcomplete features in superposition from noisy black-box queries, proposing an efficient algorithm for feature identification and function reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the difficulty of recovering features in superposition, a common scenario where models encode features linearly but they are entangled, making recovery challenging.

Method: The authors develop a query algorithm that refines search in Fourier space iteratively to locate hidden feature directions $v_i$ and reconstruct $f$, even with noisy access.

Result: The algorithm successfully identifies non-degenerate feature directions and reconstructs $f$, outperforming prior methods by handling arbitrary superpositions and general response functions.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances the field by efficiently solving feature recovery in superposition under more general conditions than previous approaches, opening new avenues for research.

Abstract: It is widely believed that complex machine learning models generally encode features through linear representations, but these features exist in superposition, making them challenging to recover. We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \[ f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\,σ_i(v_i^\top x), \] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $σ_i:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.
  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \neq j$, and general response functions $σ_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degradation of predictive power in reduced-order models (ROMs) for PDEs over long time horizons.

Method: Introduces a flexible high-order finite-difference scheme and a Rollout loss for training ROMs to maintain accuracy over arbitrary time spans.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on the 2D Burgers equation.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances ROM performance for long-term predictions in PDEs.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Method: The problem is framed as discrete black-box optimization, evaluating performance via validation perplexity for each optimizer.

Result: Amortized optimizers (PABBO, SABBO) outperform hand-designed methods (GA, ES) in efficiency, often finding near-optimal solutions faster.

Conclusion: Learned, amortized optimizers are more efficient than traditional evolutionary methods for topic number selection in LDA.

Abstract: Choosing the number of topics $T$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a key design decision that strongly affects both the statistical fit and interpretability of topic models. In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.

TL;DR: FTBSC-KGML is a machine learning framework combining pretraining-fine-tuning and spatial-variability awareness to improve agroecosystem carbon cycle quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and cost-effective quantification of agroecosystem carbon cycles is crucial for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture, but current methods underutilize transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity.

Method: FTBSC-KGML integrates pretraining-fine-tuning, spatial-variability awareness, and knowledge-guided ML to leverage remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil data across regions.

Result: FTBSC-KGML outperforms purely global models with lower validation error and better spatial variability capture, maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework advances agroecosystem carbon quantification by enhancing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity utilization.

Abstract: Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the agroecosystem carbon cycle at decision-relevant scales is essential for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states. This work extends the prior SDSA-KGML framework.

*Paul Seurin,Dean Price,Luis Nunez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometric design optimization approach for heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs) to improve financial viability by integrating techno-economic analyses and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPMRs are promising for remote areas but face financial challenges due to diseconomies of scale. Early-stage design optimization is needed.

Method: Random samples train surrogate models (GPs and MLPs), used in an RL framework to optimize LCOE under constraints like fuel lifetime and peak heat flux.

Result: Optimization reduced LCOE by over 57%, with axial reflector and control drum costs being major contributors.

Conclusion: Further integration of fuel and heat-pipe performance with multi-objective optimization is underway.

Abstract: Microreactors, particularly heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs), are compact, transportable, self-regulated power systems well-suited for access-challenged remote areas where costly fossil fuels dominate. However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about transparency, compliance, and trust in automated Big Data analytics for fraud and risk management by leveraging XAI.

Method: Review Big Data tools (e.g., distributed storage, streaming platforms) and fraud detection models (e.g., anomaly detectors, graph-based approaches), alongside XAI techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP). Propose a scalable framework combining infrastructure with explanation mechanisms.

Result: Identified gaps in scalability, real-time processing, and explainability for graph/temporal models, leading to a conceptual framework for scalable XAI.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on scalable XAI, privacy-aware explanations, and standardized evaluations for explainable fraud detection systems.

Abstract: Big Data has become central to modern applications in finance, insurance, and cybersecurity, enabling machine learning systems to perform large-scale risk assessments and fraud detection. However, the increasing dependence on automated analytics introduces important concerns about transparency, regulatory compliance, and trust. This paper examines how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be integrated into Big Data analytics pipelines for fraud detection and risk management. We review key Big Data characteristics and survey major analytical tools, including distributed storage systems, streaming platforms, and advanced fraud detection models such as anomaly detectors, graph-based approaches, and ensemble classifiers. We also present a structured review of widely used XAI methods, including LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, and attention mechanisms, and analyze their strengths and limitations when deployed at scale. Based on these findings, we identify key research gaps related to scalability, real-time processing, and explainability for graph and temporal models. To address these challenges, we outline a conceptual framework that integrates scalable Big Data infrastructure with context-aware explanation mechanisms and human feedback. The paper concludes with open research directions in scalable XAI, privacy-aware explanations, and standardized evaluation methods for explainable fraud detection systems.

*Rahul Bhargava,Malene Hornstrup Jespersen,Emily Boardman Ndulue,Vivica Dsouza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines biases in an AI model trained on the New York Times Annotated Corpus, focusing on the problematic 'blacks' label, its origins, and its impact on modern topics like anti-Asian hate and Black Lives Matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and analyze how historical biases encoded in AI models affect contemporary applications, particularly in newsrooms.

Method: Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the 'blacks' label in the training corpus, along with explainable AI techniques to understand its function.

Result: The label acts as a partial 'racism detector' but fails on modern topics, highlighting risks of bias reproduction.

Conclusion: Newsrooms must balance AI adoption with bias mitigation to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

Abstract: AI technologies have rapidly moved into business and research applications that involve large text corpora, including computational journalism research and newsroom settings. These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning "blacks" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the "blacks" label operates partially as a general "racism detector" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.

*Shu Wan,Reepal Shah,John Sabo,Huan Liu,K. Selçuk Candan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CauSTream is a causal spatiotemporal framework for streamflow forecasting that outperforms existing methods by learning adaptive causal graphs and offering interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models lack interpretability and generalization due to ignoring physical processes, while causal learning methods often use fixed causal graphs.

Method: CauSTream jointly learns runoff and routing causal graphs under nonparametric identifiability conditions and evaluates on three U.S. river basins.

Result: CauSTream outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in longer forecast windows, and infers causal structures aligning with domain knowledge.

Conclusion: CauSTream provides a principled, interpretable foundation for spatiotemporal modeling with potential applications in scientific and environmental domains.

Abstract: Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.

*Peter Chen,Xiaopeng Li,Ziniu Li,Wotao Yin,Xi Chen,Tianyi Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how spurious rewards and entropy minimization improve reasoning in LLMs via RLVR, revealing that clipping bias reduces policy entropy for better performance, while proposing a reward-misalignment model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the paradoxical improvement of reasoning in LLMs through mechanisms like spurious rewards and entropy minimization in RLVR.

Method: Analyzes policy entropy's role and spurious rewards' effects via clipping bias and model contamination, proposing a reward-misalignment model.

Result: Clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, enhancing performance; entropy minimization alone is insufficient.

Conclusion: Spurious rewards improve LLM reasoning via clipping bias, clarified by a reward-misalignment model, guiding more effective RLVR training.

Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

*Shao-Ting Chiu,Aditya Nambiar,Ali Syed,Jonathan W. Siegel,Ulisses Braga-Neto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepOSets, a neural architecture combining DeepSets and DeepONets, demonstrates in-context learning (ICL) capabilities for solving PDEs without weight updates, showing universal approximation properties for continuous operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore and extend the ICL capabilities of DeepOSets beyond supervised learning, particularly focusing on solving PDEs with unseen parameters during training.

Method: Modified DeepOSets architecture is used to recover solution operators from example pairs in prompts, tested on Poisson and reaction-diffusion boundary-value problems.

Result: DeepOSets accurately predicts solutions for new PDEs using in-context examples, proving its universal approximation capability for continuous operators.

Conclusion: DeepOSets is a versatile multi-operator in-context learner capable of universal approximation, advancing scientific machine learning.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is the remarkable capability displayed by some machine learning models to learn from examples in a prompt, without any further weight updates. ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training.

*Saeed Mahloujifar,Narine Kokhlikyan,Chuan Guo,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates privacy risks in image obfuscation methods (Gaussian blur, pixelization, DP-Pix, cropping) and introduces Privacy Blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in image data release while maintaining usefulness for model-training.

Method: Compare Gaussian blur, pixelization, DP-Pix, and cropping using reversal/discrimination attacks and model-training utility.

Result: Gaussian blur is least private; pixelization and DP-Pix offer better privacy-utility tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Pixelization and DP-Pix at right granularity are recommended; Privacy Blur is released for implementation.

Abstract: Image data collected in the wild often contains private information such as faces and license plates, and responsible data release must ensure that this information stays hidden. At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur.

TL;DR: AIMM is an AI-driven framework that analyzes Reddit activity and market data to predict market manipulation risks. It includes a labeled dataset, evaluation methods, and showed early warnings for the GME incident.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Market manipulation increasingly stems from coordinated social media campaigns, necessitating tools to link online narratives to market behavior.

Method: AIMM combines Reddit activity, bot indicators, and market data into a daily risk score. Uses synthetic social features and real market data, with a Streamlit dashboard for analysis.

Result: AIMM flagged GME 22 days before its peak in January 2021, showing preliminary discriminative capability despite a small labeled dataset.

Conclusion: AIMM provides early warnings and tools for surveillance of social media-driven market manipulation, with released code and dataset for further research.

Abstract: Market manipulation now routinely originates from coordinated social media campaigns, not isolated trades. Retail investors, regulators, and brokerages need tools that connect online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior. We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.
  The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak.
  The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance.

*Hamed Ajorlou,Samuel Rey,Gonzalo Mateos,Geert Leus,Antonio G. Marques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BUILD is a deterministic algorithm for learning DAG structures from observational data, leveraging the ensemble precision matrix's distinctive properties for accurate recovery. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods with controlled complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of learning DAG structures from observational data, crucial for causal discovery and machine learning. It leverages identifiability under linear Gaussian SEMs with equal noise variances.

Method: BUILD is proposed, a stepwise algorithm identifying leaf nodes and their parents, pruning leaves iteratively to reconstruct the DAG. Precision matrix re-estimation enhances robustness against finite-data errors.

Result: BUILD demonstrates superior performance on synthetic benchmarks compared to existing DAG learning algorithms, achieving accurate DAG recovery.

Conclusion: BUILD offers a robust and deterministic approach for DAG learning, balancing accuracy and complexity, validated by reproducible results.

Abstract: Learning the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data is a central problem in causal discovery, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.

TL;DR: The paper explores privacy risks to retained data in machine unlearning, introducing Dual-View Inference Attack (DVIA) to demonstrate vulnerabilities in dual-view settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unexplored privacy risks to retained data in machine unlearning, especially in dual-view settings where adversaries query both original and unlearned models.

Method: Proposes DVIA, a black-box attack that leverages dual-view queries to extract membership data without training an attack model, using likelihood ratio inference.

Result: DVIA effectively exposes privacy risks in dual-view settings, validated across datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: Dual-view settings amplify privacy leakage, necessitating awareness and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is a newly popularized technique for removing specific training data from a trained model, enabling it to comply with data deletion requests. While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.

TL;DR: A multimodal framework using graph-based analysis of hand-drawn cubes for early Alzheimer's disease detection, outperforming pixel-based methods and integrating demographic and neuropsychological data for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease is challenging; cube-copying tasks provide simple yet informative assessments of visuospatial function.

Method: Hand-drawn cube sketches are converted into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, processed with graph neural networks, and fused with demographic and neuropsychological test scores using a late-fusion model.

Result: Graph-based representations outperform pixel-based models, and multimodal integration enhances performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors.

Conclusion: Graph-based analysis of cube copying is an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable method for Alzheimer's disease screening.

Abstract: Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical clinical challenge, and cube-copying tasks offer a simple yet informative assessment of visuospatial function. This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD. Together, these results establish graph-based analysis of cube copying as an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening.

TL;DR: stMFG is a novel multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that dynamically integrates spatial and gene features using layer-wise cross-view attention, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial transcriptomics methods process spatial and feature views separately, limiting multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction.

Method: stMFG introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution, combining cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints.

Result: stMFG achieves up to 14% Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) improvement on DLPFC and breast cancer datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: stMFG enhances discriminability and spatial continuity by integrating multi-scale interactions, demonstrating superior performance in spatial domain identification.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables genome-wide expression analysis within native tissue context, yet identifying spatial domains remains challenging due to complex gene-spatial interactions. Existing methods typically process spatial and feature views separately, fusing only at output level - an "encode-separately, fuse-late" paradigm that limits multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction. Accordingly, stMFG is proposed, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution. The model combines cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints to enhance discriminability while maintaining spatial continuity. On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides explicit, non-asymptotic convergence rates for rank-based zeroth-order optimization algorithms, addressing a gap in theoretical understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses of rank-based ZO methods lack explicit convergence rates, motivating this work to bridge the gap and provide theoretical insights.

Method: The authors analyze a simple rank-based ZO algorithm, deriving explicit query complexities for smooth convex and nonconvex functions.

Result: For smooth convex functions, the algorithm achieves polylogarithmic complexity, while for smooth nonconvex functions, it reaches logarithmic complexity.

Conclusion: The analysis avoids classical techniques, offering new insights into the efficiency of rank-based ZO optimization.

Abstract: Rank-based zeroth-order (ZO) optimization -- which relies only on the ordering of function evaluations -- offers strong robustness to noise and monotone transformations, and underlies many successful algorithms such as CMA-ES, natural evolution strategies, and rank-based genetic algorithms. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.
  This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \emph{explicit}, and \emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $μ$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\!\left(\frac{dL}μ\log\!\frac{dL}{μδ}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\mathcal O\!\left(\frac{dL}{\varepsilon}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$. Notation $\cO(\cdot)$ hides constant terms and $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\cdot)$ hides extra $\log\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ term. These query complexities hold with a probability at least $1-δ$ with $0<δ<1$. The analysis in this paper is novel and avoids classical drift and information-geometric techniques. Our analysis offers new insight into why rank-based heuristics lead to efficient ZO optimization.

*Lorenzo Nava,Ye Chen,Maximillian Van Wyk de Vries*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning model predicts geohazard runout accurately and faster than traditional methods, aiding disaster risk reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geohazards like landslides and avalanches cause significant harm; predicting their runout is vital for safety but current methods are slow or unrealistic.

Method: Train a machine learning model on over 100,000 numerical simulations across 10,000 real terrains to predict flow extent and deposit thickness.

Result: The model predicts runout with high accuracy, 100 to 10,000 times faster than numerical solvers, and generalizes across flow types and landscapes.

Conclusion: Neural emulation offers rapid, realistic runout prediction, enhancing early warning systems and disaster risk reduction.

Abstract: Predicting geohazard runout is critical for protecting lives, infrastructure and ecosystems. Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting. These results highlight neural emulation as a promising pathway for extending physically realistic geohazard modelling to spatial and temporal scales relevant for large scale early warning systems.

*Xueqi Ma,Xingjun Ma,Sarah Monazam Erfani,Danilo Mandic,James Bailey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework using LLMs for graph datasets, improving OOD detection and classification without true label information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods treat all OOD samples as one class, lacking deeper insights needed for real-world applications like fraud detection and medical diagnosis.

Method: CFC uses LLMs for coarse OOD detection and label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier for improved ID classification and OOD detection, and LLMs for refined OOD classification.

Result: CFC improves OOD detection by 10% over state-of-the-art methods and achieves up to 70% accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

Conclusion: The CFC framework effectively addresses the need for deeper OOD insights, demonstrating superior performance in both detection and classification tasks.

Abstract: Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

*Ruiyu Li,Peige Zhao,Guangxia Li,Pengcheng Wu,Xingyu Gao,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SEAL, a sharpness-aware federated graph learning algorithm, to improve generalization and classification accuracy in heterogeneous graph data by minimizing loss function sharpness and relaxing representation correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data heterogeneity and privacy concerns in federated graph learning (FGL) by mitigating local model sharpness and dimensional collapse issues.

Method: Introduces an optimization objective to minimize loss and its sharpness, and a regularizer to relax representation correlations, forming the SEAL algorithm.

Result: SEAL outperforms state-of-the-art FGL baselines in graph classification benchmarks, enhancing accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: SEAL effectively addresses data heterogeneity in FGL by improving local model generalization and alleviating dimensional collapse, benefiting large-scale graph applications.

Abstract: One of many impediments to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to large-scale real-world graph data is the challenge of centralized training, which requires aggregating data from different organizations, raising privacy concerns. Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model. The proposed \textbf{S}harpness-aware f\textbf{E}derated gr\textbf{A}ph \textbf{L}earning (SEAL) algorithm can enhance the classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated graph learning. Experimental studies on several graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms SOTA FGL baselines and provides gains for more participants.

### [216] [Sharpness-aware Second-order Latent Factor Model for High-dimensional and Incomplete Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16277)
*Jialiang Wang,Xueyan Bao,Hao Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF), a model that improves second-order latent factor methods by incorporating sharpness-aware minimization to handle non-convex optimization challenges in high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty of optimizing second-order latent factor models due to their bilinear and non-convex nature, which hampers effective representation learning in high-dimensional and incomplete data.

Method: The method involves integrating sharpness-aware minimization into the SLF model. Key steps include acquiring second-order information via Hessian-vector products and injecting a sharpness term into the curvature through these products.

Result: Experiments on industrial datasets show that the proposed SSLF model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that incorporating sharpness-aware minimization into second-order latent factor models enhances their optimization and generalization, leading to better performance in representation learning tasks.

Abstract: Second-order Latent Factor (SLF) model, a class of low-rank representation learning methods, has proven effective at extracting node-to-node interaction patterns from High-dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) data. However, its optimization is notoriously difficult due to its bilinear and non-convex nature. Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) has recently proposed to find flat local minima when minimizing non-convex objectives, thereby improving the generalization of representation-learning models. To address this challenge, we propose a Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model. SSLF embodies two key ideas: (1) acquiring second-order information via Hessian-vector products; and (2) injecting a sharpness term into the curvature (Hessian) through the designed Hessian-vector products. Experiments on multiple industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: Introduces CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free method for heterogeneous quantization in large language models, outperforming uniform and mixed-precision baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of uniform quantization strategies ignoring layer-specific algorithmic suitability.

Method: Evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms per layer using Linear CKA to select optimal strategies, integrating them into a hybrid model.

Result: Consistently outperforms baselines in perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance across LLMs like LLaMA and Qwen.

Conclusion: Proposes an effective, plug-and-play framework for heterogeneous quantization, enhancing model efficiency without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Current mainstream post-training quantization methods for large language models typically apply a uniform quantization strategy across all network layers, overlooking the substantial differences in algorithmic suitability among layers. To address this limitation, we propose CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization. Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer. The individually optimized strategies are then integrated to construct a hybrid quantized model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods across mainstream LLMs including LLaMA and Qwen ,in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance.

*Taozhao Chen,Linghan Huang,Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SRMU, a novel framework for machine unlearning in LLMs, addressing challenges of entangled datasets and ensuring safety without degrading utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate risks like privacy leakage and regulatory non-compliance in LLMs by enabling controlled removal of sensitive knowledge.

Method: Introduces Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), using feature-aware, directional perturbations and activation importance maps.

Result: SRMU outperforms baselines, achieving effective unlearning with minimal utility loss, even with 20-30% dataset overlap.

Conclusion: SRMU offers a robust solution for safety and privacy compliance in LLMs, enabling controlled knowledge removal.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on. Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying predictive uncertainty is crucial for reliable AI deployment, but nonparametric estimation of multivariate conditional distributions is challenging.

Method: TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections and reconstructs the multivariate distribution by minimizing sliced Wasserstein distance using an efficient alternating scheme.

Result: TQF outperforms classical directional-quantile methods by covering all directions with a single model and avoiding convexity restrictions.

Conclusion: TQF provides an effective, uncertainty-aware solution for multivariate conditional distribution estimation, demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Quantifying predictive uncertainty is essential for safe and trustworthy real-world AI deployment. Yet, fully nonparametric estimation of conditional distributions remains challenging for multivariate targets. We propose Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF), a nonparametric, uncertainty-aware, tree-based regression model for multivariate targets. TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections $\mathbf{n}^{\top}\mathbf{y}$ as functions of the input $\mathbf{x}$ and the unit direction $\mathbf{n}$. At inference, it aggregates quantiles across many directions and reconstructs the multivariate conditional distribution by minimizing the sliced Wasserstein distance via an efficient alternating scheme with convex subproblems. Unlike classical directional-quantile approaches that typically produce only convex quantile regions and require training separate models for different directions, TQF covers all directions with a single model without imposing convexity restrictions. We evaluate TQF on synthetic and real-world datasets, and release the source code on GitHub.

### [220] [Quantitative Verification of Fairness in Tree Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16386)
*Zhenjiang Zhao,Takahisa Toda,Takashi Kitamura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantitative verification for fairness in tree ensembles, extending beyond traditional single-counterexample methods to estimate all counterexamples' ratio and their regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fairness verification by quantifying counterexamples and diagnosing bias more effectively, addressing limitations in existing methods for deep neural networks.

Method: Extended a model-agnostic framework (Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement) and proposed an efficient quantification technique for tree ensembles, providing anytime upper and lower bounds.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art fairness testing techniques on five datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances fairness verification by offering precise quantification and scalability for tree ensembles.

Abstract: This work focuses on quantitative verification of fairness in tree ensembles. Unlike traditional verification approaches that merely return a single counterexample when the fairness is violated, quantitative verification estimates the ratio of all counterexamples and characterizes the regions where they occur, which is important information for diagnosing and mitigating bias. To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds. Experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. When applied to fairness testing, our quantification method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art testing techniques.

### [221] [Kascade: A Practical Sparse Attention Method for Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16391)
*Dhruv Deshmukh,Saurabh Goyal,Nipun Kwatra,Ramachandran Ramjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kascade is a training-free sparse attention method that speeds up long-context LLM inference by reusing Top-k indices from anchor layers, achieving significant speedups while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms in long-context LLM inference are latency-heavy, driving the need for efficient sparse attention methods.

Method: Kascade reuses Top-k indices from anchor layers, selected via dynamic programming for cross-layer similarity, and incorporates head-aware operations for efficiency.

Result: Kascade achieves up to 4.1x decode attention and 2.2x prefill attention speedups over FlashAttention-3 on H100 GPUs, with comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: Kascade effectively reduces latency in long-context LLM inference without sacrificing accuracy, making it practical for deployment.

Abstract: Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalized operator learning framework (GLNO) for handling non-periodic excitations and irregular geometries, validated by superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators struggle with non-periodic excitations and irregular geometries, prompting the need for a more versatile solution.

Method: Proposes GLNO based on pole-residue decomposition and exponential basis functions, and GLNONet for grid-invariant implementation.

Result: Demonstrates robust performance on PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: GLNO effectively extends operator learning to arbitrary manifolds without periodicity or uniform grids.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient solutions to partial differential equations across varying inputs and domains. Despite the success, existing methods often struggle with non-periodic excitations, transient responses, and signals defined on irregular or non-Euclidean geometries. To address this, we propose a generalized operator learning framework based on a pole-residue decomposition enriched with exponential basis functions, enabling expressive modeling of aperiodic and decaying dynamics. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO), which embeds the Laplace spectral representation into the eigen-basis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, extending operator learning to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds without requiring periodicity or uniform grids. We further design a grid-invariant network architecture (GLNONet) that realizes GLNO in practice. Extensive experiments on PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets demonstrate our robust performance over other state-of-the-art models.

*Filippo Zacchei,Paolo Conti,Attilio Alberto Frangi,Andrea Manzoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme using neural networks to improve computational efficiency in Bayesian inverse problems, combining solvers of varying fidelity to avoid costly high-fidelity simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks with physics-based models are computationally expensive, especially with full-order models like Finite Element Method. Traditional methods like MCMC become infeasible, and surrogate models face limitations due to high-fidelity data costs. Low-fidelity data is cheaper but less accurate.

Method: The method introduces a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme using multi-fidelity neural networks. High-fidelity evaluations are done offline, while online phase uses coarse solvers and trained neural networks to avoid costly simulations.

Result: The approach improves low-fidelity solver accuracy, enabling longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and faster posterior inference. Demonstrated effectiveness on groundwater flow and reaction-diffusion problems with significant computational savings.

Conclusion: The proposed Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme is a flexible and efficient solution for Bayesian inverse problems, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks such as parameter estimation are computationally demanding whenever dealing with physics-based models, and typically require repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers. When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.
  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained.

*Maeve Madigan,Parameswaran Kamalaruban,Glenn Moynihan,Tom Kempton,David Sutton,Stuart Burrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TLDR: Fairness evaluation methodologies are needed for multi-agent predictive systems in finance to address emergent bias risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of effective evaluation methodologies for multi-agent systems poses risks of bias in high-stakes domains like finance, potentially leading to regulatory breaches and financial losses.

Method: Develop fairness evaluation methodologies and measure fairness characteristics in financial tabular domains using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations.

Result: Patterns of emergent bias were found in financial decision-making, indicating collective behaviors in multi-agent systems that cannot be traced to individual agents.

Conclusion: Fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems are significant and must be evaluated holistically, not just by analyzing individual components.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have demonstrated the ability to improve performance on a variety of predictive tasks by leveraging collaborative decision making. However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) for automated detection of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) cells in microscopic blood images, achieving high accuracy on the ALL-IDB2 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual diagnosis of ALL is error-prone and time-consuming. Automated AI-based methods can improve accuracy and efficiency in identifying cancerous cells.

Method: A CNN combined with HOSVD classifier is used to classify ALL and normal cells from microscopic blood images within an IoMT framework.

Result: The model achieved an average accuracy of 98.88% on the ALL-IDB2 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed AI-based framework enables quick and reliable leukemia detection, facilitating real-time communication between patients and clinicians.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept by which objects find identity and can communicate with each other in a network. One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via progressive layer-wise distillation, enabling integer-only inference without BN layers while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QNNs rely on BN layers, hindering true integer-only deployment. Prior methods fail to fully recover BN's benefits.

Method: A progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme is used, starting from a BN-enabled teacher to train a BN-free student with integer-only inference.

Result: The BN-free model achieves competitive Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with AlexNet under aggressive quantisation.

Conclusion: The method enables end-to-end integer-only inference, suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Quantised neural networks (QNNs) shrink models and reduce inference energy through low-bit arithmetic, yet most still depend on a running statistics batch normalisation (BN) layer, preventing true integer-only deployment. Prior attempts remove BN by parameter folding or tailored initialisation; while helpful, they rarely recover BN's stability and accuracy and often impose bespoke constraints. We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLSCAN, a new density-based clustering algorithm, efficiently identifies stable clusters across various sizes, outperforming HDBSCAN* in accuracy and sensitivity, with competitive computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in selecting hyperparameters for density-based clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and HDBSCAN* without prior knowledge of data distribution motivates the development of PLSCAN.

Method: PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space, identifying stable leaf clusters for all minimum sizes.

Result: PLSCAN achieves higher average Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) than HDBSCAN* and is less sensitive to mutual reachability neighbors. It shows competitive run-times to k-Means in low dimensions and scales similarly to HDBSCAN* in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: PLSCAN is a robust and efficient alternative to existing density-based clustering methods, offering improved performance and stability across varying datasets.

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of modern data analysis. Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets. At higher dimensions, run times scale more similarly to HDBSCAN*.

*Sullivan Castro,Artem Betlei,Thomas Di Martino,Nadir El Manouzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Abacus enhances deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining for better user purchase behavior prediction in display advertising, outperforming baselines by up to +6.1% AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User purchase behavior modeling is challenging due to sparse positive events and stochastic actions, leading to class imbalance and irregular timing. Existing methods overlook fine-grained temporal evolution and event-counting statistics.

Method: Introduces Abacus, a self-supervised pretraining approach predicting user event frequency distribution. Combines it with sequential learning via a hybrid objective, merging aggregated statistics' stability with sequence modeling sensitivity.

Result: Abacus pretraining outperforms existing methods, accelerating downstream task convergence. The hybrid approach achieves up to +6.1% AUC improvement.

Conclusion: Abacus and the hybrid objective effectively address sparsity and stochasticity in user behavior, enhancing predictive performance in display advertising.

Abstract: Modeling user purchase behavior is a critical challenge in display advertising systems, necessary for real-time bidding. The difficulty arises from the sparsity of positive user events and the stochasticity of user actions, leading to severe class imbalance and irregular event timing. Predictive systems usually rely on hand-crafted "counter" features, overlooking the fine-grained temporal evolution of user intent. Meanwhile, current sequential models extract direct sequential signal, missing useful event-counting statistics. We enhance deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining strategies for display advertising. Especially, we introduce Abacus, a novel approach of predicting the empirical frequency distribution of user events. We further propose a hybrid objective unifying Abacus with sequential learning objectives, combining stability of aggregated statistics with the sequence modeling sensitivity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Abacus pretraining outperforms existing methods accelerating downstream task convergence, while hybrid approach yields up to +6.1% AUC compared to the baselines.

*Liu Yang,Qiang Li,Luxiong Wen,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method, MS-SHOT, addresses performance degradation in cross-receiver RFFI by using momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and global structural constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based RFFI models degrade when used across receivers with hardware variations, necessitating a solution for source-data-free adaptation.

Method: Proposes MS-SHOT, combining momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and structural constraints to improve pseudo-label quality and adaptability.

Result: MS-SHOT outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MS-SHOT provides a scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI adaptation, addressing label shift and non-uniform class distribution challenges.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender classification from blogs has broad applications, motivating a study comparing traditional ML and deep learning with NeSy.

Method: Evaluated SVM, NB, LR, AdaBoost, XGBoost, SVM_R, TF-IDF, USE, RoBERTa, Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and PCA alongside NeSy.

Result: NeSy matched MLP performance despite limited data, highlighting its potential.

Abstract: Text classification problems, such as gender classification from a blog, have been a well-matured research area that has been well studied using machine learning algorithms. It has several application domains in market analysis, customer recommendation, and recommendation systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of the widely used machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and an SVM variant (SVM_R) with neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy). The paper also explores the effect of text representations such as TF-IDF, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and RoBERTa. Additionally, various feature extraction techniques, including Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis, are explored. Building on these, we introduce a comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning approaches in comparison to the NeSy. The experimental results show that the use of the NeSy approach matched strong MLP results despite a limited dataset. Future work on this research will expand the knowledge base, the scope of embedding types, and the hyperparameter configuration to further study the effectiveness of the NeSy approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLARiTy is a vision transformer-based model for multi-label pathology classification and weakly-supervised localization in chest X-rays, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient variants for low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in accurate multi-label pathology classification and spatial localization in CXRs, especially with limited dense annotations.

Method: Uses class-specific tokens, SegmentCAM for segmentation, distillation from ConvNeXtV2, and leverages image-level labels.

Result: Achieves competitive classification and SOTA localization, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%, with pronounced gains for small pathologies.

Conclusion: CLARiTy advances CNN-ViT hybrids by combining ViT self-attention and convolutional refinement for precise localization.

Abstract: The interpretation of chest X-rays (CXRs) poses significant challenges, particularly in achieving accurate multi-label pathology classification and spatial localization. These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PPM techniques lack reproducibility, transparency, and usability, making comparisons difficult.

Method: Proposes SPICE, a framework reimplementing baseline PPM methods in PyTorch with a common base for configurability and benchmarking.

Result: Evaluated on 11 datasets, SPICE achieves comparable or improved metrics against original implementations.

Conclusion: SPICE enables reproducible and fair comparisons of PPM methods, addressing limitations in existing approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, Predictive Process Mining (PPM) techniques based on artificial neural networks have evolved as a method for monitoring the future behavior of unfolding business processes and predicting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). However, many PPM approaches often lack reproducibility, transparency in decision making, usability for incorporating novel datasets and benchmarking, making comparisons among different implementations very difficult. In this paper, we propose SPICE, a Python framework that reimplements three popular, existing baseline deep-learning-based methods for PPM in PyTorch, while designing a common base framework with rigorous configurability to enable reproducible and robust comparison of past and future modelling approaches. We compare SPICE to original reported metrics and with fair metrics on 11 datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phishing attacks are evolving, requiring advanced detection methods to protect users effectively.

Method: Uses an ensemble of character-level CNN and LightGBM with engineered URL features.

Result: Achieves 99.819% accuracy, 100% precision, 99.635% recall, and 99.947% ROC-AUC on 19,873 URLs.

Conclusion: The ensemble outperforms individual models, offering real-time detection with low false positives.

Abstract: In actuality, phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent cybersecurity risks in existence today, with malevolent actors constantly changing their strategies to successfully trick users. This paper presents an AI model for a phishing detection system that uses an ensemble approach to combine character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LightGBM with engineered features. Our system uses a character-level CNN to extract sequential features after extracting 36 lexical, structural, and domain-based features from the URLs. On a test dataset of 19,873 URLs, the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99.819 percent, precision of 100 percent, recall of 99.635 percent, and ROC-AUC of 99.947 percent. Through a FastAPI-based service with an intuitive user interface, the suggested system has been utilised to offer real-time detection. In contrast, the results demonstrate that the suggested solution performs better than individual models; LightGBM contributes 40 percent and character-CNN contributes 60 percent to the final prediction. The suggested method maintains extremely low false positive rates while doing a good job of identifying contemporary phishing techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable cascade architecture using polyharmonic splines to address computational and high-dimensionality limitations in machine learning regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the O(N^3) computational cost and theoretical breakdown in high-dimensional spaces of the previous polyharmonic spline solution.

Method: Introduces a cascade architecture built from polyharmonic spline packages, with efficient matrix procedures for computation and differentiation.

Result: Simultaneously improves scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of the previous approach while maintaining theoretical soundness.

Abstract: In a previous paper it was shown that a machine learning regression problem can be solved within the framework of random function theory, with the optimal kernel analytically derived from symmetry and indifference principles and coinciding with a polyharmonic spline. However, a direct application of that solution is limited by O(N^3) computational cost and by a breakdown of the original theoretical assumptions when the input space has excessive dimensionality. This paper proposes a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines that simultaneously addresses scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality. Efficient matrix procedures are presented for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing digital fraud in Hajj/Umrah services to prevent financial losses and privacy risks from counterfeit apps.

Method: Uses SVM, RF, and NB classifiers on a dataset of official/unofficial apps, combining TF-IDF and metadata analysis for feature extraction.

Result: SVM outperforms with 92.3% accuracy; keywords and high-risk permissions like 'READ PHONE STATE' are key discriminators.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable solution to boost digital trust, potentially serving as a national verification system prototype.

Abstract: The rapid digitalization of Hajj and Umrah services in Indonesia has significantly facilitated pilgrims but has concurrently opened avenues for digital fraud through counterfeit mobile applications. These fraudulent applications not only inflict financial losses but also pose severe privacy risks by harvesting sensitive personal data. This research aims to address this critical issue by implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to verify application authenticity automatically. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators. This system is proposed as a proactive, scalable solution to enhance digital trust in the religious tourism sector, potentially serving as a prototype for a national verification system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NRGPT, a modification of GPT that integrates energy-based modeling (EBM), framing inference as exploring tokens on an energy landscape. It shows theoretical and empirical evidence of gradient descent behavior and demonstrates performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify GPT architectures with energy-based modeling, offering a new perspective on inference as an energy landscape exploration.

Method: Minimal modification of GPT to incorporate EBM, conceptualizing inference as token exploration on an energy landscape.

Result: NRGPT performs well on simple language tasks, algebraic tasks, and richer language modeling, showing potential resistance to overfitting.

Conclusion: The NRGPT framework successfully bridges GPT and EBM, proving effective across diverse tasks and hinting at improved robustness.

Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architectures are the most popular design for language modeling. Energy-based modeling is a different paradigm that views inference as a dynamical process operating on an energy landscape. We propose a minimal modification of the GPT setting to unify it with the EBM framework. The inference step of our model, which we call eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), is conceptualized as an exploration of the tokens on the energy landscape. We prove, and verify empirically, that under certain circumstances this exploration becomes gradient descent, although they don't necessarily lead to the best performing models. We demonstrate that our model performs well for simple language (Shakespeare dataset), algebraic ListOPS tasks, and richer settings such as OpenWebText language modeling. We also observe that our models may be more resistant to overfitting, doing so only during very long training.

TL;DR: The paper presents a geometric framework for analyzing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, introducing a two-parameter family of metrics to address challenges in modeling and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making traditional methods inadequate. The paper aims to overcome these limitations using geometric approaches.

Method: The authors propose a geometric framework based on vector fields over discrete measure spaces, introducing metrics suitable for data analysis. The method is validated using numerical simulations of biological and physical systems.

Result: The proposed metrics effectively enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterization, as demonstrated in simulations on flat and curved domains.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust solution for analyzing complex dynamical systems, particularly when traditional modeling is impractical but abundant data is available.

Abstract: A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEPIC introduces a memory-efficient system for chunk KV reuse in LLM applications, reducing HBM usage significantly by aligning chunk KV storage and optimizing recomputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency of current KV caching methods in LLM applications, which struggle with memory constraints and divergent KV layouts, limiting reuse and storage savings.

Method: MEPIC aligns chunk KV storage for paged sharing, shifts recomputation to block-level, removes positional encodings via RoPE fusion, and ensures remaining blocks are fully shareable.

Result: The system reduces HBM usage by up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art PIC, and up to 5x for long prompts, without altering model performance.

Conclusion: MEPIC effectively addresses memory inefficiencies in LLM applications, enabling significant KV reuse across positions and requests while maintaining latency and accuracy.

Abstract: Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.
  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

*Amit Jain,Richard Linares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRC is a neural architecture that achieves efficient control synthesis with minimal parameters by leveraging iterative refinement and shared weights, enabling millisecond-scale inference and low memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scaling of neural network controllers with millions or billions of parameters is impractical for embedded aerospace systems due to power and latency constraints. TRC aims to address this by deriving capacity from iterative depth rather than parameter count.

Method: TRC employs compact networks (~1.5M parameters) iteratively through a hierarchical latent structure. It refines control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting tracking errors, using the same weights for each iteration.

Result: TRC achieves near-optimal control costs for nonlinear problems like oscillator stabilization and powered descent, with millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10MB memory usage—significantly smaller than language model baselines.

Conclusion: TRC demonstrates that recursive reasoning, effective for discrete tasks, can also be applied to continuous control synthesis, offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: Neural network controllers increasingly demand millions of parameters, and language model approaches push into the billions. For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis.

TL;DR: LaMer, a Meta-RL framework, enhances LLM agents' exploration and adaptation during tasks, outperforming RL baselines by 11-19% and showing better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of RL-trained LLM agents in active exploration and adaptation from trial-and-error experiences.

Method: Introduces LaMer with cross-episode training for exploration and in-context policy adaptation via reflection.

Result: Achieves 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper, and Webshop, respectively, with improved generalization.

Conclusion: Meta-RL, via LaMer, offers a principled approach to boost exploration and adaptation in language agents.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.

### [242] [Semi-Supervised Online Learning on the Edge by Transforming Knowledge from Teacher Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16866)
*Jiabin Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online Edge ML trains models directly on edge devices by addressing the challenge of labeling unseen data with Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. KT uses a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for a student model, showing promising results with stable teacher models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Edge ML approaches assume static models trained centrally, making them ineffective for unseen data. Online Edge ML aims to continuously update models with new data, but labeling future data poses a challenge.

Method: Proposes Knowledge Transformation (KT), which combines Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. KT acts as an oracle to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model using a teacher model.

Result: Simulation experiments show that with a stable teacher model, the student model achieves expected maximum performance. KT is effective when the teacher's task is generic or student labels are hard to acquire.

Conclusion: KT offers a viable solution for labeling unseen data in Online Edge ML, especially with stable teacher models, benefiting scenarios with generic teacher tasks or costly student labels.

Abstract: Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: "How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, the study investigates the impact of task sequencing, aiming to enhance adaptive knowledge acquisition in AI systems.

Method: The proposed method uses zero-shot scoring algorithms, inspired by neural architecture search, to determine the optimal task order for reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Intelligent task sequencing significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting and, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, improves overall performance and robustness.

Conclusion: Task sequencing is a viable approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and can complement existing continual learning methods, with potential applications in areas like curriculum learning.

Abstract: To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.

### [244] [Posterior Behavioral Cloning: Pretraining BC Policies for Efficient RL Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16911)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Traditional pretraining with behavioral cloning (BC) may lack coverage for effective RL finetuning. Posterior Behavioral Cloning (PostBC) improves this by modeling the demonstrator's posterior distribution, leading to better finetuning results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pretraining methods often fail to ensure policies are effective initializations for RL finetuning. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: Introduces Posterior Behavioral Cloning (PostBC), which models the demonstrator's posterior distribution instead of exact action matching.

Result: PostBC ensures coverage of demonstrator actions, matches BC's pretraining performance, and significantly improves RL finetuning in robotic tasks.

Conclusion: PostBC is a practical and superior alternative to BC for pretraining policies intended for RL finetuning.

Abstract: Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Ev-Trust is a trust mechanism for LLM-based multi-agent systems, using evolutionary game theory to dynamically adjust agent behavior, exclude malicious participants, and enhance collaboration, proven effective in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems increase risks like deception and misinformation, challenging trust and robustness.

Method: Proposes Ev-Trust, integrating direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure within a decentralized service framework.

Result: Theoretical derivation proves stable local equilibria; experiments show reduced malicious strategies and increased collective revenue.

Conclusion: Ev-Trust offers a novel trust modeling approach for LLM-driven agentic services in evolutionary game scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Web toward an agent-centric paradigm, driven by large language models (LLMs), has enabled autonomous agents to reason, plan, and interact in complex decentralized environments. However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized "Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios.
