Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity.

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications.

Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively.

GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable.

Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept.

While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\\%$, a $1.4\\times$ improvement over SOTA.", "AI": {"tldr": "GinSign framework improves NL-to-TL translation by hierarchically grounding NL spans into system signatures, achieving higher logical-equivalence scores without relying on large language models.", "motivation": "To enable accurate NL-to-TL translation for trustworthy autonomous systems by addressing the grounding accuracy limitations of existing frameworks.", "method": "Proposes GinSign, a hierarchical grounding model that maps NL spans to system signatures via structured classification (predicting predicates first, then constants).

However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions.

Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls.

Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs).

To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework.

One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances.

However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data.

This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process.

Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer.

Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality.

While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region.

One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images.

In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers.

This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most.

However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework.

Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.\n  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable.

This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy.
