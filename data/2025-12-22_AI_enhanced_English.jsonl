This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces an LLM-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory, where agents have three ego states (Parent, Adult, Child) to enhance psychological realism in simulations.", "motivation": "Current LLM agents lack psychological depth and consistency, missing deeper human motivations and emotional conflicts.

Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduces MAPPO and MAPPO-LCR to address payoff coupling and non-stationarity in spatial public goods games, showing improved cooperation and learning over PPO.", "motivation": "Existing methods like evolutionary rules and reinforcement learning struggle with payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large populations.", "method": "Uses Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) with a centralized critic and introduces MAPPO-LCR for local cooperation alignment.", "result": "Demonstrates stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence, with MAPPO outperforming PPO.", "conclusion": "MAPPO and MAPPO-LCR effectively address limitations of prior methods, enhancing cooperation in spatial public goods games."}}

Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline.

Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph.

Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffeoMorph is a differentiable framework that trains agents to form 3D shapes using SE(3)-equivariant graph neural networks and a novel shape-matching loss based on 3D Zernike polynomials.", "motivation": "The paper addresses the challenge of understanding how distributed control leads to precise global patterns in biological systems and its applications in robotics and multi-agent learning.", "method": "The framework uses an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network for agent updates and introduces a shape-matching loss with 3D Zernike polynomials.

This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction.

A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues.

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment.

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality.

By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured \"Disease, Relation, Anatomy\" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Crucially, CheXPO-v2 achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple similar models, which increases computational cost and leads to poor generalization. Although recent joint QoS prediction studies have explored shared architectures, they suffer from negative transfer due to loss-scaling caused by inconsistent numerical ranges across QoS parameters and further struggle with inadequate representation learning, resulting in degraded accuracy. This paper presents an unified strategy for joint QoS prediction, called SHARP-QoS, that addresses these issues using three components.

We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning \"how-to-think\") and (2) strategic visual perception (\"when-to-look\"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm.

MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields.

In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments.

This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens.

Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)\n  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba\n  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper provides causal evidence that in-context learning (ICL) decomposes into two separable mechanisms: Task Schema and Binding, validated across multiple models.", "motivation": "To understand the mechanistic basis of ICL, contrasting prior monolithic views, and to explore how Task Schema and Binding operate independently.", "method": "Activation patching experiments across 9 models (Transformer families and Mamba) to analyze Task Schema and Binding transfers.", "result": "Key findings: Double dissociation between Schema (100% transfer) and Binding (62% transfer), inverse correlation of Schema reliance with prior knowledge, and architecture generality.", "conclusion": "ICL operates via dissociable dual mechanisms, with Schema used when prior knowledge is absent.

These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration.

While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed.

Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains.

This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements.

OmniDirectional Image Super-Resolution (ODISR) is a promising technique for enhancing the visual quality of ODIs. Before performing super-resolution, ODIs are typically projected from a spherical surface onto a plane using EquiRectangular Projection (ERP). This projection introduces latitude-dependent geometric distortion in ERP images: distortion is minimal near the equator but becomes severe toward the poles, where image content is stretched across a wider area. However, existing ODISR methods have limited sampling ranges and feature extraction capabilities, which hinder their ability to capture distorted patterns over large areas. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-level Distortion-aware Deformable Network (MDDN) for ODISR, designed to expand the sampling range and receptive field. Specifically, the feature extractor in MDDN comprises three parallel branches: a deformable attention mechanism (serving as the dilation=1 path) and two dilated deformable convolutions with dilation rates of 2 and 3. This architecture expands the sampling range to include more distorted patterns across wider areas, generating dense and comprehensive features that effectively capture geometric distortions in ERP images. The representations extracted from these deformable feature extractors are adaptively fused in a multi-level feature fusion module. Furthermore, to reduce computational cost, a low-rank decomposition strategy is applied to dilated deformable convolutions.

In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps.

On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy.

To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks by introducing a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective, achieving compact, semantically rich representations for improved image reconstruction and generation.", "motivation": "To unify vision generation and understanding by addressing the lack of compact regularization in discriminative feature spaces and weak pixel-level reconstruction in current LDMs.", "method": "Introducing a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, compressing semantic and fine-grained details into a compact representation (96 channels, 16x16 downsampling).", "result": "Achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, faster convergence, and significant performance gains in Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing tasks.", "conclusion": "Representation encoders can be effectively adapted for robust generative tasks, validating the proposed framework's effectiveness in unifying vision generation and understanding."}}
