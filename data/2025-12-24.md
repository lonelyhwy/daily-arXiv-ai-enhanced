### [1] [PHANTOM: PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing Connected Vehicle Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19711)
*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM is a novel framework exploiting anamorphic art to create perspective-dependent adversarial attacks on CAVs, achieving high success rates across diverse conditions and detectors, while also disrupting V2X communications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAVs rely on DNNs and V2X communication, but remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. PHANTOM aims to exploit these vulnerabilities.

Method: PHANTOM crafts perspective-dependent adversarial examples using anamorphic art, testing them in black-box settings across four detector architectures in CARLA simulations.

Result: PHANTOM achieves >90% attack success under optimal conditions, 60-80% in degraded environments, and disrupts V2X communication, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89%.

Conclusion: PHANTOM exposes critical vulnerabilities in CAV perception and communication layers, highlighting risks in current systems.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

### [2] [Generating the Past, Present and Future from a Motion-Blurred Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19817)
*SaiKiran Tedla,Kelly Zhu,Trevor Canham,Felix Taubner,Michael S. Brown,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new technique uses pre-trained video diffusion models to recover past and future scene dynamics from motion-blurred images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion-blurred images encode motion information, but current methods rely on handcrafted priors and struggle with complex dynamics.

Method: Repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on large-scale datasets to recover videos showing scene dynamics before, during, and after image capture.

Result: Outperforms previous methods, generalizes to in-the-wild images, and supports tasks like camera trajectory recovery and dynamic 3D scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is robust, versatile, and leverages large-scale data to reconstruct complex scene dynamics from blurry images.

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

### [3] [Learning to Refocus with Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19823)
*SaiKiran Tedla,Zhoutong Zhang,Xuaner Zhang,Shumian Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method using video diffusion models enables realistic post-capture refocusing from defocused images, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autofocus systems often fail, and users desire adjustable focus post-capture.

Method: Uses video diffusion models to generate perceptually accurate focal stacks from defocused images.

Result: Produces high-quality focal stacks, outperforming existing methods in perceptual quality and robustness.

Conclusion: Advances focus-editing capabilities for everyday photography, supported by a released dataset.

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

### [4] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits scoring functions for geometric models in RANSAC, extends geometric error to spherical noises, and critiques MAGSAC++, finding it numerically equivalent to simpler models. A new evaluation methodology shows all scoring functions perform similarly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve and critically evaluate scoring functions for robust geometric model fitting, addressing gaps in current methods like MAGSAC++.

Method: Extends geometric error to spherical noises, analyzes MAGSAC++, and introduces a new experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions.

Result: MAGSAC++ is numerically equivalent to simpler models, and all scoring functions perform identically under the proposed evaluation framework.

Conclusion: The study provides a critical reassessment of current scoring methods, highlighting their equivalence and suggesting no superiority for complex models like MAGSAC++.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [5] [Chain-of-Anomaly Thoughts with Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20417)
*Pedro Domingos,João Pereira,Vasco Lopes,João Neves,David Semedo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoAT introduces inductive criminal bias via multi-agent reasoning, improving anomaly detection and classification in surveillance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the bias towards normality in Large Vision-Language Models for crime detection.

Method: Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent framework with an anomaly-focused classification layer.

Result: Improves F1-score by 11.8 p.p. in low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Conclusion: CoAT effectively enhances anomaly detection and classification in automated video surveillance.

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

### [6] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)
*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ improves 3D panoptic occupancy prediction by combining Gaussian-based depth and edge priors for better geometric consistency and boundary awareness, outperforming existing methods on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with precise geometry and spatial range in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction, limiting robust panoptic separation.

Method: HyGE-Occ uses a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance geometric consistency and boundary awareness.

Result: HyGE-Occ outperforms existing methods on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed HyGE-Occ framework addresses geometric and boundary challenges in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

### [7] [Widget2Code: From Visual Widgets to UI Code via Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19918)
*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Widget2Code, addressing the underexplored task of generating code for app widgets from UI images. It benchmarks multimodal LLMs and proposes a baseline with improved perceptual understanding and code generation, supported by WidgetFactory infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces lacking accessible markup, unlike web or mobile UIs. Prior work focuses largely on the latter, leaving widgets underexplored.

Method: The authors develop a baseline combining perceptual understanding (widget design principles, icon retrieval) and structured code generation (WidgetFactory infrastructure with WidgetDSL and adaptive rendering).

Result: Multimodal LLMs outperform specialized UI2Code methods but produce unreliable code. The proposed baseline enhances visual fidelity and establishes a unified infrastructure.

Conclusion: The paper advances Widget2Code research by introducing a benchmark, highlighting limitations of current methods, and proposing a robust baseline with WidgetFactory.

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

### [8] [Unified Brain Surface and Volume Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19928)
*S. Mazdak Abulnaga,Andrew Hoopes,Malte Hoffmann,Robin Magnet,Maks Ovsjanikov,Lilla Zöllei,John Guttag,Bruce Fischl,Adrian Dalca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeurAlign is a deep learning framework for joint cortical and subcortical brain MRI registration, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MRI registration methods treat volumetric and surface-based alignment separately, causing inconsistencies. NeurAlign addresses this by unifying both approaches.

Method: NeurAlign uses a unified volume-and-surface representation with an intermediate spherical coordinate space to align cortical and subcortical regions. Deep learning ensures geometric coherence.

Result: NeurAlign improves Dice scores by up to 7 points, maintains regular deformation fields, and is significantly faster than standard methods.

Conclusion: NeurAlign offers superior accuracy, fast inference, and simplicity, setting a new standard for joint brain MRI registration.

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

### [9] [Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941)
*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), suggesting Vision Transformers (ViTs) can be rewritten with fewer recurrent blocks. Empirical results show successful approximation (96% accuracy with 2 blocks) and reveal dynamical interpretability insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational structure of ViTs and determine if their depth can be characterized as a well-structured flow, aiming to simplify and interpret their dynamics.

Method: Proposes BRH and trains block-recurrent surrogates (Raptor) of pretrained ViTs, analyzing representational similarity and recurrent structure. Validates through empirical testing and dynamical interpretability.

Result: Demonstrates ViTs admit block-recurrent structure (96% accuracy with 2 blocks), identifies phases of reusable computation, and reveals dynamical properties like class-dependent convergence and low-rank updates.

Conclusion: ViTs exhibit a compact recurrent program, enabling simplified analysis via dynamical systems and highlighting low-complexity normative solutions.

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

### [10] [SE360: Semantic Edit in 360$^\circ$ Panoramas via Hierarchical Data Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19943)
*Haoyi Zhong,Fang-Lue Zhang,Andrew Chalmers,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SE360 is a new framework for editing objects in 360° panoramas using a coarse-to-fine data generation pipeline and a Transformer-based diffusion model, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with implausible results in 360° panoramas, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: A novel coarse-to-fine data generation pipeline using VLM and adaptive projection, followed by a two-stage refinement strategy and Transformer-based diffusion model.

Result: SE360 achieves better visual quality and semantic accuracy than current methods.

Conclusion: SE360 provides an effective and flexible solution for object editing in 360° panoramas.

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

### [11] [How Much 3D Do Video Foundation Models Encode?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19949)
*Zixuan Huang,Xiang Li,Zhaoyang Lv,James M. Rehg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on large video datasets develop natural 3D understanding. It introduces a framework to measure 3D awareness in VidFMs and finds that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit strong 3D understanding, even surpassing specialized 3D models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if pretraining on vast video data leads to emergent 3D understanding in VidFMs, the study aims to quantify their 3D awareness.

Method: A model-agnostic framework is proposed to measure 3D awareness by estimating multiple 3D properties from VidFM features using shallow read-outs.

Result: The study reveals that top-tier video generation models demonstrate robust 3D understanding, sometimes exceeding expert models trained specifically for 3D tasks.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights for developing scalable 3D models and highlight the unexpected 3D awareness capabilities of VidFMs.

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

*Yuechen Yang,Junlin Guo,Yanfan Zhu,Jialin Yue,Junchao Zhu,Yu Wang,Shilin Zhao,Haichun Yang,Xingyi Guo,Jovan Tanevski,Laura Barisoni,Avi Z. Rosenberg,Yuankai Huo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HistoWAS is a computational framework linking tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes by augmenting conventional metrics with spatial features and performing mass univariate regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of tools to measure spatial interactions of tissue characteristics limits clinical relevance; HistoWAS aims to bridge this gap.

Method: HistoWAS integrates 30 topological/spatial features from GIS and performs mass univariate regression with statistical correction.

Result: Applied to 385 WSIs from 206 KPMP participants, HistoWAS analyzed 102 features (72 conventional and 30 spatial).

Conclusion: HistoWAS successfully links tissue micro-architecture to clinical outcomes, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

### [13] [A Novel CNN Gradient Boosting Ensemble for Guava Disease Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19989)
*Tamim Ahasan Rijon,Yeasin Arafath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ensemble model combining CNN and Gradient Boosting Machine to detect guava diseases (Healthy, Fruit Flies, Anthracnose) with ~99.99% accuracy, using a dataset from Bangladesh.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing guava production is vital for Bangladesh's economy, and early disease detection can mitigate losses caused by Anthracnose and fruit flies.

Method: Utilizes CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques, specifically proposing an ensemble model (CNN-ML cascade with Gradient Boosting Machine).

Result: Achieves ~99.99% classification accuracy for guava disease detection.

Conclusion: The CNN-ML framework is effective for real-time agricultural monitoring, offering high-accuracy disease detection.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

### [14] [A Dual-Branch Local-Global Framework for Cross-Resolution Land Cover Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19990)
*Peng Gao,Ke Li,Di Wang,Yongshan Zhu,Yiming Zhang,Xuemei Luo,Yifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDTM is a dual-branch weakly supervised framework for cross-resolution land cover mapping, combining diffusion-based local refinement and transformer-based global reasoning to address noisy supervision issues and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weakly supervised methods struggle with coarse-to-fine resolution alignment, leading to degraded accuracy in land cover mapping.

Method: DDTM uses a dual-branch approach: a diffusion-based branch refines local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch ensures long-range contextual consistency. A pseudo-label confidence module reduces noise.

Result: DDTM achieves 66.52% mIoU on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: DDTM effectively addresses cross-resolution challenges, offering a robust solution for weakly supervised land cover mapping.

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods. The code is available at https://github.com/gpgpgp123/DDTM.

TL;DR: MIVA is a lightweight sub-network for pre-trained DMs that efficiently learns motion patterns from minimal data, enabling precise motion control without extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of DMs in image animation, such as data scarcity and poor generalization to novel motion patterns.

Method: Introduces Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a scalable sub-network trained on small datasets (~10 samples) to capture specific motion patterns.

Result: MIVA achieves precise motion control and high-quality generation, outperforming models trained on larger datasets.

Conclusion: MIVA offers a scalable and efficient solution for motion control in image animation with DMs.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

Conclusion: This dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection, enabling fair comparisons and zero-shot transfer to new environments.

Abstract: Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments.

*Zepeng Xin,Kaiyu Li,Luodi Chen,Wanchen Li,Yuchen Xiao,Hui Qiao,Weizhan Zhang,Deyu Meng,Xiangyong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaSeRS is a large-scale dataset addressing complex language-guided segmentation in RS images, and SegEarth-R2 is an MLLM improving object localization and segmentation flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models fail in complex geospatial scenarios, limiting real-world applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring.

Method: LaSeRS dataset captures hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning, and linguistic variability. SegEarth-R2 introduces spatial attention supervision and flexible segmentation queries.

Result: SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and benchmarks, setting a new baseline for geospatial segmentation.

Conclusion: LaSeRS and SegEarth-R2 advance complex language-guided segmentation in RS, addressing gaps left by oversimplified datasets.

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.

### [18] [A Contextual Analysis of Driver-Facing and Dual-View Video Inputs for Distraction Detection in Naturalistic Driving Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20025)
*Anthony Dontoh,Stephanie Ivey,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage can improve distraction detection accuracy, but performance gains depend on the architecture. SlowOnly-R50 improved by 9.8% with dual-view inputs, while SlowFast-R50 dropped by 7.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distracted driving detection models overlook environmental context, which may influence driving behavior. This study investigates whether adding road-facing views improves accuracy.

Method: Benchmarked three spatiotemporal action recognition architectures (SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, SlowOnly-R50) using synchronized dual-camera recordings under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view.

Result: SlowOnly-R50 improved by 9.8% with dual-view inputs, while SlowFast-R50 accuracy dropped by 7.2%. Contextual inputs improve detection but depend on architecture.

Conclusion: Simply adding visual context isn't sufficient; architecture must support multi-view integration. Future multimodal driver monitoring systems need fusion-aware design.

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

*Ziwei Qin,Xuhui Song,Deqing Huang,Na Qin,Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPI-GNN is a novel graph neural network framework designed to improve multimodal medical diagnosis by dynamically learning patient-specific graphs from disentangled feature subspaces, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing graph neural networks in medical diagnosis, which rely on static, indiscriminate graphs, thereby failing to capture patient-specific pathological relationships effectively.

Method: MAPI-GNN introduces a multi-dimensional discriminator to uncover latent graph-aware patterns, dynamically constructs activation graphs from disentangled feature subspaces, and aggregates these graphs using a relational fusion engine.

Result: Experiments on over 1300 patient samples across diverse tasks show that MAPI-GNN significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MAPI-GNN effectively addresses the limitations of static graphs in medical diagnosis by dynamically modeling patient-specific relationships, leading to superior diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Lin Li,Jiahui Li,Jiaming Lei,Jun Xiao,Feifei Shao,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2em introduces hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings for compositional zero-shot learning to address limitations of Euclidean methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods neglect hierarchical structures in CZSL, limiting scalability and generalization in large-scale taxonomies.

Method: H2em uses hyperbolic geometry with dual learning objectives (Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss and Discriminative Alignment Loss) and Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention.

Result: H2em outperforms existing methods in closed-world and open-world CZSL benchmarks.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic embeddings effectively model hierarchical structures, improving generalization and scalability for real-world CZSL.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

### [21] [VALLR-Pin: Dual-Decoding Visual Speech Recognition for Mandarin with Pinyin-Guided LLM Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20032)
*Chang Sun,Dongliang Xie,Bo Qin,Hong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALLR-Pin is a two-stage framework extending VALLR for Mandarin lip-reading, combining character and Pinyin predictions with LLM-based ambiguity resolution and fine-tuning for error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mandarin poses unique challenges for visual speech recognition due to ambiguous visemes and prevalent homophones, requiring innovative solutions for accurate transcription.

Method: The framework uses a shared video encoder with dual decoders for character and Pinyin predictions, leverages LLMs for ambiguity resolution, and fine-tunes LLMs on synthetic noisy examples.

Result: Integrating visual, phonetic, and linguistic context improves Mandarin lip-reading accuracy by addressing homophone-induced errors.

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin effectively combines multi-task learning and LLM refinement to enhance Mandarin lip-reading performance.

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashLips is a fast, mask-free lip-sync system with two stages: latent-space editing and audio-to-pose prediction, achieving high quality at 100+ FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to decouple lip control from rendering for real-time performance without explicit masks, matching SOTA quality.

Method: Stage 1 uses a latent-space editor for deterministic reconstruction; Stage 2 employs an audio-to-pose transformer for lip-sync.

Result: Achieves 100+ FPS on a single GPU with high perceptual quality, outperforming larger models.

Conclusion: FlashLips combines simplicity, speed, and quality, making it practical for real-time applications.

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

*Nguyen Lam Phu Quy,Pham Phu Hoa,Tran Chi Nguyen,Dao Sy Duy Minh,Nguyen Hoang Minh Ngoc,Huynh Trung Kiet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal pipeline enhances image captions by integrating visual and textual knowledge, outperforming traditional methods in generating richer, context-aware descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, limiting their effectiveness in domains like journalism and education. Addressing this gap requires richer, more informative descriptions.

Method: The system retrieves similar images using BEIT-3 and SigLIP So-384, reranks them with ORB and SIFT, and extracts contextual information from articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model integrates this context with base captions from Instruct BLIP.

Result: Evaluated on OpenEvents v1, the approach produces significantly more informative captions than traditional methods.

Conclusion: The pipeline shows strong potential for applications needing deeper visual-textual understanding.

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend learned image codecs to machine perception while enabling fine granular scalability, addressing gaps in progressive compression for machine-oriented tasks.

Method: Proposes PICM-Net, a trit-plane coding-based progressive codec, analyzing latent prioritization strategies and incorporating an adaptive decoding controller for dynamic inference adjustments.

Result: Achieves efficient progressive transmission and maintains high downstream classification performance, validating the codec's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression, balancing adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

*Jinyoung Choi,Youngchae Kwon,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRSN improves fashion style classification by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations, achieving significant accuracy boosts on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in large visual variations within styles and similarities between styles, requiring analysis of global and item-specific features.

Method: IRSN uses item region pooling (IRP) and gated feature fusion (GFF) alongside a dual-backbone architecture combining domain-specific and general feature extractors.

Result: IRSN improved accuracy by 6.9-14.5% on FashionStyle14 and 7.6-15.1% on ShowniqV3, outperforming baselines in capturing style differences.

Conclusion: IRSN effectively enhances fashion style classification by leveraging item-specific and global features, validated by performance gains and visualization.

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how activation functions and optimizers impact Human Activity Recognition (HAR) performance, finding ConvLSTM with Adam or RMSprop optimal for healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the understudied effects of activation functions and optimizers on HAR performance, especially in healthcare contexts.

Method: Tested combinations of ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh activation functions with SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad optimizers using BiLSTM and ConvLSTM on HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets.

Result: ConvLSTM with Adam or RMSprop achieved 99% accuracy, outperforming BiLSTM (60-98%).

Conclusion: ConvLSTM with specific optimizers is superior for HAR in healthcare, offering insights for real-world system optimization.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the imbalance between complex LiDAR point cloud distributions and simple control signals for realistic autonomous driving simulation.

Method: Transforms text, images, and point clouds into unified 3D layouts (semantic/depth signals), then uses a rangemap-based ControlNet for generation.

Result: Achieves high-quality, versatile LiDAR point cloud generation from diverse inputs (text, images, sketches).

Conclusion: LiDARDraft enables 'simulation from scratch' with superior controllability and realism for autonomous driving environments.

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

*Thanh-Tung Le,Tuan Pham,Tung Nguyen,Deying Kong,Xiaohui Xie,Stephan Mandt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining deterministic and stochastic methods improves novel view synthesis by balancing speed and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either blur unobserved areas (deterministic) or are computationally expensive (stochastic). The aim is to unify their strengths for efficient, high-quality rendering.

Method: Uses a bidirectional transformer to encode multi-view tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, with two lightweight heads: a regression head for well-constrained areas and a diffusion head for occluded regions. Trained end-to-end with joint losses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time significantly compared to fully generative methods.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively balances realism and efficiency in novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-modal attention network combines radar and thermal data for bridge deck inspection, improving defect detection accuracy and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated inspection techniques are needed to address the limitations of visual assessment and single-modal approaches in civil infrastructure.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-modal attention network with temporal attention for radar, spatial attention for thermal data, and cross-modal fusion. Uncertainty is quantified using Monte Carlo dropout and variance estimation.

Result: The approach outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC, with ablation studies highlighting cross-modal attention's importance. However, it struggles under extreme class imbalance.

Conclusion: The architecture is effective for typical scenarios, but extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. The system is efficient for real-time deployment.

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDAVS improves Audio-Visual Segmentation by disentangling audio semantics and aligning modalities better, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVS methods struggle with multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, causing biases toward louder/larger objects and overlooking others.

Method: DDAVS uses learnable queries and an audio prototype memory bank for disentangled semantics, plus delayed bidirectional alignment for robust multimodal interaction.

Result: DDAVS outperforms others on AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks, handling single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios effectively.

Conclusion: DDAVS demonstrates strong generalization and effectiveness in real-world AVS conditions.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers (ViTs) struggle with quadratic attention costs and redundant computations, hindering deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning methods are isolated and heuristic-driven, often sacrificing accuracy.

Method: HEART-ViT uses Hessian-vector products to estimate curvature-weighted sensitivities for tokens and attention heads, enabling principled pruning under loss budgets. It combines token and head pruning for optimal efficiency.

Result: On ImageNet benchmarks, HEART-ViT reduces FLOPs by up to 49.4%, lowers latency by 36%, and increases throughput by 46%, while matching or surpassing baseline accuracy. Real-world deployments on edge devices confirm practical gains.

Conclusion: HEART-ViT bridges theory and practice as the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework for ViTs, preserving accuracy and enhancing edge efficiency.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

*Niraj Prakash Kini,Shiau-Rung Tsai,Guan-Hsun Lin,Wen-Hsiao Peng,Ching-Wen Ma,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: milliMamba is a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that addresses sparse radar signals by modeling spatio-temporal dependencies with a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder and Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave radar provides privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant HPE but suffers from sparse signals due to specular reflection. Robust feature extraction is challenging.

Method: Uses a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder for efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder to predict joint coordinates. Incorporates velocity loss for motion smoothness.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP on TransHuPR and HuPR datasets, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Conclusion: milliMamba effectively leverages spatio-temporal modeling to infer missing joints and improve pose estimation performance in radar-based systems.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

### [33] [Enhancing annotations for 5D apple pose estimation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20148)
*Robert van de Ven,Trim Bresilla,Bram Nelissen,Ard Nieuwenhuizen,Eldert J. van Henten,Gert Kootstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting for orchard scene reconstruction, simplifying annotations and automating label projection to train pose estimation models, reducing manual annotations by 99.6% while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating tasks in orchards is difficult due to environmental variations and occlusions, particularly for apple pose estimation where key points like the calyx are often occluded. Existing methods rely on these points for annotations, making the process time-consuming.

Method: A novel pipeline combining 3D Gaussian Splatting for scene reconstruction, simplified annotations, automated label projection, and pose estimation training/evaluation. Training focused on fruits with ≤95% occlusion.

Result: 105 manual annotations generated 28,191 training labels (99.6% reduction). Best performance achieved with ≤95% occluded fruits (F1 score: 0.927 original images, 0.970 rendered). Least occluded fruits had better position estimation.

Conclusion: The pipeline significantly reduces annotation effort without compromising performance. However, orientation estimation remains a challenge, suggesting further improvements are needed.

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

*Grega Šuštar,Jer Pelhan,Alan Lukežič,Matej Kristan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi is a latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that improves object counting accuracy, especially in dense regions, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately counting objects in dense regions with small objects, especially in low-shot scenarios, motivates the development of CoDi. Existing methods either lack localization or struggle with large object counts.

Method: CoDi uses a latent diffusion-based approach with an exemplar-based conditioning module to adjust object prototypes in the denoising network, enabling precise object location estimation via density maps.

Result: CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 15%, 13%, and 10% MAE in few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios on FSC benchmark, and by 44% MAE on MCAC benchmark.

Conclusion: CoDi sets a new state-of-the-art for low-shot object counting by effectively addressing localization and scalability challenges through its innovative diffusion-based approach.

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark NL-DIR is introduced for document image retrieval using natural language queries, addressing limitations of existing methods which rely on coarse semantic categories. The dataset includes 41K document images with fine-grained semantic queries, evaluated using mainstream models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document image retrieval (DIR) methods fail to handle fine-grained textual queries effectively in real-world scenarios, prompting the need for a more versatile benchmark.

Method: The NL-DIR benchmark uses natural language queries paired with 41K document images. Evaluations include zero-shot and fine-tuning of contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free VDU models, with a two-stage retrieval method for efficiency.

Result: The proposed NL-DIR benchmark provides a robust dataset and evaluation framework, showing potential improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: NL-DIR offers a valuable resource for advancing vision-language models in document retrieval, fostering research opportunities in visual document understanding.

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMoE, a vision foundation model distilled from SigLIP2 and DINOv3, highlighting key techniques like asymmetric distillation, token-balanced batching, and hierarchical data sampling for improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models, aiming to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts (AMoE) with asymmetric distillation loss, token-balanced batching, and hierarchical data sampling.

Result: Achieves efficient knowledge transfer, stable representation learning, and superior sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Combining these techniques enables training at lower cost, demonstrated by OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

### [37] [Generative Latent Coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20194)
*Zhaoyang Jia,Jiahao Li,Bin Li,Houqiang Li,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Latent Coding (GLC), a method for image compression using latent space transformation for better realism and fidelity at low bitrates, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image compression methods struggle with high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrates due to pixel-space distortion misalignment with human perception.

Method: GLC performs transform coding in the latent space of a VQ-VAE, uses a hyper module to reduce bit cost, and employs code-prediction-based supervision for semantic consistency.

Result: GLC achieves high visual quality at ultra-low bitrates (0.04 bpp for natural images, 0.01 bpp for facial images) and matches FID scores with 45% fewer bits than MS-ILLM.

Conclusion: GLC's generative latent space enhances compression quality and enables applications like image restoration and style transfer, demonstrating its superiority over pixel-space methods.

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JDPNet tackles coupled degradations in underwater images using a joint degradation processing network, balancing performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from complex, coupled degradations that existing methods struggle to address due to nonlinear interactions.

Method: Introduces JDPNet with a joint feature-mining module, probabilistic bootstrap distribution, and AquaBalanceLoss for unified degradation processing.

Result: Outperforms on six public and two new datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with balanced efficiency.

Conclusion: JDPNet effectively addresses coupled degradations, offering improved performance and practical tradeoffs.

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiteFusion, a multi-modal 3D detector that uses LiDAR data as geometric enhancement for camera-based detection, eliminating reliance on complex LiDAR backbones and improving robustness and deployment flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal 3D detectors rely heavily on LiDAR and complex architectures, limiting robustness and deployment versatility. LiteFusion aims to simplify this by treating LiDAR as complementary to camera data.

Method: LiteFusion integrates LiDAR points into image features in quaternion space, preserving orthogonal constraints and creating compact cross-modal embeddings without a dedicated LiDAR backbone.

Result: On the nuScenes dataset, LiteFusion boosts vision-based detector performance by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with minimal parameter increase (1.1%), maintaining strong performance even without LiDAR.

Conclusion: LiteFusion offers a lightweight, deployment-friendly solution for 3D object detection, enhancing robustness and performance across diverse scenarios without relying on LiDAR-specific architectures.

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IndicDLP and UED-mini datasets to address gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity in existing document layout datasets, particularly for Indic languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack fine-grained labels, multilingual diversity, and adequate coverage for Indic documents, hindering robust model training and inclusive document understanding.

Method: IndicDLP is introduced as a large-scale dataset spanning 11 Indic languages and 12 document domains, supplemented by UED-mini for pretraining. Fine-tuning English models on IndicDLP is evaluated.

Result: Fine-tuning on IndicDLP significantly improves performance, and the models generalize well beyond Indic layouts, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: IndicDLP bridges gaps in dataset scale, diversity, and granularity, advancing inclusive document understanding and digitization.

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP), a framework for unified HSI restoration that uses spatial-spectral degradation metrics instead of predefined degradation priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HSI restoration methods rely on explicit degradation priors, which are hard to obtain due to complex real-world degradations.

Method: DAMP introduces spatial-spectral degradation metrics as prompts and a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) for dynamic feature extraction.

Result: DAMP outperforms existing methods and shows strong generalization across natural and remote sensing HSI datasets.

Conclusion: DAMP offers adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration for diverse degradations without needing predefined priors.

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiCoR-Seg, a Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation, addressing inter-class similarity and intra-class variability challenges through heatmap-driven bidirectional information synergy and hierarchical supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability in HRSS necessitate a method to inject discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level features, avoiding blurred boundaries and class confusion.

Method: BiCoR-Seg uses a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS) for bidirectional flow between feature maps and class embeddings, incorporates hierarchical supervision via interpretable heatmaps, and employs a Fisher Discriminative Loss for embedding representation.

Result: Experiments on LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets show BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance with enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: BiCoR-Seg effectively addresses HRSS challenges, offering superior performance and interpretability, with publicly available code.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of synthetic media manipulations threatens information integrity, necessitating efficient detection methods with minimal annotated data.

Method: LADLE-MM combines unimodal branches with multimodal embeddings from BLIP, optimizing performance under constrained resources.

Result: It achieves competitive performance on DGM4 and VERITE benchmarks, even outperforming models with more parameters.

Conclusion: LADLE-MM demonstrates robustness and generalization, proving effective for misinformation detection with limited resources.

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework, to improve weakly-supervised camouflaged object detection by enhancing pseudo labeling and addressing scribble annotation bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSCOD methods underperform due to unreliable pseudo masks from general-purpose models and scribble annotation bias, limiting semantic understanding and global structure capture.

Method: ${D}^{3}$ETOR includes Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling (adaptive entropy-driven sampling and multi-agent debate) and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing (FADeNet for feature fusion and dynamic supervision reweighting).

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, narrowing the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD.

Conclusion: ${D}^{3}$ETOR effectively improves WSCOD by combining enhanced pseudo labeling and debiasing techniques, leveraging both pseudo masks and scribble semantics.

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

*Akshat Dubey,Aleksandar Anžel,Bahar İlgen,Georges Hattab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning advancements improve medical imaging but complicate model interpretability. SHAP helps but is unstable under uncertainty. This study uses Dirichlet sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify SHAP uncertainty in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging lack explainability due to complexity. SHAP provides interpretable visualizations but struggles with uncertainty.

Method: Proposes a framework using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify uncertainty in SHAP explanations.

Result: Evaluated on diverse medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, quality, and modalities.

Conclusion: The framework effectively quantifies uncertainty in SHAP explanations for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

*Ji-Hoon Kim,Junseok Ahn,Doyeop Kwak,Joon Son Chung,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAVID is a unified framework generating synchronized interactive videos and conversational speech from text and images, addressing gaps in multimodal human-like conversation synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the isolation between talking/listening head generation and speech synthesis, capturing the multimodal nature of human conversation.

Method: TAVID integrates face and speech generation via cross-modal mappers (motion and speaker mappers) for bidirectional audio-visual interaction.

Result: Evaluated across realism, responsiveness, fluency, and speech quality, TAVID proves effective in all dimensions.

Conclusion: TAVID successfully synchronizes interactive face and speech generation, advancing multimodal conversational systems.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KeyTailor introduces a keyframe-driven framework for video virtual try-on, enhancing garment dynamics and background consistency while avoiding DiT modifications. It leverages a new high-quality dataset, ViT-HD, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video virtual try-on methods struggle with fine-grained garment dynamics, background integrity, and computational costs, exacerbated by limited dataset quality.

Method: KeyTailor uses keyframe-driven modules (garment details enhancement and background optimization) to inject enriched details into DiT blocks, guided by instruction-filtered keyframes.

Result: KeyTailor achieves superior garment fidelity and background integrity compared to baselines, validated on the ViT-HD dataset.

Conclusion: KeyTailor effectively addresses challenges in video virtual try-on by leveraging keyframes and a high-quality dataset, offering improved performance without DiT modifications.

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

### [48] [CRAFT: Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning for Multimodal Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20362)
*V. Kovalev,A. Kuvshinov,A. Buzovkin,D. Pokidov,D. Timonin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT introduces structured reasoning to improve text-to-image generation by decomposing prompts into visual questions, verifying images, and applying targeted edits, achieving better accuracy and reliability with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving text-to-image generation lack interpretability and control. CRAFT aims to address this by adopting structured reasoning paradigms from large language models.

Method: CRAFT decomposes prompts into visual questions, verifies images using a vision-language model, and iteratively edits prompts with an LLM agent until constraints are met.

Result: CRAFT improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations across models, especially lightweight ones, with negligible overhead.

Conclusion: Structured, constraint-driven reasoning at inference time enhances the reliability of multimodal generative models.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

### [50] [SmartSplat: Feature-Smart Gaussians for Scalable Compression of Ultra-High-Resolution Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20377)
*Linfei Li,Lin Zhang,Zhong Wang,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmartSplat is a novel GS-based image compression framework addressing ultra-high-resolution challenges by balancing compression ratio and fidelity using adaptive sampling and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI has increased demand for efficient compression of ultra-high-resolution images, but existing methods fail to balance compression and quality.

Method: SmartSplat uses Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling, Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling, and Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling to optimize spatial layout, scale, and color initialization.

Result: SmartSplat outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DIV8K and a 16K dataset, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression.

Conclusion: SmartSplat offers scalable and practical solutions for ultra-high-resolution image compression, surpassing current limits.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lif314/SmartSplat.

### [51] [DETACH : Decomposed Spatio-Temporal Alignment for Exocentric Video and Ambient Sensors with Staged Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20409)
*Junho Yoon,Jaemo Jung,Hyunju Kim,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using exocentric video and ambient sensors as a non-intrusive alternative to egocentric video with wearable sensors for human action recognition. It introduces DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework, to address limitations of global alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods relying on egocentric video and wearable sensors suffer from user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability issues. The authors propose exocentric video and ambient sensors as a practical alternative.

Method: The proposed DETACH framework decomposes spatio-temporal features explicitly to preserve local details. It uses sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering for semantic grounding and employs a two-stage alignment approach: spatial correspondence via mutual supervision and temporal alignment via a weighted contrastive loss.

Result: Experiments on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets show significant improvements over baseline methods adapted from egocentric-wearable settings.

Conclusion: DETACH effectively addresses the limitations of global alignment in exocentric-ambient settings, offering a scalable and privacy-friendly solution for human action recognition.

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets. The system performance was evaluated using established skin lesion detection metrics, yielding impressive results.

*Ji Song,Xing Wang,Jianguo Wu,Xiaowei Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TBSD, a method for efficient anomaly detection in textured images, addressing limitations like misidentification and robustness in conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient anomaly detection is crucial in manufacturing systems using high-dimensional data like images, but current methods struggle with textured defect images due to misidentification and dataset dependency.

Method: Proposes TBSD, involving texture basis learning for quasi-periodic pattern extraction and anomaly detection using the basis as prior knowledge.

Result: TBSD outperforms benchmarks with fewer errors, reduced training data needs, and better anomaly detection performance in simulations and real-world data.

Conclusion: TBSD is a robust solution for anomaly detection in textured images, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Incorporating physically inferred forces into motion understanding pipelines enhances performance across gait recognition, action recognition, and video captioning tasks, showing consistent gains in accuracy and semantic richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook physical cues like joint actuation forces, which are fundamental in biomechanics, prompting exploration of their impact on motion understanding.

Method: By integrating force cues into established motion understanding pipelines, the study evaluates their effect on gait recognition, action recognition, and video captioning across multiple benchmarks.

Result: Performance improvements were observed across all tasks, e.g., +0.87% gait recognition accuracy on CASIA-B, +2.00% action recognition on Penn Action, and +0.029 ROUGE-L score in video captioning.

Conclusion: Force cues significantly complement visual and kinematic features, particularly under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-assisted graphic design tools struggle with small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts. UTDesign addresses these limitations.

Method: Proposes a DiT-based text style transfer model and extends it into a conditional text generation framework, integrating pre-trained T2I models and an MLLM-based layout planner.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in stylistic consistency and text accuracy, surpassing open-source methods and competing with proprietary solutions.

Conclusion: UTDesign offers a robust solution for automated text-to-design tasks, with code and data publicly available for further research and application.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TLDR: The study evaluates RGB and LWIR fusion for UAS-based landmine detection, finding YOLOv11 optimal (86.8% mAP) with 10-30% thermal fusion at 5-10m altitude. YOLOv11 trains faster but trades accuracy with RF-DETR. Multi-temporal datasets improve performance, and AT mines are detected more accurately than AP mines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Landmines cause significant humanitarian harm, with millions deployed globally. Enhancing detection methods is critical to reducing casualties.

Method: The study uses adaptive RGB and LWIR fusion with YOLO architectures (v8, v10, v11) on 114 test images, generating 35,640 evaluations. It compares YOLOv11 with RF-DETR, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet, assessing accuracy and training efficiency.

Result: YOLOv11 achieved 86.8% mAP with optimal thermal fusion (10-30%) at 5-10m altitude. It trained 17.7x faster than RF-DETR. Multi-temporal datasets outperformed season-specific ones by 1.8-9.6%. AT mines were detected better (61.9%) than AP mines (19.2%).

Conclusion: YOLOv11 offers a balance of accuracy and efficiency for landmine detection. Future work should explore thermal contrast for buried mines across soil types.

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges in motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in dynamic scenes with fast motion, multi-object interaction, and occlusion.

Method: SirenPose uses physics-inspired constraints, high-frequency signal modeling, graph neural networks, and an expanded UniKPT dataset for keypoint relationships.

Result: SirenPose reduces FVD by 17.8%, FID by 28.7%, improves LPIPS by 6.0%, and outperforms MoSCA and Monst3R in metrics like temporal consistency and pose accuracy.

Conclusion: SirenPose excels in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction, handling rapid motion and complex dynamics with superior performance and geometric accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos. Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness. In pose estimation, SirenPose outperforms Monst3R with lower absolute trajectory error as well as reduced translational and rotational relative pose error, highlighting its effectiveness in handling rapid motion, complex dynamics, and physically plausible reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignPose is a multi-view RGB method for 6D object pose estimation that avoids object-specific training and outperforms existing methods on industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of single-view RGB methods (depth ambiguity, clutter, occlusions) and improving generalization in multi-view pose estimation.

Method: AlignPose aggregates multi-view RGB data, uses feature-metric refinement to optimize consistent world-frame poses, and requires no object-specific training.

Result: Outperforms other methods on YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, and HouseCat6D datasets, especially in industrial settings with multiple views.

Conclusion: AlignPose effectively addresses multi-view pose estimation challenges without needing object-specific training or symmetry annotations.

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

TL;DR: MTIF proposes a multi-grained text-guided image fusion method to enhance fusion quality using hierarchical text descriptions and cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with fine-grained details and precise cross-modal alignment when using coarse-grained textual descriptions for image fusion.

Method: MTIF introduces multi-grained text descriptions, hierarchical cross-modal modulation, granular supervision signals, and saliency-driven enrichment for better fusion.

Result: MTIF outperforms previous methods in multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Conclusion: MTIF effectively addresses limitations in text-guided image fusion by leveraging multi-grained text descriptions and hierarchical alignment.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Jing Yang,Yijia Fan,Pengtao Xie,Jian Wang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVLM is a text-guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to queries, achieving efficient, lossless compression while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token reduction methods often ignore textual queries or rely on unstable attention maps, leading to degraded semantic alignment. FlashVLM addresses this by dynamically adapting visual tokens to queries.

Method: FlashVLM computes cross-modal similarity between image tokens and text embeddings, combines it with visual saliency, and uses diversity-preserving partitions to retain essential tokens.

Result: FlashVLM prunes up to 77.8% of visual tokens, surpassing unpruned baselines and maintaining 92.8% accuracy at 94.4% compression. It achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: FlashVLM offers robust, efficient token reduction for VLMs, maintaining accuracy and generalization across benchmarks.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in imitation learning for driving policies due to misalignment between expert demonstrations and student observations. It proposes practical interventions to narrow these gaps, achieving state-of-the-art performance in CARLA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the gap between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations in simulation, which hinders robust closed-loop performance in imitation learning.

Method: The authors analyze misalignments like visibility differences and navigational intent underspecification, then modify the student policy (TransFuser v6) to address these issues. They also integrate perception supervision into a sim-to-real pipeline.

Result: TFv6 achieves 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubles prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. It also shows consistent gains on NAVSIM and Waymo benchmarks.

Conclusion: By narrowing expert-student gaps and integrating perception supervision, the proposed method significantly improves driving policy performance in simulation and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

TL;DR: DiTracker, leveraging video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), outperforms existing methods in point tracking tasks by enhancing temporal coherence and handling dynamic motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for point tracking lack temporal coherence and fail under challenging conditions, prompting the need for a robust solution using video DiTs.

Method: DiTracker adapts video DiTs via query-key attention matching, LoRA tuning, and cost fusion with ResNet, improving tracking reliability.

Result: DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on ITTO and TAP-Vid benchmarks, even with smaller training batches.

Conclusion: Video DiTs serve as an effective foundation for point tracking, validated by DiTracker's superior performance.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

TL;DR: FedPOD optimizes federated learning by improving efficiency and reducing communication costs, addressing limitations of FedPIDAvg like outlier exclusion and round dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance federated learning efficiency and flexibility while overcoming FedPIDAvg's drawbacks, such as outlier exclusion and dependency on previous rounds.

Method: FedPOD includes outliers, removes round dependency, and calculates validation loss per round. It uses a POD-like structure for flexible scaling.

Result: FedPOD matches FedPIDAvg's performance (Dice scores: 0.78 WT, 0.71 ET, 0.72 TC; convergence score: 0.74) while improving efficiency and flexibility.

Conclusion: FedPOD shows promise for federated learning with its efficiency, flexibility, and performance improvements, inspired by Kubernetes' POD design.

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: L-IVA and ORCA introduce goal-directed planning and active intelligence in video avatars, outperforming traditional methods by integrating robust state tracking and hierarchical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video avatar methods lack genuine agency and long-term goal pursuit. L-IVA and ORCA aim to bridge this gap by enabling autonomous, adaptive interaction in stochastic environments.

Method: ORCA uses a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) for state tracking and a hierarchical dual-system architecture (System 2 for strategic reasoning, System 1 for precise action translation) to achieve active intelligence.

Result: ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, demonstrating reliable multi-step task completion.

Conclusion: ORCA advances video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

TL;DR: SpatialTree introduces a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy for spatial abilities in MLLMs, evaluates them across 4 levels, and reveals interdependencies and transfer dynamics. Auto-think RL improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and systematically scale spatial abilities in MLLMs by organizing them into a progressive hierarchy inspired by cognitive science.

Method: Developed SpatialTree, a hierarchical benchmark with 4 levels (L1-L4), evaluated mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities, and tested transfer dynamics via fine-tuning and RL strategies.

Result: Higher-level spatial skills are correlated, while L1 skills are orthogonal. Negative transfer occurs within L1, but strong cross-level transfer exists. Auto-think RL improves all levels.

Conclusion: SpatialTree offers a framework for scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs, demonstrating hierarchical interdependencies and proposing effective training strategies.

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: SemanticGen introduces a two-stage video generation process using semantic space for faster convergence and computational efficiency compared to traditional VAE latent space methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generative models are slow and computationally expensive for long videos due to direct modeling of low-level tokens in VAE space.

Method: SemanticGen uses a two-stage diffusion process: first generating semantic features for global planning, then adding high-frequency details via VAE latents.

Result: The method achieves faster convergence, computational efficiency, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in video quality.

Conclusion: Generating videos in semantic space improves efficiency and quality, making SemanticGen superior to existing methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an agentic framework using LLMs to extract structured oncology data from EHR notes, achieving high accuracy and reducing manual costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting structured oncology data from EHR notes is challenging due to variability and inconsistency, while manual methods are costly and existing automated approaches are limited.

Method: The study uses LLMs as reasoning agents with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis to extract data from unstructured oncology notes.

Result: The method achieved an average F1-score of 0.93, with critical variables surpassing 0.95, and reduced manual annotation costs with a 0.94 approval rate.

Conclusion: The framework is the first scalable, end-to-end LLM-based solution for structured oncology data extraction, demonstrating high performance and cost efficiency.

Abstract: Unstructured notes within the electronic health record (EHR) contain rich clinical information vital for cancer treatment decision making and research, yet reliably extracting structured oncology data remains challenging due to extensive variability, specialized terminology, and inconsistent document formats. Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale

*Kirk Vanacore,Rene F. Kizilcec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates six large language models (LLMs) on interpreting classroom transcripts using zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. Few-shot prompting improved performance, but results varied by instructional move and trade-offs between recall and false positives were noted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the baseline capabilities of LLMs in interpreting authentic educational scenarios without customization, as their adoption in educational technologies grows.

Method: Comparison of six LLMs on classifying instructional moves in classroom transcripts using zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. Performance was measured against expert-coded annotations.

Result: Few-shot prompting significantly improved performance (Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 for the best model), but improvements were uneven across instructional moves, with trade-offs between recall and false positives.

Conclusion: LLMs show meaningful yet limited capacity for interpreting instructional discourse. Prompt design enhances performance but does not overcome fundamental reliability limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational technologies for a variety of tasks, from generating instructional materials and assisting with assessment design to tutoring. While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based framework to quantify rhetorical style in ML papers, distinguishing it from substantive content. It finds that visionary framing predicts attention and notes a post-2023 rise in rhetorical strength, linked to LLM writing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about hype in ML papers by disentangling rhetorical style from substantive content, as bold language can be misleading if driven by style rather than strong results.

Method: A counterfactual framework using multiple LLM personas to generate writings from the same content, an LLM judge for pairwise comparisons, and aggregation via a Bradley-Terry model.

Result: Visionary framing predicts citations/media attention, and rhetorical strength rose sharply post-2023 due to LLM writing tools. The framework is reliable and aligns with human judgments.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively measure rhetorical style and improve scientific evaluation, offering insights into hype and attention dynamics in ML research.

Abstract: The rise of AI has fueled growing concerns about ``hype'' in machine learning papers, yet a reliable way to quantify rhetorical style independently of substantive content has remained elusive. Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.

TL;DR: The study examines tone biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) used in conversational systems, revealing systematic biases even in neutral responses. It combines dialogue synthesis with tone classification to measure and detect these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to uncover and address subtle tone biases in LLMs, which affect user trust, empathy, and fairness in AI interactions.

Method: The study created synthetic dialogue datasets (neutral and tonally guided) and used DistilBERT for tone labeling. Ensemble classifiers were trained to detect tone patterns.

Result: Ensemble models achieved high macro F1 scores (up to 0.92), confirming tone bias is systematic and measurable.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of addressing tone bias to ensure fair and trustworthy conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in conversational systems such as digital personal assistants, shaping how people interact with technology through language. While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.

TL;DR: ThinkARM uses Episode Theory to analyze reasoning steps in language models, revealing structural differences and dynamics in reasoning processes, such as exploration's role in correctness and efficiency methods' selective suppression of feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and analyze the cognitive structure and reasoning steps in large language models beyond surface-level statistics.

Method: Introduces ThinkARM, a framework abstracting reasoning traces into functional steps (Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify, etc.) applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models.

Result: Identifies reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models, with exploration as a critical branching step and efficiency methods suppressing evaluative feedback.

Conclusion: Episode-level representations explicitly reveal reasoning steps, enabling systematic analysis of reasoning structure and dynamics in language models.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly expose reasoning traces, yet their underlying cognitive structure and steps remain difficult to identify and analyze beyond surface-level statistics. We adopt Schoenfeld's Episode Theory as an inductive, intermediate-scale lens and introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that explicitly abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify, etc. When applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models, this abstraction reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models, which are not apparent from token-level views. We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses. Together, our results demonstrate that episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models.

TL;DR: Memory-T1 introduces a reinforcement learning framework for temporal reasoning in long dialogues, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with temporal reasoning in lengthy, noisy dialogues, impairing performance.

Method: Uses RL with a coarse-to-fine strategy: pruning dialogue history temporally/relevance, then selecting evidence sessions via RL guided by multi-level rewards.

Result: Achieves 67.0% on Time-Dialog benchmark (SOTA for open-source models), outperforming baselines and handling up to 128k tokens.

Conclusion: Memory-T1 effectively addresses temporal reasoning challenges in long dialogues, offering significant performance gains and robustness.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning over long, multi-session dialogues is a critical capability for conversational agents. However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextGSL, a novel graph-sequence learning model for inductive text classification, addressing limitations in existing GNN-based methods by incorporating diverse structural and sequential information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based text classification methods fail to fully utilize diverse structural relationships (co-occurrence, syntax, semantics) and neglect sequential information, limiting their ability to classify texts with new words or relations.

Method: The proposed TextGSL constructs a text-level graph with diverse edge types for word pairs and uses an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm. It also incorporates Transformer layers to capture sequential information.

Result: TextGSL outperforms strong baselines in accuracy across diverse benchmarking datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning discriminative text representations.

Conclusion: TextGSL successfully integrates diverse structural and sequential information, offering a superior solution for inductive text classification compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Text classification plays an important role in various downstream text-related tasks, such as sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and public opinion analysis. Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.

### [75] [ABBEL: LLM Agents Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20111)
*Aly Lidayan,Jakob Bjorner,Satvik Golechha,Kartik Goyal,Alane Suhr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ABBEL is a framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts in sequential tasks by using natural language belief states instead of full histories. RL post-training improves ABBEL's performance beyond full-context approaches while using less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational impracticality of keeping full interaction histories in long sequential decision-making tasks.

Method: ABBEL replaces interaction history with belief states (summaries). Agents update beliefs with observations and act on the posterior belief. RL is used post-training to improve belief quality and compression.

Result: ABBEL maintains near-constant memory use and generates interpretable beliefs, but suffers from error propagation. RL improves performance beyond full-context settings.

Conclusion: ABBEL, enhanced with RL, offers a scalable and interpretable solution for sequential decision-making, outperforming full-context methods in memory efficiency.

Abstract: As the length of sequential decision-making tasks increases, it becomes computationally impractical to keep full interaction histories in context. We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.

TL;DR: M$^3$KG-RAG improves multimodal RAG by addressing MMKG limitations and refining retrieval with GRASP, enhancing MLLMs' reasoning and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal RAG struggles due to limited MMKG coverage, weak multi-hop connectivity, and similarity-based retrieval issues.

Method: Proposes M$^3$KG-RAG with a multi-agent pipeline for constructing multi-hop MMKGs and GRASP for precise, relevance-filtered retrieval.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in multimodal benchmarks, boosting reasoning and grounding.

Conclusion: M$^3$KG-RAG effectively tackles multimodal RAG challenges, offering significant improvements.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently been extended to multimodal settings, connecting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vast corpora of external knowledge such as multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.

TL;DR: Introduces Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA) for iterative RAG systems, improving retrieval precision, reducing errors, and enhancing performance by aligning LLMs with retrieval sets before planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative RAG systems inefficiently decompose complex questions without leveraging corpus information, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes EKA, a module aligning LLMs with retrieval sets before planning, reducing unnecessary exploration during reasoning.

Result: EKA improves retrieval precision, reduces errors, and enhances efficiency across six standard RAG datasets.

Conclusion: EKA advances iterative RAG systems, highlighting the interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning frameworks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

TL;DR: RetroPrompt balances memorization and generalization by using a knowledge base and retrieval mechanism, outperforming traditional prompt learning in zero-shot and few-shot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prompt learning struggles with atypical instances and overfitting due to its parametric nature, limiting generalization.

Method: RetroPrompt decouples knowledge from memorization by integrating a retrieval mechanism with a public knowledge base during input, training, and inference stages.

Result: RetroPrompt shows superior performance in NLP and CV tasks, reducing reliance on rote memorization and improving generalization.

Conclusion: RetroPrompt effectively addresses the limitations of conventional prompt learning by enhancing contextual cues and balancing memorization with generalization.

Abstract: The pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) have become essential for facilitating large-scale multimodal learning. Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.

TL;DR: Fun-Audio-Chat addresses challenges in joint speech-text models by introducing efficient dual-resolution speech representations and a two-stage training approach, achieving competitive performance without large-scale pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing joint speech-text models suffer from temporal resolution mismatches, high computational costs, and catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. Fun-Audio-Chat aims to solve these issues.

Method: Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR) balance efficiency and quality, while Core-Cocktail Training mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Multi-Task DPO Training enhances robustness and understanding.

Result: Fun-Audio-Chat achieves competitive performance on Speech-to-Text, Speech-to-Speech, Audio Understanding, and more, ranking top among similar-scale models.

Conclusion: Fun-Audio-Chat effectively retains text LLM knowledge while improving audio capabilities, offering a scalable solution without extensive pre-training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo.

*Honglin Mu,Jinghao Liu,Kaiyang Wan,Rui Xing,Xiuying Chen,Timothy Baldwin,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) where 'adversarial instructions' can manipulate outputs. It benchmarks these attacks in resume screening, tests defenses, and finds training-time methods like FIDS outperform prompt-based defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to expose and mitigate vulnerabilities in LLMs caused by adversarial instructions, particularly in applications lacking defenses, such as resume screening.

Method: The study introduces a benchmark for assessing LLM vulnerabilities in resume screening and evaluates two defenses: prompt-based methods and FIDS (using LoRA adaptation).

Result: Attack success rates exceed 80% for some attack types. FIDS achieves a 15.4% attack reduction versus prompt-based defenses' 10.1%, with combined defenses reaching 26.3%.

Conclusion: Training-time defenses like FIDS are more effective than inference-time mitigations, balancing security and utility better.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at text comprehension and generation, making them ideal for automated tasks like code review and content moderation. However, our research identifies a vulnerability: LLMs can be manipulated by "adversarial instructions" hidden in input data, such as resumes or code, causing them to deviate from their intended task. Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase. The combined approach provides 26.3% attack reduction, demonstrating that training-time defenses outperform inference-time mitigations in both security and utility preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for detecting faithfulness hallucination in LLM outputs, ensuring reliability in applications like retrieval-augmented generation and summarization.

Method: FaithLens synthesizes training data with explanations, applies data filtering, fine-tunes the model, and optimizes it with rule-based reinforcement learning.

Result: FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3 across 12 diverse tasks while providing high-quality explanations.

Conclusion: FaithLens offers a balanced solution for hallucination detection, excelling in trustworthiness, efficiency, and effectiveness.

Abstract: Recognizing whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) contain faithfulness hallucination is crucial for real-world applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and summarization. In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3. Also, FaithLens can produce high-quality explanations, delivering a distinctive balance of trustworthiness, efficiency, and effectiveness.

TL;DR: A corpus of cross-lingual dialogues facilitated by speech translation was created for evaluating automatic systems. It includes transcripts, translations, and summaries. Automatic detection of misunderstandings was also tested, with Gemini achieving 77% recall and 47% precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate automatic speech translation systems by providing a realistic corpus and exploring methods to detect misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings.

Method: Created a corpus with speech recordings, transcripts, and translations in 12 languages, and tested automatic misunderstanding detection using large language models like Gemini.

Result: Gemini model detected misunderstandings with 77% recall and 47% precision.

Conclusion: The corpus is valuable for cross-lingual research, and automatic misunderstanding detection shows promise with further refinement needed.

Abstract: Speech processing and translation technology have the potential to facilitate meetings of individuals who do not share any common language. To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.
  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings. We annotate misunderstandings manually and also test the ability of current large language models to detect them automatically. The results show that the Gemini model is able to identify text spans with misunderstandings with recall of 77% and precision of 47%.

TL;DR: SlideTailor is a human-inspired framework for personalized slide generation, using implicit user preferences from example pairs and templates, and enhancing alignment with oral narration via chain-of-speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slide generation methods often produce suboptimal results due to under-specified user preferences, failing to meet individual needs.

Method: Proposes SlideTailor, an agentic framework that uses example paper-slide pairs and visual templates to distill implicit user preferences, and introduces chain-of-speech for oral narration alignment.

Result: Effectively generates customized, editable slides aligned with user preferences, improving quality and enabling applications like video presentations.

Conclusion: SlideTailor addresses the gap in personalized slide generation, demonstrating effectiveness through experiments and a new benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Automatic presentation slide generation can greatly streamline content creation. However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing moderation tools that treat safety risks and adversarial threats separately, aiming for robust and generalizable safeguards.

Method: Introduces AprielGuard, trained on diverse open and synthetic data, including standalone prompts, multi-turn conversations, and agentic workflows, augmented with reasoning traces.

Result: Outperforms existing solutions like Llama-Guard and Granite Guardian in detecting harmful content and adversarial manipulations, especially in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: AprielGuard advances transparent research on reliable safeguards for LLMs, demonstrating strong performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against unsafe or adversarial behavior is critical as they are increasingly deployed in conversational and agentic settings. Existing moderation tools often treat safety risks (e.g. toxicity, bias) and adversarial threats (e.g. prompt injections, jailbreaks) as separate problems, limiting their robustness and generalizability. We introduce AprielGuard, an 8B parameter safeguard model that unify these dimensions within a single taxonomy and learning framework. AprielGuard is trained on a diverse mix of open and synthetic data covering standalone prompts, multi-turn conversations, and agentic workflows, augmented with structured reasoning traces to improve interpretability. Across multiple public and proprietary benchmarks, AprielGuard achieves strong performance in detecting harmful content and adversarial manipulations, outperforming existing opensource guardrails such as Llama-Guard and Granite Guardian, particularly in multi-step and reasoning intensive scenarios. By releasing the model, we aim to advance transparent and reproducible research on reliable safeguards for LLMs.

Motivation: To assess the reliability of LLMs in psychiatric self-assessment by comparing their diagnostic accuracy with human professionals for BPD and NPD.

Method: Direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs (like Gemini Pro) and mental health professionals using Polish-language autobiographical accounts.

Result: Gemini Pro surpassed humans in overall accuracy (65.48% vs. 43.57%) but underdiagnosed NPD (F1 = 6.7 vs. 50.0). Models excelled in BPD diagnosis (F1 = 83.4) compared to humans (F1 = 80.0).

Conclusion: LLMs are competent in interpreting clinical data but face reliability and bias issues, particularly with value-laden terms like 'narcissism.'

Abstract: Growing reliance on LLMs for psychiatric self-assessment raises questions about their ability to interpret qualitative patient narratives. We present the first direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals in diagnosing Borderline (BPD) and Narcissistic (NPD) Personality Disorders utilizing Polish-language first-person autobiographical accounts. We show that the top-performing Gemini Pro models surpassed human professionals in overall diagnostic accuracy by 21.91 percentage points (65.48% vs. 43.57%). While both models and human experts excelled at identifying BPD (F1 = 83.4 & F1 = 80.0, respectively), models severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1 = 6.7 vs. 50.0), showing a reluctance toward the value-laden term "narcissism." Qualitatively, models provided confident, elaborate justifications focused on patterns and formal categories, while human experts remained concise and cautious, emphasizing the patient's sense of self and temporal experience. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs are highly competent at interpreting complex first-person clinical data, they remain subject to critical reliability and bias issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates by extracting semantic representations from speech.

Method: SpidR uses masked prediction with self-distillation and online clustering. The student model predicts teacher-derived assignments, stabilizing clustering and improving codebook quality.

Result: SpidR surpasses wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR in language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC) and cuts pretraining time from a week to one day on 16 GPUs.

Conclusion: SpidR advances speech representation learning for textless language modeling, validated by improved benchmarks and reduced training time, with code and model checkpoints made publicly available.

Abstract: The parallel advances in language modeling and speech representation learning have raised the prospect of learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates. This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.

TL;DR: BanglaRiddleEval introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning in Bangla riddles, showing moderate success but significant gaps compared to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' reasoning abilities in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings, specifically Bangla.

Method: Created BanglaRiddleEval with 1,244 riddles across four tasks, used LLM-based pipelines for explanations and annotations, and evaluated diverse models.

Result: Moderate semantic overlap but low correctness in generative QA; MCQ accuracy at 56% vs. human 83%; ambiguity resolution 26%-68%.

Conclusion: LLMs show partial Bangla riddle reasoning but fall short of human performance, making BanglaRiddleEval a challenging benchmark.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning.

TL;DR: Sentiment-aware text summarization improves emotional nuance capture in unstructured user-generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing summarization methods struggle with noisy, informal text, missing critical emotional cues.

Method: Extends TextRank and UniLM by embedding sentiment signals into ranking and generation.

Result: Produces concise, sentiment-enriched summaries.

Conclusion: Enhances decision-making in dynamic online environments.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of unstructured data from social media, reviews, and forums, text mining has become essential in Information Systems (IS) for extracting actionable insights. Summarization can condense fragmented, emotion-rich posts, but existing methods-optimized for structured news-struggle with noisy, informal content. Emotional cues are critical for IS tasks such as brand monitoring and market analysis, yet few studies integrate sentiment modeling into summarization of short user-generated texts. We propose a sentiment-aware framework extending extractive (TextRank) and abstractive (UniLM) approaches by embedding sentiment signals into ranking and generation processes. This dual design improves the capture of emotional nuances and thematic relevance, producing concise, sentiment-enriched summaries that enhance timely interventions and strategic decision-making in dynamic online environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fall short in open-ended research demands, requiring better skills in intent recognition, decision-making, and cross-source verification.

Method: Proposes Step-DeepResearch with Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities, progressive training (mid-training, SFT, RL), and Checklist-style Judger.

Result: Step-DeepResearch scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics and outperforms comparable models on ADR-Bench, rivaling SOTA closed-source models.

Conclusion: Refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level performance cost-effectively.

Abstract: As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency.

### [90] [Distilling to Hybrid Attention Models via KL-Guided Layer Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20569)
*Yanhong Li,Songlin Yang,Shawn Tan,Mayank Mishra,Rameswar Panda,Jiawei Zhou,Yoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a simple, efficient method for selecting layers in hybrid attention Transformers using importance scores from generic text training, outperforming existing heuristics and specialized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve inference efficiency of LLMs by distilling pretrained softmax attention Transformers into hybrid architectures without costly pretraining, focusing on optimal layer selection.

Method: Uses layer importance scores from small-scale generic text training for selection, followed by distillation via attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based matching, and finetuning.

Result: The approach is more effective than uniform heuristics or specialized-dataset methods for layer selection in hybrid architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed layer selection method enhances efficiency in hybrid attention Transformers, offering a scalable alternative to existing techniques.

Abstract: Distilling pretrained softmax attention Transformers into more efficient hybrid architectures that interleave softmax and linear attention layers is a promising approach for improving the inference efficiency of LLMs without requiring expensive pretraining from scratch. A critical factor in the conversion process is layer selection, i.e., deciding on which layers to convert to linear attention variants. This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.

### [91] [Can LLMs Predict Their Own Failures? Self-Awareness via Internal Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20578)
*Amirhosein Ghasemabadi,Di Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gnosis introduces a lightweight self-awareness mechanism for LLMs to predict their own failures by decoding internal states, outperforming external judges with minimal added cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to recognize their mistakes, and existing methods rely on costly external judges or weak self-critiques. Gnosis seeks to enable intrinsic self-verification.

Method: Gnosis passively observes LLM internal states (hidden states, attention patterns), compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with minimal overhead (~5M parameters).

Result: Gnosis outperforms internal baselines and external judges across benchmarks (math reasoning, QA, academic knowledge) and scales (1.7B-20B parameters), with zero-shot generalization and early failure detection.

Conclusion: Correctness cues are intrinsic to LLM generation and can be efficiently extracted without external supervision, as demonstrated by Gnosis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.

### [92] [Cube Bench: A Benchmark for Spatial Visual Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20595)
*Dhruv Anand,Ehsan Shareghi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cube Bench is a Rubik's Cube benchmark for assessing multimodal LLMs' spatial and sequential reasoning skills, revealing performance gaps between models and limited recovery from errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) spatial and sequential reasoning abilities using a structured benchmark inspired by Rubik's Cube.

Method: Cube Bench tests five skills: face reconstruction, optimal move selection, move outcome prediction, multi-step plan execution, and error detection/correction. It uses scrambled cube states, uniform prompts/parsers, and a distance-to-solved metric.

Result: Accuracy declines with scramble depth; models struggle to recover from errors. Closed-source models outperform open-weight ones, but all degrade at higher complexity. Self-correction helps modestly but risks overthinking.

Conclusion: Cube Bench is a reproducible tool highlighting MLLMs' limitations in sequential spatial reasoning, with closed-source models leading but still failing at higher complexity.

Abstract: We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: MoE-DiffuSeq enhances diffusion models for long document generation by combining sparse attention and a mixture of experts, improving efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational cost and memory overhead of existing diffusion-based text generation models like DiffuSeq for long sequences.

Method: Integrates sparse attention with a mixture of experts, introduces a customized sparse attention mechanism, and incorporates a soft absorbing state in the diffusion process.

Result: Significantly improves training efficiency, sampling speed, and retains text quality and coherence.

Conclusion: MoE-DiffuSeq advances diffusion models for practical high-quality long-form text generation.

Abstract: We present MoE-DiffuSeq, a mixture of experts based framework for enhancing diffusion models in long document generation. Existing diffusion based text generation models, such as DiffuSeq, suffer from high computational cost and memory overhead when applied to extended sequences. To address these challenges, MoE-DiffuSeq integrates sparse attention with a mixture of experts architecture, enabling efficient and scalable long sequence modeling. Our approach introduces a customized sparse attention mechanism designed to reduce computational complexity while preserving text quality and coherence. In addition, we incorporate a soft absorbing state within the diffusion process to accelerate sequence reconstruction and improve generation precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoE-DiffuSeq significantly improves training efficiency and sampling speed compared to existing diffusion models. These advantages are particularly effective for long document scenarios, including scientific article generation, code repository modeling, and long form dialogue generation. Benchmark results further show that MoE-DiffuSeq improves efficiency, speed, accuracy, and expressiveness, advancing the practical applicability of diffusion models for high quality long form text generation.

*Yousef Mehrdad Bibalan,Behrouz Far,Mohammad Moshirpour,Bahareh Ghiyasian*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented, multi-agent framework combining RAG and collaborative reasoning improves WiP prediction accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate WiP prediction is essential for optimizing operational planning and handling workload fluctuations.

Method: The framework uses RAG to transform event logs into narratives, embeds them into semantic memory, and employs predictor and decision-making agents for collaborative reasoning.

Result: Achieves MAPE of 1.50%, outperforming TCN, LSTM, and baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating retrieval mechanisms and multi-agent reasoning enhances WiP prediction effectiveness.

Abstract: Work-in-Progress (WiP) prediction is critical for predictive process monitoring, enabling accurate anticipation of workload fluctuations and optimized operational planning. This paper proposes a retrieval-augmented, multi-agent framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and collaborative multi-agent reasoning for WiP prediction. The narrative generation component transforms structured event logs into semantically rich natural language stories, which are embedded into a semantic vector-based process memory to facilitate dynamic retrieval of historical context during inference. The framework includes predictor agents that independently leverage retrieved historical contexts and a decision-making assistant agent that extracts high-level descriptive signals from recent events. A fusion agent then synthesizes predictions using ReAct-style reasoning over agent outputs and retrieved narratives. We evaluate our framework on two real-world benchmark datasets. Results show that the proposed retrieval-augmented multi-agent approach achieves competitive prediction accuracy, obtaining a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.50\% on one dataset, and surpassing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and persistence baselines. The results highlight improved robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating retrieval mechanisms and multi-agent reasoning in WiP prediction.

### [95] [When Natural Strategies Meet Fuzziness and Resource-Bounded Actions (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20457)
*Marco Aruta,Francesco Improta,Vadim Malvone,Aniello Murano*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: HumanATLF logic addresses gaps in MAS reasoning by incorporating fuzzy semantics and resource-bound actions, proving model checking complexity varies with strategic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in current MAS frameworks, such as unrealistic assumptions of zero-cost actions and crisp game structures, contrasting with real-world human decision-making.

Method: Introduces HumanATLF, a logic combining fuzzy semantics and resource-bound actions, with formal syntax and semantics. Analyzes model checking complexity under varying constraints.

Result: Model checking is P for fixed strategy complexity and budget, NP-complete with one strategic operator, and Delta^P_2-complete when these vary. Recall-based strategies are PSPACE-decidable.

Conclusion: HumanATLF bridges the gap between idealized MAS assumptions and real-world human decision-making, validated via implementation in VITAMIN for drone rescue scenarios.

Abstract: In formal strategic reasoning for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), agents are typically assumed to (i) employ arbitrarily complex strategies, (ii) execute each move at zero cost, and (iii) operate over fully crisp game structures. These idealized assumptions stand in stark contrast with human decision making in real world environments. The natural strategies framework along with some of its recent variants, partially addresses this gap by restricting strategies to concise rules guarded by regular expressions. Yet, it still overlook both the cost of each action and the uncertainty that often characterizes human perception of facts over the time. In this work, we introduce HumanATLF, a logic that builds upon natural strategies employing both fuzzy semantics and resource bound actions: each action carries a real valued cost drawn from a non refillable budget, and atomic conditions and goals have degrees in [0,1]. We give a formal syntax and semantics, and prove that model checking is in P when both the strategy complexity k and resource budget b are fixed, NP complete if just one strategic operator over Boolean objectives is allowed, and Delta^P_2 complete when k and b vary. Moreover, we show that recall based strategies can be decided in PSPACE. We implement our algorithms in VITAMIN, an open source model checking tool for MAS and validate them on an adversarial resource aware drone rescue scenario.

TL;DR: PhysMaster is an LLM-based agent designed as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist, integrating abstract reasoning with numerical computation for scientific research acceleration, automation, and discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based systems are limited in open scientific scenarios, especially physics, which require abstract reasoning and computational integration.

Method: PhysMaster combines abstract reasoning with numerical computation using LANDAU (Layered Academic Data Universe) and employs an adaptive exploration strategy.

Result: Evaluated across physics domains, PhysMaster accelerates research, automates hypothesis-driven tasks, and autonomously explores open problems.

Conclusion: PhysMaster demonstrates potential to revolutionize physics research by enhancing efficiency, automation, and discovery capabilities.

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent framework for long-video QA, combining grounding and vision agents to improve temporal grounding and fine-grained detail extraction, outperforming baselines on episode-level datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing methods that compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues in long-video QA.

Method: A master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent for targeted textual observations, trained with reinforcement learning for efficient cooperation.

Result: The proposed system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines on LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ datasets, with reinforcement learning further enhancing reasoning and planning.

Conclusion: The multi-agent framework effectively improves temporal grounding and detail extraction in long-video QA, demonstrating superior performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

*Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,F. Sibel Salman,Walter J. Gutjahr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bi-objective optimization model for post-disaster relief supply distribution, balancing fairness (Gini-index) and efficiency (travel time). It introduces a B&P algorithm that outperforms MIP solvers, reducing inequity by 34% without losing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster relief distribution often struggles with balancing fairness and efficiency due to limited supplies and logistical constraints. This paper aims to address this gap by optimizing both objectives simultaneously.

Method: The authors formulate a bi-objective MIP model using the $ε$-constraint method. Valid inequalities and an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations are derived. A B&P algorithm is developed for efficient problem-solving.

Result: Computational tests on real and predicted datasets show the B&P algorithm outperforms MIP solvers, reducing distribution inequity by 34% while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The bi-objective approach is effective, with lexicographic optimization favoring demand coverage in extreme time constraints and a balanced approach being crucial for moderately restrictive scenarios.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

*Eric Yeh,John Cadigan,Ran Chen,Dick Crouch,Melinda Gervasio,Dayne Freitag*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs simulate human behavior effectively, addressing personality-based decision-making challenges through interpolative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring LLMs as proxies for human behavior in simulations, aiming to reduce experimental overhead and improve replicability.

Method: Uses interpolative decoding to represent personality dimensions with opposed prompts and interpolate behavior.

Result: Interpolative decoding reliably modulates Big Five personality traits and mimics human decision-making in economic games.

Conclusion: LLMs with interpolative decoding can replicate human actions, promising for behavioral research applications.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Motivation: To address the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge by improving fine-grained multi-label species identification using high-resolution images.

Method: Employed class prototypes from training data to guide a segmentation ViT, using K-Means clustering and a frozen DinoV2 for feature extraction and reconstruction.

Result: Achieved fifth place with an F1 score of 0.33331, close to the top-performing submission.

Conclusion: The method shows competitive performance and potential for domain adaptation in multi-label classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intra-class variability and underrepresented classes hinder DL models in FGVC tasks.

Method: Apply clustering per class to discover pseudo-labels for hierarchical classification, learning fine-grained features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PlantNet300k, though some components are not fully optimized.

Conclusion: The method shows promise but requires further development for conclusive evidence of effectiveness.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

*Zhe Sun,Xueyuan Yang,Yujie Lu,Zhenliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces S³IT, a benchmark for evaluating embodied social intelligence by combining social norms and physical constraints in a seat-ordering task, revealing gaps in LLMs' spatial intelligence but strong conflict-resolution skills with textual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations lack integration of social and physical constraints, necessitating a benchmark like S³IT to assess embodied social intelligence realistically.

Method: S³IT employs a procedurally extensible framework for diverse scenarios, requiring dialogue-based preference acquisition, environment perception, and multi-objective optimization in a seat-ordering task.

Result: LLMs struggle with S³IT's spatial intelligence demands but perform close to human levels in resolving conflicts with explicit textual cues.

Conclusion: S³IT highlights LLMs' spatial intelligence deficiencies while showcasing their conflict-resolution strengths, emphasizing the need for improved embodied social intelligence benchmarks.

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

TL;DR: The paper proposes LieFlow, a method for discovering symmetries in data by matching flows on Lie groups, offering flexibility and fewer assumptions than previous works. It demonstrates success in discovering discrete groups in 2D/3D point clouds and addresses challenges like 'last-minute convergence.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetry is crucial for understanding physical systems and improving machine learning performance. Directly learning symmetries from data can enhance efficiency and adaptability.

Method: LieFlow learns symmetries via flow matching on Lie groups, formulating symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a hypothesis group to match observed symmetries.

Result: Experiments show LieFlow successfully discovers discrete groups (e.g., reflections) in 2D/3D point clouds and addresses the 'last-minute convergence' issue with a novel interpolation scheme.

Conclusion: LieFlow is a flexible and effective method for symmetry discovery, requiring fewer assumptions and demonstrating practical success in identifying symmetries.

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

TL;DR: SOF learns latent skills from action-free videos using optical flow for better planning and action translation, improving multitask and long-horizon performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between video generative models (rich visuals but poor action translation) and latent-action models (good action alignment but limited planning) for generalist robots.

Method: Introduces SOF, which learns latent skills from videos via optical flow representation, aligning motion with video dynamics and robot actions.

Result: SOF improves performance in multitask and long-horizon settings by enabling high-level planning and easier skill-to-action translation.

Conclusion: SOF effectively acquires and composes skills from raw visual data, demonstrating promise for generalist robot learning.

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProbGLC, a probabilistic cross-view geolocalization method for rapid disaster response, combining explainability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disasters are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, necessitating accurate and fast geolocalization for effective response.

Method: ProbGLC integrates probabilistic and deterministic models into a unified framework, offering uncertainty quantification and high accuracy.

Result: ProbGLC achieves superior geolocalization accuracy (0.86 Acc@1km, 0.97 Acc@25km) and explainability on diverse disaster datasets.

Conclusion: ProbGLC demonstrates strong potential for improving disaster response through generative cross-view geolocalization.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance content moderation by training large language models (LLMs) for expert-level accuracy, addressing challenges like sparse labels and evolving policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content moderation at scale is challenging due to the volume of data, evolving policies, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond simple pattern matching. RL offers a potential solution to improve accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The study evaluates RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies, including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks, to adapt LLMs for content moderation tasks.

Result: RL shows sigmoid-like scaling, improving performance with more data and optimization before plateauing. It outperforms supervised fine-tuning in complex tasks and is up to 100x more data-efficient.

Conclusion: RL is a promising approach for scalable content moderation, especially where expert annotations are limited, offering significant efficiency gains and improved reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reason2Decide is a two-stage training framework for LLMs that improves predictive accuracy and rationale alignment in clinical decision support, outperforming baselines and reducing reliance on human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing exposure bias and misaligned explanations in LLMs for clinical decision support, the paper aims to enhance predictive accuracy and rationale fidelity.

Method: A two-stage framework: Stage-1 trains on rationale generation, and Stage-2 jointly trains on label prediction and rationale generation using scheduled sampling.

Result: Outperforms fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity metrics, even with smaller models (40x smaller than foundation models).

Conclusion: Reason2Decide effectively improves clinical reasoning accessibility and explainability while reducing dependence on human annotations.

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

*Chaithra,Kamesh Kadimisetty,Biju R Mohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive framework combining LLMs with stock market feedback for better financial sentiment analysis in the Indian stock market, showing improved accuracy and market alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial sentiment analysis lacks consideration of stock prices or market feedback.

Method: Fine-tunes LLaMA 3.2 3B using SentiFin dataset, employs RAG for contextual info, and integrates RL (PPO) for dynamic adaptation.

Result: Improved accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baselines on NIFTY 50 news headlines (2024-2025).

Conclusion: The framework validates the effectiveness of combining LLMs, feedback, and RL for market-aware sentiment analysis.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

*Zhuo Yang,Yeyun chen,Jiaqing Xie,Ben Gao,Shuaike Shen,Wanhao Liu,Liujia Yang,Beilun Wang,Tianfan Fu,Yuqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MolAct is an agentic reinforcement learning framework for molecular editing and optimization, outperforming baselines by combining reasoning, tool-use, and iterative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the multi-step challenges of molecular design by formalizing it as an agentic reinforcement learning problem.

Method: MolAct employs a two-stage training paradigm (editing capability building followed by property optimization) and uses LLM agents to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and edits.

Result: MolEditAgent-7B achieves high validity rates in edits; MolOptAgent-7B excels in optimizing properties like LogP while maintaining balanced performance.

Conclusion: Treating molecular design as a tool-augmented, multi-step process enables reliable and interpretable improvements.

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

### [110] [Enhancing Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting in Off-the-Shelf LLMs via Noise Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20140)
*Xingyou Yin,Ceyao Zhang,Min Hu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores improving zero-shot time series forecasting with frozen large language models (LLMs) by injecting noise into raw data before tokenization, ensuring robustness without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting without fine-tuning, addressing the sensitivity of frozen models to input tokenization by enhancing robustness through noise injection.

Method: The proposed method involves injecting noise into raw time series data before tokenizing it for LLMs, acting as inference-time augmentation to focus on underlying temporal patterns.

Result: Empirical validation shows improved forecasting performance across benchmarks, supported by theoretical analysis and novel datasets to ensure unbiased evaluation.

Conclusion: This approach advances the use of frozen LLMs for time series forecasting by mitigating distribution shift sensitivity through noise injection, validated rigorously with new datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving energy efficiency in data centers by predicting Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) using a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) model, comparing it with GRU. It uses simulated data from Singapore and feature selection methods for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising energy consumption of data centers and the need for sustainability drive the development of energy-efficient solutions. Predicting PUE helps identify key features for energy optimization.

Method: A BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is developed, with feature selection via RFECV and hyperparameter optimization. Performance is compared with GRU using MSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics.

Result: The BiGRU model's performance is evaluated against GRU, with metrics indicating its effectiveness in PUE prediction.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of BiGRU models for enhancing data center energy efficiency, contributing to sustainability goals.

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare human and LLM generalization abilities in concept inference tasks, specifically focusing on inductive biases and inference strategies.

Method: Used a Bayesian model as an analytical framework to examine the performance of humans and LLMs in the number game.

Result: Humans outperformed LLMs by flexibly inferring rule-based and similarity-based concepts and demonstrated few-shot generalization, while LLMs relied more on mathematical rules and needed more samples.

Conclusion: The study highlights fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs generalize and infer mathematical concepts.

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PreSa, a framework for offline PbRL that directly learns safe policies from preferences and safety labels, avoiding issues with reward/cost model errors in constrained RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for safe RLHF struggle with long-horizon tasks due to error accumulation in reward and cost models. A direct approach is needed.

Method: PreSa combines preference learning and safety alignment in a Lagrangian optimization, bypassing explicit reward/cost model learning.

Result: Empirical results show PreSa outperforms baselines, achieving high rewards while ensuring safety.

Conclusion: Direct policy learning from preferences and safety labels is more effective than indirect methods in offline PbRL.

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Result: The platform supports broad research needs, including perception, cognition, decision-making, and human-AI collaboration, with scalable benchmarks.

Conclusion: TongSIM accelerates progress toward general embodied intelligence by offering a unified, flexible, and scalable training and evaluation platform.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemR$^3$ introduces a closed-loop control system for memory retrieval in LLM agents, improving answer quality and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems focus on compression and storage but lack explicit control over retrieval, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: MemR$^3$ uses a router for action selection (retrieve, reflect, answer) and a global evidence-gap tracker for transparency.

Result: The system outperforms baselines on the LoCoMo benchmark, improving RAG by 7.29% and Zep by 1.94%.

Conclusion: MemR$^3$ offers a plug-and-play solution for enhancing memory retrieval in LLM agents.

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from high inference latency (3-5 Hz), hindering their deployment in dynamic environments where smooth robotic interaction requires 20-30 Hz control frequencies.

Method: Introduces Cross-Request Pipelining, a scheduler that batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases. Also proposes Cross-Request State Packed Forward operator and Unified KV Ring Buffer to optimize memory operations.

Result: ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x FPS improvement on OpenVLA-7B, enabling real-time dynamic manipulation on edge hardware.

Conclusion: ActionFlow successfully bridges the latency gap in VLA models for robotics, enhancing real-time performance without compromising accuracy or requiring retraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Motivation: To transform LLMs from passive tool-users to active workflow architects by autonomously synthesizing procedural memory.

Method: Conducts a case study on Outlook-OneDrive orchestration, addressing gaps like Discovery, Verification, Decomposition, and Scaling.

Result: Demonstrates LLMs can autonomously write production-grade code by following a hypothesize-probe-code methodology.

Conclusion: Autonomous skill synthesis is achievable by addressing structural bottlenecks, enabling robust code generation.

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

Result: Outperformed existing models in accuracy, reduced interpretation time by 18.3%, and improved report quality scores. Preferred by experts in 54.3% of cases.

Conclusion: Janus-Pro-CXR enhances diagnostic reliability and efficiency, especially in resource-limited settings, and its open-sourcing aims to advance AI-assisted radiology.

Abstract: A global shortage of radiologists has been exacerbated by the significant volume of chest X-ray workloads, particularly in primary care. Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the shift toward AI-driven 'agentic science at scale' for multi-step scientific workflows, introduces Bohrium+SciMaster as an infrastructure-and-ecosystem solution, and demonstrates its effectiveness in reducing scientific cycle times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing challenges of scaling agentic science, such as reproducibility, traceability, and tool readiness, while leveraging AI's potential to accelerate scientific output.

Method: The proposed method involves Bohrium, a managed hub for AI4S assets, and SciMaster, which orchestrates these assets into workflows. A 'scientific intelligence substrate' enables reusable components for reasoning and action.

Result: Eleven master agents were tested in real workflows, achieving significant reductions in cycle time and generating large-scale execution-grounded signals.

Conclusion: The Bohrium+SciMaster stack effectively supports scalable agentic science by combining infrastructure, orchestration, and reusable components, enabling faster and more traceable scientific workflows.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study compares LLMs and SLMs for predicting shock in ICU patients, finding no inherent superiority of LLMs despite GatorTron-Base's high recall. Future LLM training should focus on clinical trajectory prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting shock early can improve patient outcomes, and the application of LLMs in predictive tasks is under-researched.

Method: Compared GatorTron-Base, Llama 8B, Mistral 7B against BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec using MIMIC III data with focal and cross-entropy losses.

Result: GatorTron-Base achieved 80.5% weighted recall, but overall performance was comparable between SLMs and LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs are not inherently better than SLMs for clinical predictions; future work should prioritize clinical trajectory prediction.

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces T-MED, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for teacher sentiment analysis, and proposes AAM-TSA, an asymmetric attention-based model that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teachers' emotional states significantly affect education, but current studies often miss accurate emotional capture due to performative behavior and neglect of instructional context.

Method: The study constructs the T-MED dataset via human-machine collaborative labeling and develops AAM-TSA, featuring asymmetric attention and hierarchical gating for multimodal fusion.

Result: AAM-TSA achieves superior accuracy and interpretability on T-MED compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The dataset and model advance teacher sentiment analysis by addressing multimodal and instructional context gaps.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, an LLM-based agent for automated stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) planning, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. The reasoning model achieved comparable dosimetry to human planners while reducing cochlear dose and demonstrated systematic planning behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the opacity concerns of black-box AI systems in SRS planning by developing a transparent, reasoning-based agent.

Method: SAGE, an LLM-based agent, was tested in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases. Two variants (reasoning and non-reasoning) generated plans, which were evaluated against human benchmarks.

Result: The reasoning model matched human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, max dose, conformity, gradient) and outperformed them in reducing cochlear dose. It also exhibited systematic planning behaviors like constraint verification and trade-off deliberation.

Conclusion: The reasoning model offers transparent and auditable SRS planning, showing potential to improve clinical adoption of AI in radiation therapy.

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

*Bibek Poudel,Weizi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An RL framework using graph attention networks improves transit network design, outperforming manual and heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual transit network planning is inefficient due to large solution spaces; RL can automate and optimize this process.

Method: Uses an end-to-end RL framework with graph attention networks and a two-level reward structure for sequential network construction.

Result: Achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to real-world networks.

Conclusion: End-to-end RL significantly outperforms human-designed systems and heuristics in realistic city-scale transit network design.

Abstract: Designing efficient transit route networks is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally relies on manual planning processes. We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and heterogeneity of EDA workloads challenge traditional machine learning, creating a need for advanced prediction methods in cloud computing.

Result: The framework outperforms traditional methods on real-world cloud datasets, setting a new performance prediction benchmark in EDA.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs effectively addresses EDA workload prediction challenges, offering superior accuracy and reliability for cloud computing applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of cloud computing in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry has created a critical need for resource and job lifetime prediction to achieve optimal scheduling. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle with the complexity and heterogeneity of EDA workloads, requiring extensive feature engineering and domain expertise. We propose a novel framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this challenge through text-to-text regression. We introduce the scientific notation and prefix filling to constrain the LLM, significantly improving output format reliability. Moreover, we found that full-attention finetuning and inference improves the prediction accuracy of sliding-window-attention LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on real-world cloud datasets, setting a new baseline for performance prediction in the EDA domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores machine learning paradigms for human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors, focusing on methods that balance performance and labeling needs. It introduces weakly self-supervised learning, which achieves competitive accuracy with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements in HAR, the study investigates various learning paradigms to find efficient solutions for real-world applications where labeled data are scarce.

Method: The paper compares six approaches: (1) fully supervised learning, (2) unsupervised learning, (3) weakly supervised learning with constraints, (4) multi-task learning with knowledge sharing, (5) self-supervised learning using domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework combining domain knowledge and minimal labels.

Result: Experiments show weakly supervised methods match fully supervised performance with fewer labels. Multi-task learning improves accuracy, and the weakly self-supervised framework achieves efficiency with only 10% labeled data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the strengths of different paradigms and proposes the weakly self-supervised framework as a practical solution for HAR with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors has advanced through various machine learning paradigms, each with inherent trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements. While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.

TL;DR: A multimodal deep learning model was developed to predict in-hospital mortality risk in ICU patients using structured and unstructured data, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating the value of external validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality helps clinicians optimize treatment for critically ill patients.

Method: Developed a multimodal model using structured (time-invariant/time-variant variables) and unstructured (clinical notes, chest X-rays) data from multiple ICU datasets (MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, HiRID).

Result: The model achieved AUROC scores up to 0.92, with improvements when including clinical notes and imaging (AUROC 0.89). External validation showed consistent performance (AUROC 0.84-0.92).

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse patient data sources enhances mortality prediction accuracy, and external validation ensures reliability across institutions.

Abstract: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can aid clinicians in optimizing treatment. The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of finding rare but useful solutions in vast candidate spaces across tasks like language generation and reinforcement learning.

Method: ICFA treats search as target-conditioned reweighting, reusing proposal samplers and similarity functions to focus sampling adaptively.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation, with theoretical and practical insights.

Conclusion: ICFA offers a practical and stable approach to focused search, extendable to hybrid architectures combining prompting and algorithmic reweighting.

Abstract: Finding rare but useful solutions in very large candidate spaces is a recurring practical challenge across language generation, planning, and reinforcement learning. We present a practical framework, \emph{Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm} (ICFA), that treats search as a target-conditioned reweighting process. ICFA reuses an available proposal sampler and a task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution, while adaptively controlling focusing strength to avoid degeneracy. We provide a clear recipe, a stability diagnostic based on effective sample size, a compact theoretical sketch explaining when ICFA can reduce sample needs, and two reproducible experiments: constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. We further show how structured prompts instantiate an approximate, language-level form of ICFA and describe a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB), a Python library for evaluating synthetic tabular data fidelity, emphasizing modularity, automation, and visualization across diverse real-world use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented and inconsistent evaluation of synthetic data necessitates a unified, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking tool.

Method: SDB employs automated feature-type detection, fidelity metrics (distributional, dependency-level, structure preservation), and visualization schemas.

Result: SDB successfully assessed synthetic data fidelity across healthcare, socioeconomic/financial modeling, and cybersecurity use cases, addressing diverse data types and complexities.

Conclusion: SDB provides a robust, domain-agnostic solution for synthetic data evaluation, enhancing transparency and reproducibility in AI applications.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), synthetic data are widely used to accelerate innovation while preserving privacy and enabling broader data accessibility. However, the evaluation of synthetic data remains fragmented across heterogeneous metrics, ad-hoc scripts, and incomplete reporting practices. To address this gap, we introduce Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB), a modular Pythonic based library to quantitatively and visually assess the fidelity of synthetic tabular data. SDB supports: (i) automated feature-type detection, (ii) distributional and dependency-level fidelity metrics, (iii) graph- and embedding-based structure preservation scores, and (iv) a rich suite of data visualization schemas. To demonstrate the breadth, robustness, and domain-agnostic applicability of the SDB, we evaluated the framework across three real-world use cases that differ substantially in scale, feature composition, statistical complexity, and downstream analytical requirements. These include: (i) healthcare diagnostics, (ii) socioeconomic and financial modelling, and (iii) cybersecurity and network traffic analysis. These use cases reveal how SDB can address diverse data fidelity assessment challenges, varying from mixed-type clinical variables to high-cardinality categorical attributes and high-dimensional telemetry signals, while at the same time offering a consistent, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking across heterogeneous domains.

TL;DR: A novel deep learning architecture, MDFA-Net, is proposed for efficient RUL prediction in battery degradation, outperforming existing methods by integrating local and global patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modeling techniques for assessing battery degradation sequences are inefficient and insufficient for real-life applications, necessitating a better solution.

Method: MDFA-Net combines dual-path networks: MF-Net preserves shallow information, while EC-Net captures deep trends, integrating both local and global patterns effectively.

Result: Tests on Lithium-ion battery datasets show MDFA-Net outperforms top-tier methods in RUL forecasting and accurately maps capacity degradation.

Conclusion: The proposed MDFA-Net provides a superior solution for RUL prediction by effectively combining shallow and deep features to address inefficiencies in current techniques.

Abstract: Targeted maintenance strategies, ensuring the dependability and safety of industrial machinery. However, current modeling techniques for assessing both local and global correlation of battery degradation sequences are inefficient and difficult to meet the needs in real-life applications. For this reason, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, multiscale dual-path feature aggregation network (MDFA-Net), for RUL prediction. MDFA-Net consists of dual-path networks, the first path network, multiscale feature network (MF-Net) that maintains the shallow information and avoids missing information, and the second path network is an encoder network (EC-Net) that captures the continuous trend of the sequences and retains deep details. Integrating both deep and shallow attributes effectively grasps both local and global patterns. Testing conducted with two publicly available Lithium-ion battery datasets reveals our approach surpasses existing top-tier methods in RUL forecasting, accurately mapping the capacity degradation trajectory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a 1-bit delta compression scheme for fine-tuned LLM variants, reducing checkpoint size and cold-start latency while maintaining accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitations of large fine-tuned LLM checkpoints and cold-start latency by exploiting structured residuals between base and fine-tuned models.

Method: Uses a 1-bit delta scheme storing weight difference signs and per-axis FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. Simplifies loading with packed deltas.

Result: Achieves smaller checkpoint sizes, reduced cold-start latency, and improved reconstruction quality compared to scalar alternatives.

Conclusion: The method is efficient, drop-in compatible, requires minimal calibration, and maintains inference performance without dense reconstruction.

Abstract: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is often limited by the large size of fine-tuned checkpoints and the resulting cold-start latency. Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework for measuring similarity in real- and complex-valued signals, retaining metric and kernel properties while supporting interpretable analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend overlap-based distances to arbitrary signals (real/complex) while preserving bounded metric and kernel structures, enabling interpretable and versatile analytical tools.

Method: Signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, with embeddings into nonnegative multistate representations. The framework uses Tanimoto construction for distances and Möbius inversion for coalition analysis.

Result: The framework provides bounded metrics, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting, usable in applications like correlograms and similarity graphs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework unifies interpretable distance measures, kernel methods, and probabilistic analysis for diverse signal types, enhancing scientific and financial applications.

Abstract: We introduce a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances from nonnegative vectors and measures to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel structure. Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve forecast accuracy by dynamically incorporating cost asymmetry and adapting to varying conditions.

Method: Adjusts forecasts by integrating cost asymmetry into error probability distribution, favoring cheaper scenarios, with a self-regulation mechanism.

Result: Achieves $5.1M annual savings empirically.

Conclusion: The model effectively adapts and delivers substantial cost savings.

Abstract: This work introduces a methodology to adjust forecasts based on node-specific cost function asymmetry. The proposed model generates savings by dynamically incorporating the cost asymmetry into the forecasting error probability distribution to favor the least expensive scenario. Savings are calculated and a self-regulation mechanism modulates the adjustments magnitude based on the observed savings, enabling the model to adapt to station-specific conditions and unmodeled factors such as calibration errors or shifting macroeconomic dynamics. Finally, empirical results demonstrate the model's ability to achieve \$5.1M annual savings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that efficiently integrates data quality assessment with machine learning (ML) model operations in real-time production environments. While existing approaches treat data quality assessment and ML systems as isolated processes, our framework addresses the critical gap between theoretical methods and practical implementation by combining dynamic drift detection, adaptive data quality metrics, and MLOps into a cohesive, lightweight system. The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead. We validate the framework in a steel manufacturing company's Electroslag Remelting (ESR) vacuum pumping process, demonstrating a 12% improvement in model performance (R2 = 94%) and a fourfold reduction in prediction latency. By exploring the impact of data quality acceptability thresholds, we provide actionable insights into balancing data quality standards and predictive performance in industrial applications. This framework represents a significant advancement in MLOps, offering a robust solution for time-sensitive, data-driven decision-making in dynamic industrial environments.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of deploying machine learning models in dynamic real-world scenarios and highlights the need for Continual Learning (CL) and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to ensure reliability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models often fail in real-world applications due to their reliance on fixed training settings and the unrealistic assumption of i.i.d. data. The paper emphasizes the necessity for models that can adapt to evolving data and identify novel inputs.

Method: The paper proposes leveraging Continual Learning (CL) to enable incremental learning from evolving data streams and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to recognize and handle anomalous inputs.

Result: The paper suggests that integrating CL and OOD detection can lead to more robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems capable of handling real-world dynamics.

Conclusion: Addressing the challenges of CL and OOD detection is essential for developing reliable and adaptable machine learning models that perform well in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.

*Carlos Purves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A split-policy architecture reduces computational and communication costs for deploying visual RL policies on edge devices, maintaining comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying RL policies on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to high computational costs and latency.

Method: Introduces a split-policy architecture with an on-device encoder (OpenGL fragment-shader) to compress observations for remote policy inference.

Result: Reduces data transmission, lowers decision latency, and cuts server-side compute while maintaining competitive learning performance.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances trade-offs in performance and resource usage, suitable for edge deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved strong results, but deploying visual policies on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to computational cost and communication latency. Many deployments therefore offload policy inference to a remote server, incurring network round trips and requiring transmission of high-dimensional observations. We introduce a split-policy architecture in which a small on-device encoder, implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes for broad embedded GPU support, transforms each observation into a compact feature tensor that is transmitted to a remote policy head. In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency. The proposed approach reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request, whilst achieving broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over the final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks, with modest trade-offs in mean return. We evaluate across an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a Raspberry Pi 4B, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, reporting learning results, on-device execution behaviour under sustained load, and end-to-end decision latency and scalability measurements under bandwidth shaping. Code for training, deployment, and measurement is released as open source.

*Peng-Hung Tsai,Daniel Berleant*

TL;DR: The paper reviews technology forecasting methods, introduces a hybrid LSTM-Moore's law model for spacecraft lifetime prediction, and advances the STETI approach to address right censoring bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve spacecraft lifetime forecasting by addressing biases in traditional methods and leveraging machine learning advancements.

Method: A hybrid model combining LSTM neural networks and Moore's law is developed, alongside enhancing the STETI approach to mitigate right censoring bias.

Result: The model provides accurate spacecraft lifetime predictions, offering valuable insights for space mission planning and policy.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach and STETI advancements effectively address forecasting challenges, enhancing reliability for space exploration applications.

Abstract: Forecasting technological advancement in complex domains such as space exploration presents significant challenges due to the intricate interaction of technical, economic, and policy-related factors. The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.
  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.
  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making.

*Haocheng Lu,Minjun Zhu,Henry Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight post-training pipeline using a MathVerifier to identify structured errors in LLM-generated solutions, integrating these signals into a weighted DPO objective for targeted improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with mathematical reasoning, and existing binary evaluation methods overlook nuanced errors. RLHF variants are costly and unstable.

Method: Introduces a compact MathVerifier to decompose solutions into error profiles, then uses these signals for hard-negative mining and weighted DPO.

Result: Verifier-guided weighted DPO outperforms vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, especially on near-correct but flawed solutions.

Conclusion: The pipeline offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative to RLHF, improving logical consistency without large overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with mathematical reasoning, and common post-training pipelines often reduce each generated solution to a binary outcome: correct or incorrect. This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for SSL face trade-offs between generative and discriminative performance and high computational costs, limiting practical applications.

Method: FlowFM jointly trains a representation encoder and conditional flow matching generator, simplifying velocity field learning to accelerate and stabilize training.

Result: FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4%, surpasses SSL-Wearables on downstream tasks, and achieves up to 51.0x inference speedup while maintaining high generative quality.

Conclusion: FlowFM offers an efficient and effective solution for SSL by balancing generative and discriminative performance with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn rich representations during data generation, showing potential for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), but they face a trade-off between generative quality and discriminative performance. Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning. Experiments on wearable sensor data show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4\% compared to a diffusion-based approach. On downstream tasks, FlowFM surpassed the state-of-the-art SSL method (SSL-Wearables) on all five datasets while achieving up to a 51.0x inference speedup and maintaining high generative quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ArcGen is a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method that improves generalization across unseen architectures by introducing alignment layers and losses for feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based backdoor detection methods fail to generalize well to new architectures, highlighting the need for architecture-invariant features.

Method: ArcGen introduces an alignment layer in feature extraction and two alignment losses to ensure features are consistent across architectures with similar backdoor behaviors.

Result: The method achieves up to 42.5% improvement in detection performance (AUC) on unseen architectures, validated on 16,896 models.

Conclusion: ArcGen effectively addresses generalization limitations in backdoor detection by focusing on architecture-invariant features.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

TL;DR: Double-Win NAS is a novel neural architecture search paradigm that transforms deep networks into shallow counterparts for improved hardware efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, validated on embedded systems and large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between deep networks' accuracy and shallow networks' hardware efficiency motivates the development of Double-Win NAS for resource-constrained embedded systems.

Method: Double-Win NAS explores deep networks for accuracy, transforms them into shallow equivalents for efficiency, and enhances training with hybrid transformable and arbitrary-resolution elastic techniques.

Result: Experiments on NVIDIA Jetson devices and ImageNet datasets show Double-Win NAS outperforms existing NAS approaches in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Double-Win NAS successfully balances accuracy and hardware efficiency, making it ideal for intelligent embedded systems.

Abstract: Thanks to the evolving network depth, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various embedded scenarios, paving the way for ubiquitous embedded intelligence. Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency. In contrast to deep networks, shallow networks can deliver superior hardware efficiency but often suffer from inferior accuracy. To address this dilemma, we propose Double-Win NAS, a novel deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm tailored for resource-constrained intelligent embedded systems. Specifically, Double-Win NAS strives to automatically explore deep networks to first win strong accuracy, which are then equivalently transformed into their shallow counterparts to further win strong hardware efficiency. In addition to search, we also propose two enhanced training techniques, including hybrid transformable training towards better training accuracy and arbitrary-resolution elastic training towards enabling natural network elasticity across arbitrary input resolutions. Extensive experimental results on two popular intelligent embedded systems (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and two representative large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet and ImageNet-100) clearly demonstrate the superiority of Double-Win NAS over previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.

TL;DR: A systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset removes leakage descriptors, yielding a curated subset of 2280 materials. A three-phase modeling framework shows tree-based models achieve high accuracy (~0.88-0.90 R2), with dielectric tensor components as key contributors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential data leakage in bandgap prediction by removing descriptors encoding band-structure info (e.g., effective masses) and establish a leakage-controlled dataset for reliable modeling.

Method: A three-phase modeling framework incorporating basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes, using tree-based models for prediction.

Result: Tree-based models achieved R2 values of 0.88-0.90, demonstrating minimal accuracy improvement with expanded descriptors. SHAP analysis highlighted dielectric tensor components as dominant predictors.

Conclusion: The study provides a leakage-controlled dataset and baseline metrics for bandgap prediction, emphasizing the importance of avoiding inadvertent descriptor leakage.

Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses. This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies the dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors. This work provides a curated dataset and baseline performance metrics for future leakage-aware bandgap prediction studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a simpler and more effective unsupervised alternative to sparse autoencoders for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks.

Method: Clusters differences in activations, justified via discriminant analysis, and enhances diversity by weighting clustering with activation skewness.

Result: Evaluated across five models and three modalities (vision, language, audio), the method achieves superior concept quality, diversity, and consistency, and enables model steering.

Conclusion: The proposed method surpasses unsupervised SAE variants in concept quality, approaches supervised baselines, and demonstrates causal influence on model behavior.

Abstract: We propose an alternative to sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a simple and effective unsupervised method for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks. The core idea is to cluster differences in activations, which we formally justify within a discriminant analysis framework. To enhance the diversity of extracted concepts, we refine the approach by weighting the clustering using the skewness of activations. The method aligns with Deleuze's modern view of concepts as differences. We evaluate the approach across five models and three modalities (vision, language, and audio), measuring concept quality, diversity, and consistency. Our results show that the proposed method achieves concept quality surpassing prior unsupervised SAE variants while approaching supervised baselines, and that the extracted concepts enable steering of a model's inner representations, demonstrating their causal influence on downstream behavior.

*Gangxiong Zhang,Yongchao Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CAP, a training-free prompting framework, to mitigate demographic biases in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction, improving both fairness and accuracy without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based ICU mortality predictions exhibit demographic biases, and current debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, highlighting the need for a solution that balances fairness and accuracy.

Method: The authors introduce CAP, a prompting framework combining conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning, enabling the model to learn from historical misprediction cases to correct biases.

Result: CAP improves AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, reduces sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%, and achieves highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups.

Conclusion: CAP effectively co-optimizes fairness and performance in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction, offering a transferable solution for equitable clinical decision support.

Abstract: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoPHo introduces a classifier-guided method for generating synthetic graphs with desired structural properties using persistent homology, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of topology data necessitates synthetic graph generation, but current diffusion-based methods either require retraining or lack scalability.

Method: CoPHo incorporates gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier into discrete reverse diffusion and uses persistent homology to guide generation.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show CoPHo outperforms existing methods in matching target metrics and demonstrates transferability on QM9.

Conclusion: CoPHo effectively generates graphs with specified properties, addressing scalability and practical constraints of prior methods.

Abstract: The structure of topology underpins much of the research on performance and robustness, yet available topology data are typically scarce, necessitating the generation of synthetic graphs with desired properties for testing or release. Prior diffusion-based approaches either embed conditions into the diffusion model, requiring retraining for each attribute and hindering real-time applicability, or use classifier-based guidance post-training, which does not account for topology scale and practical constraints. In this paper, we show from a discrete perspective that gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier can be incorporated into the discrete reverse diffusion posterior to steer generation toward specified structural properties. Based on this insight, we propose Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology (CoPHo), which builds a persistent homology filtration over intermediate graphs and interprets features as guidance signals that steer generation toward the desired properties at each denoising step. Experiments on four generic/network datasets demonstrate that CoPHo outperforms existing methods at matching target metrics, and we further validate its transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.

Motivation: Enhancing railway transportation reliability and efficiency through better delay prediction.

Method: Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning (DCIL) mitigates covariate shift without external feedback, blending event-driven and data-driven modeling.

Result: DCIL outperforms regression models and behavioral cloning in predicting delays up to 30 minutes ahead.

Conclusion: DCIL effectively captures delay propagation uncertainty in large-scale networks.

Abstract: Reliable prediction of train delays is essential for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of railway transportation systems. In this work, we reframe delay forecasting as a stochastic simulation task, modeling state-transition dynamics through imitation learning. We introduce Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning (DCIL), a novel self-supervised algorithm that extends DAgger by incorporating distance-based drift correction, thereby mitigating covariate shift during rollouts without requiring access to an external oracle or adversarial schemes. Our approach synthesizes the dynamical fidelity of event-driven models with the representational capacity of data-driven methods, enabling uncertainty-aware forecasting via Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate DCIL using a comprehensive real-world dataset from \textsc{Infrabel}, the Belgian railway infrastructure manager, which encompasses over three million train movements. Our results, focused on predictions up to 30 minutes ahead, demonstrate superior predictive performance of DCIL over traditional regression models and behavioral cloning on deep learning architectures, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the sequential and uncertain nature of delay propagation in large-scale networks.

TL;DR: OpComm combines supervised and reinforcement learning for package volume forecasting in logistics, reducing errors and improving decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting is crucial for efficient logistics, as errors lead to resource misallocation and delays.

Method: OpComm uses LightGBM for demand forecasting, PPO for buffer control, and generative AI for interpretability.

Result: OpComm reduced forecasting error by 21.65% and improved transparency across 400+ stations.

Conclusion: OpComm demonstrates how integrating predictive modeling and reinforcement learning can enhance logistics forecasting and decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of package volumes at delivery stations is critical for last-mile logistics, where errors lead to inefficient resource allocation, higher costs, and delivery delays. We propose OpComm, a forecasting and decision-support framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning-based buffer control and a generative AI-driven communication module. A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering, reflecting real-world trade-offs between unmet demand risks and resource inefficiency. Station outcomes are fed back through a Monte Carlo update mechanism, enabling continual policy adaptation. To enhance interpretability, a generative AI layer produces executive-level summaries and scenario analyses grounded in SHAP-based feature attributions. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers. This work shows how contextual reinforcement learning, coupled with predictive modeling, can address operational forecasting challenges and bridge statistical rigor with practical decision-making in high-stakes logistics environments.

*Soumen Garai,Suman Samui*

TL;DR: OASI, a novel initialization strategy using MOSA, outperforms traditional methods like LHS and Random search in TinyML KWS by balancing accuracy and model size more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the initialization-dependency of MOBO in TinyML KWS devices to achieve better accuracy-resource trade-offs.

Method: Proposed OASI uses MOSA to generate a diverse, high-performing seed Pareto set explicitly balancing accuracy and model size.

Result: OASI achieves the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and lowest generational distance (0.0) with modest computation time increase (1934 s vs. ~1500 s).

Conclusion: OASI outperforms traditional initialization methods in TinyML KWS, confirmed by statistical analysis.

Abstract: Voice assistants utilize Keyword Spotting (KWS) to enable efficient, privacy-friendly activation. However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical solution for efficient transformer inference on edge platforms and suggests future integration of dynamic sparsity and MoE architectures.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale transformer models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and latency. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CUDA-APML is a sparse GPU implementation of APML for 3D point cloud modeling, reducing memory usage by 99.9% while maintaining accuracy by thresholding negligible assignments and using adaptive softmax.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing loss functions for 3D point clouds trade geometric fidelity for computational efficiency. Chamfer Distance and Earth Mover Distance have limitations, and APML's dense formulation scales poorly in memory.

Method: CUDA-APML thresholds negligible assignments, uses adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization in COO form for sparse GPU implementation.

Result: On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML accuracy within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%.

Conclusion: CUDA-APML offers a memory-efficient solution for accurate 3D point cloud modeling without significant loss in performance.

Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes reasoning in LLMs using EM, compares sampling schemes, and finds PPS most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning in LLMs by connecting EM optimization with reward-based methods and evaluating sampling strategies.

Method: Proposes EM-based reasoning, compares rejection sampling, STaR, and PPS on ARC, MMLU, OpenBookQA with Llama/Qwen.

Result: PPS outperforms other sampling schemes in accuracy for learned reasoning models.

Conclusion: Simpler sampling schemes like PPS can significantly enhance reasoning accuracy in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning problems by first generating a rationale and then answering. We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes.

Result: Inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two.

Conclusion: Raises awareness for users and developers about reproducibility issues in clustering algorithms, urging further investigation.

Abstract: Reproducibility is essential in machine learning because it ensures that a model or experiment yields the same scientific conclusion. For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method. Our results reveal inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two. This work aims to raise awareness of this issue among both users and developers, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes.

### [154] [Reduced Order Modeling for Tsunami Forecasting with Bayesian Hierarchical Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19804)
*Shane X. Coffing,John Tipton,Arvind T. Mohan,Darren Engwirda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel reduced order model (ROM) called randPROM, which generalizes to similar problems by learning distributions on initial weights via neural Galerkin-Projections and hierarchical pooling. Applied to tsunami modeling, it reduces simulation effort while maintaining statistical and physical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ROMs are constrained to fixed weights for a specific process, limiting their generalizability. This work aims to develop a ROM that can adapt to similar problems by learning distributions on initial weights.

Method: Neural Galerkin-Projections encode PDE physics via neural networks, while hierarchical pooling learns distributions on initial weights. The randPROM combines these to form a physics surrogate.

Result: randPROMs reduce the number of simulations needed for statistically calibrated tsunami predictions while maintaining physical consistency.

Conclusion: The randPROM approach enables efficient, generalizable, and physically justified modeling of complex spatiotemporal processes like tsunamis.

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maximize revenue and retention while adhering to business constraints like budget.

Method: Estimates CATE with uplift learners and solves constrained allocation problems for targeting decisions.

Result: Outperforms baselines in offline evaluations and shows strategic lift in online A/B tests.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable playbook for causal targeting in marketing campaigns.

Abstract: This paper introduces a marketing decision framework that converts heterogeneous-treatment uplift into constrained targeting strategies to maximize revenue and retention while honoring business guardrails. The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints. The result is a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with strategic KPIs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified approach combines fine-tuning and in-context learning, leveraging the strengths of both methods to outperform traditional baselines in LLM adaptation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between prompt engineering and fine-tuning for LLM adaptation, maximizing performance across varying data availability scenarios.

Method: Fine-tuning LLMs on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, using prequential evaluation for hyperparameter selection in low-data regimes.

Result: The unified approach consistently matches or exceeds the performance of fine-tuning and in-context learning baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating in-context learning into fine-tuning offers a robust, sample-efficient method for adapting LLMs to downstream tasks.

Abstract: When adapting large language models (LLMs) to a specific downstream task, two primary approaches are commonly employed: (1) prompt engineering, often with in-context few-shot learning, leveraging the model's inherent generalization abilities, and (2) fine-tuning on task-specific data, directly optimizing the model's parameters. While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.

*Indranil Halder,Cengiz Pehlevan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores inference-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) using Bayesian linear regression, revealing conditions under which increasing inference samples improves generalization error and identifying optimal sampling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap in understanding the principles behind inference-time scaling in LLMs, particularly focusing on how reward-weighting and sampling affect generalization error.

Method: The authors introduce an analytically tractable model of Bayesian linear regression with reward-weighted sampling, analyzing generalization error in high-dimensional regimes and validating findings experimentally with LLMs.

Result: Generalization error decreases with more inference samples if the reward aligns with the teacher model, but misspecified rewards can lead to an optimal sample limit. An optimal sampling temperature exists for fixed samples.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and empirical insights into when and how inference-time compute scaling is beneficial, highlighting its limitations with increasing task difficulty.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time. However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the "best-of-$k$" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CGM-FAS, a deep-learning approach using Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model non-ergodic path effects in seismic ground-motion, outperforming GP-based methods in efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational limitations of Gaussian Process (GP) methods in large-scale non-ergodic ground-motion modeling and improve accuracy and efficiency in seismic hazard analysis.

Method: Proposes CGM-FAS, leveraging Conditional Variational Autoencoder to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlations directly from data using geographical coordinates.

Result: CGM-FAS matches GP-based predictions for non-ergodic path effects, learns spatial patterns without prescribed correlations, and enables rapid predictions (10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies in 10 seconds).

Conclusion: CGM-FAS offers a scalable, efficient alternative to GP-based methods for non-ergodic ground-motion prediction, with consistent results and faster computation.

Abstract: Recent developments in non-ergodic ground-motion models (GMMs) explicitly model systematic spatial variations in source, site, and path effects, reducing standard deviation to 30-40% of ergodic models and enabling more accurate site-specific seismic hazard analysis. Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains.

*Jiayun Wu,Jiashuo Liu,Zhiyuan Zeng,Tianyang Zhan,Wenhao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses LLM hallucinations by proposing behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning to incentivize models to admit uncertainty, improving calibration and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder their deployment in critical domains, as they stem from training objectives prioritizing data mimicry over factual honesty. Standard reinforcement learning paradigms exacerbate this by rewarding plausible guesses.

Method: The authors introduce behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning, optimizing proper scoring rules for models to output calibrated probabilities and abstain when unsure, either fully or for individual claims.

Result: Smaller behavior-calibrated models outperform larger frontier models in uncertainty quantification, achieving higher accuracy-to-hallucination ratios and competitive calibration errors despite lower factual accuracy.

Conclusion: Behavioral calibration enhances uncertainty quantification in LLMs, decoupling it from raw predictive accuracy, and shows promise for improving model reliability in critical applications.

Abstract: LLM deployment in critical domains is currently impeded by persistent hallucinations--generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Common Task Framework (CTF) for evaluating machine learning methods in seismology to address challenges in forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization of seismic wavefields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seismology struggles with forecasting and reconstruction due to massive computational scales and inadequate real-data models. ML offers potential, but lacks proper characterization and rigorous comparisons.

Method: A CTF is introduced with curated datasets at global, crustal, and local scales. It includes task-specific metrics for forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints like noise.

Result: CTF scores evaluate various ML methods and foundation models for seismic wavefield reconstruction. Results highlight strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes.

Conclusion: The CTF aims to standardize evaluations and improve rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML, replacing ad hoc comparisons with structured benchmarks.

Abstract: Seismology faces fundamental challenges in state forecasting and reconstruction (e.g., earthquake early warning and ground motion prediction) and managing the parametric variability of source locations, mechanisms, and Earth models (e.g., subsurface structure and topography effects). Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes. Our vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, raising the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.

### [161] [Conditional Adversarial Fragility in Financial Machine Learning under Macroeconomic Stress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19935)
*Samruddhi Baviskar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, showing adversarial vulnerability worsens during economic stress periods. It proposes a regime-aware framework to evaluate robustness in financial ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial ML models face nonstationary environments, but adversarial robustness is often tested statically. The paper addresses this gap by examining robustness under macroeconomic stress.

Method: The study uses volatility-based regime segmentation to assess model behavior across calm and stress periods, keeping attack methods and evaluation protocols consistent. It also introduces a semantic auditing layer using LLMs.

Result: Models show comparable baseline performance across regimes but suffer significantly greater adversarial degradation during stress periods, especially in predictive accuracy and false negative rates.

Conclusion: Adversarial robustness in financial ML is regime-dependent, highlighting the need for stress-aware risk assessment approaches.

Abstract: Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series forecasting faces challenges like limited training data, noisy dynamics, and underutilized auxiliary variables. Existing models struggle with high-frequency noise and long-term trends.

Method: LoFT-LLM uses a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) for low-frequency trends, a residual learner for high-frequency variations, and an LLM for semantic refinement with auxiliary context.

Result: Experiments show LoFT-LLM outperforms baselines in financial and energy datasets, excelling in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: LoFT-LLM effectively addresses forecasting challenges by integrating low-frequency learning and LLM-based semantic calibration.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI) to unify two estimators (DSI and TSI) using control variates, minimizing variance across noise levels and improving sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models need accurate score estimation for sampling, but existing estimators (DSI and TSI) face a variance trade-off: DSI struggles with low-noise, and TSI with high-noise regimes.

Method: Proposes CVSI, unifying DSI and TSI via control variates with an optimal, time-dependent coefficient to minimize variance across noise levels.

Result: CVSI proves effective as a low-variance plug-in estimator, enhancing sample efficiency in sampler learning and diffusion sampling.

Conclusion: CVSI provides a principled solution to the variance trade-off, improving diffusion model performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

TL;DR: Summary


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing class imbalance in deep learning classifiers to improve performance without needing label information.

Method: Introduces OGAB, a novel activation function with orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance on imbalanced datasets by preserving minority class information and enhancing class separability.

Conclusion: OGAB effectively tackles class imbalance during training, offering better performance than traditional and learnable activation functions.

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

### [166] [An Optimal Policy for Learning Controllable Dynamics by Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20053)
*Peter N. Loxley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in unknown environments, focusing on efficient exploration over limited time horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of optimizing exploration strategies in controllable Markov chains, which are fundamental in sequential decision-making tasks like reinforcement learning and optimal control.

Method: The authors propose a simple, efficient-to-compute policy that maximizes information gain greedily by selecting controls from a dynamically changing constraint set. They provide a parameterization for controls and an algorithm for finding the optimal policy.

Result: The policy is shown to be optimal through counting arguments, comparisons with suboptimal policies, and dynamic programming principles. Six detailed examples of controllable dynamics illustrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Non-stationary policies are essential for optimal exploration due to certain restrictive states (e.g., transient or absorbing states). The proposed policy is practical and outperforms alternatives.

Abstract: Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.

*Mingue Park,Jisung Hwang,Seungwoo Yoo,Kyeongmin Yeo,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PairFlow is a lightweight preprocessing step for Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) that enables few-step sampling without needing a pretrained teacher, addressing their slow sampling issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFMs perform well for discrete data but suffer from slow sampling due to iterative processes. Existing acceleration methods rely on finetuning, adding training overhead.

Method: PairFlow uses closed-form inversion for DFMs to create paired source-target samples efficiently, eliminating the need for pretrained teachers.

Result: PairFlow achieves performance comparable to or better than finetuning-heavy methods, with only 1.7% of the compute cost.

Conclusion: PairFlow is a cost-effective and broadly applicable solution for accelerating DFMs, also enhancing subsequent distillation potential.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{PairFlow}$, a lightweight preprocessing step for training Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) to achieve few-step sampling without requiring a pretrained teacher. DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

### [168] [QE-Catalytic: A Graph-Language Multimodal Base Model for Relaxed-Energy Prediction in Catalytic Adsorption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20084)
*Yanjie Li,Jian Xu,Xueqing Chen,Lina Yu,Shiming Xiang,Weijun Li,Cheng-lin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QE-Catalytic is proposed as a multimodal framework integrating a language model and an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer to enhance adsorption-energy prediction and catalyst design, achieving improved accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of adsorption energy is crucial for catalyst screening, but existing language-model-based approaches fall short in accuracy and configuration distinction.

Method: QE-Catalytic combines Qwen (language model) and Equiformer-V2 (E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer) to leverage 3D structures and text descriptions, enabling joint prediction and inverse design.

Result: On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713 eV to 0.486 eV, outperforming baselines like CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa.

Conclusion: QE-Catalytic demonstrates superior performance in adsorption-energy prediction and catalyst design, highlighting the benefits of multimodal integration.

Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.
  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

*Jeehong Kim,Youngseok Hwang,Minchan Kim,Sungho Bae,Hyunwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in maritime traffic is introduced, addressing challenges in spatio-temporal graph construction due to lack of fixed nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the difficulty of anomaly detection in non-grid environments like maritime traffic, where fixed spatial nodes are absent.

Method: Extends OMTAD into a benchmark with node-, edge-, and graph-level anomalies, using LLM-based agents for trajectory synthesis and anomaly injection.

Result: Creates a benchmark for systematic evaluation of anomaly detection methods in non-grid spatio-temporal systems.

Conclusion: Expected to enhance reproducibility and advance anomaly detection methodologies in unstructured domains.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in structured domains such as road traffic and public transportation, where spatial entities can be naturally represented as fixed nodes. In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies in the Multi-Armed Bandit problem, focusing on two-state Bernoulli bandits. It extends IDS to discounted infinite-horizon settings, analyzing symmetric bandits and one-fair-coin scenarios, showing bounded and logarithmic regret, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously compare heuristic strategies like IDS against the optimal policy in tractable environments, bridging reinforcement learning and information theory for statistical physicists.

Method: Extends the IDS framework with a modified information measure and tuning parameter, tested in symmetric bandits and one-fair-coin scenarios.

Result: IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret in symmetric cases and logarithmic regret scaling in one-fair-coin scenarios, aligning with asymptotic lower bounds.

Conclusion: The work synthesizes concepts for pedagogical purposes, demonstrating IDS efficacy in specific bandit environments.

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.

### [171] [Sample-Efficient Policy Constraint Offline Deep Reinforcement Learning based on Sample Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20115)
*Yuanhao Chen,Qi Liu,Pengbin Chen,Zhongjian Qiao,Yanjie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sample filtering method to improve offline RL by focusing on high-reward transitions, enhancing learning speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing policy constraint offline RL methods suffer from slow learning and inefficiency due to reliance on low-reward transitions in datasets.

Method: A sample filtering method evaluates transitions by average and discounted rewards, using high-score samples for training.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms baselines in offline RL algorithms and tasks.

Conclusion: Filtering high-reward transitions improves sample efficiency and performance in offline RL.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.

TL;DR: NeuralCrop, a hybrid model combining process-based GGCMs and machine learning, outperforms traditional GGCMs and pure ML models in crop yield predictions, especially under extreme conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainties in traditional GGCMs and the limitations of pure machine learning models in predicting crop yields under climate change.

Method: Hybrid approach integrating an advanced process-based GGCM with data-driven ML components, trained first to emulate GGCM and then fine-tuned on observational data.

Result: NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs and pure ML models, especially in reproducing interannual yield anomalies and under drought extremes.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach offers improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and extreme weather conditions.

Abstract: Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) simulate daily crop growth by explicitly representing key biophysical processes and project end-of-season yield time series. They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in federated learning like non-IID data, malicious participants, and high cross-cloud communication costs.

Method: Introduces gradient-based Shapley value computation for reputation evaluation and cost-aware aggregation prioritizing intra-cloud communication.

Result: Achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients and reduces communication costs by 32%.

Conclusion: Practical for real-world multi-cloud deployments due to stable performance across varying conditions.

Abstract: Federated learning across multi-cloud environments faces critical challenges, including non-IID data distributions, malicious participant detection, and substantial cross-cloud communication costs (egress fees). Existing Byzantine-robust methods focus primarily on model accuracy while overlooking the economic implications of data transfer across cloud providers. This paper presents Cost-TrustFL, a hierarchical federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model performance and communication costs while providing robust defense against poisoning attacks. We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains stable performance across varying non-IID degrees and attack intensities, making it practical for real-world multi-cloud deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores offline multitask reinforcement learning, focusing on shared low-rank representations of action-value functions to improve efficiency and generalization. It analyzes a multitask version of fitted Q-iteration under standard assumptions, showing improved accuracy with pooled data and benefits for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage shared structure among tasks in offline reinforcement learning for better statistical efficiency and generalization, addressing the lack of online interaction.

Method: A multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration is used to jointly learn shared representations and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data.

Result: Finite-sample generalization guarantees are established, showing improved estimation accuracy with pooled data ($1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence) and reduced complexity for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Shared representations enhance multitask offline Q-learning, offering theoretical insights into their benefits for model-free, value-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: We study offline multitask reinforcement learning in settings where multiple tasks share a low-rank representation of their action-value functions. In this regime, a learner is provided with fixed datasets collected from several related tasks, without access to further online interaction, and seeks to exploit shared structure to improve statistical efficiency and generalization. We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate load forecasting across multiple entities is vital for power systems, but existing methods lack adaptability to dynamic patterns and correlations.

Method: The method uses vector-valued hidden Markov models with a recursive process to update parameters and provide probabilistic predictions.

Result: The technique outperforms existing methods in forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment, validated on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The adaptive multi-task learning approach enhances probabilistic load forecasting by dynamically capturing changes and correlations among entities.

Abstract: Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.

TL;DR: The paper explores how sampling algorithms and hyperparameters in diffusion models influence bias amplification, showing they can reduce or amplify biases even with fixed trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite their performance, diffusion models often replicate dataset biases, but the role of sampling algorithms in this process is not well understood.

Method: Controlled studies using Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST, BFFHQ, and Stable Diffusion to analyze the impact of sampling hyperparameters on bias.

Result: Sampling hyperparameters significantly affect bias amplification, with potential for both reduction and amplification.

Conclusion: Understanding and optimizing sampling algorithms can help mitigate bias amplification in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various image synthesis tasks, yet their tendency to replicate and amplify dataset biases remains poorly understood. Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal brain decoding struggles with cross-subject generalization and interpretability, which the study aims to resolve.

Method: BrainROI introduces a new fMRI encoder with soft-ROI and Voxel-gate fusion, interpretable prompt optimization, and parameterized decoding constraints.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in metrics like BLEU-4 and CIDEr under cross-subject settings.

Conclusion: BrainROI advances brain-captioning by improving transferability, interpretability, and generation quality.

Abstract: Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop fast, accurate emulators for moving boundary systems like Darcy flow, enabling their use in digital twin platforms for real-time monitoring and control of processes like RTM.

Method: Uses DeepONet to create a surrogate model for moving boundary problems, coupled with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) for Bayesian inverse problems. Validated with synthetic and experimental RTM data.

Result: DeepONet accelerates inversion significantly, enabling real-time, high-resolution parameter estimation (permeability, porosity). Generalizes across domains without retraining.

Conclusion: The approach advances practical industrial deployment of digital twins by providing efficient, accurate, and flexible modeling of moving boundary flows.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.
  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN solutions for Neural SDEs face challenges like high computational costs and unstable training due to discriminators like Neural CDEs.

Method: HGAN-SDEs use Neural Hermite functions to create a lightweight yet expressive discriminator, addressing these limitations.

Result: The framework shows universal approximation for SDE-driven distributions, with superior sample quality and efficiency in experiments.

Conclusion: HGAN-SDEs offer a computationally efficient and stable solution for learning SDE-driven distributions, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) provide a principled framework for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes and have been widely adopted in fields ranging from physics to finance. Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs

*Yuxing Gan,Ziyu Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CDSP-MoE introduces a dynamic expert instantiation framework within shared parameter spaces to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and instruction-overfitting in MoE architectures, using gradient conflicts for structural pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of contemporary MoE designs—structural parameter isolation causing catastrophic forgetting and instruction-overfitting degrading performance in instruction-free scenarios.

Method: Proposes CDSP-MoE, leveraging the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis and learnable topology masks to carve logical experts from a shared backbone. Uses a Lagged Gradient Game to prune conflicting pathways dynamically.

Result: Demonstrates robust content-driven routing without task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even in blind inference scenarios.

Conclusion: CDSP-MoE effectively addresses MoE limitations by enabling dynamic expert instantiation and conflict-driven pruning, improving robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve parameter efficiency through conditional computation, yet contemporary designs suffer from two fundamental limitations: structural parameter isolation that causes catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

TL;DR: TableGPT-R1 is a specialized tabular model using RL to enhance multi-step reasoning and code execution for table tasks, outperforming baselines while retaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs fine-tuned via SFT struggle with complex reasoning and code execution for real-world table tasks. RL can improve these but faces hurdles like scarce trajectories, heterogeneous feedback, and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Develops TableGPT-R1 with a systematic RL framework, including a data pipeline for agentic trajectories, a task-adaptive reward system, and multi-stage training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, outperforming baselines while maintaining general capabilities.

Conclusion: TableGPT-R1 successfully addresses RL challenges in tabular tasks, advancing reasoning and execution capabilities.

Abstract: Tabular data serves as the backbone of modern data analysis and scientific research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

### [182] [FedDPC : Handling Data Heterogeneity and Partial Client Participation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20329)
*Mrinmay Sen,Subhrajit Nag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDPC is a novel FL method addressing data heterogeneity and partial client participation by projecting local updates and using adaptive scaling, improving training stability and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity and partial client participation in FL cause variance in model updates, degrading global model performance. Existing work mainly addresses data heterogeneity, leaving partial participation understudied.

Method: FedDPC mitigates variance by projecting local updates onto the previous global update and employs adaptive scaling for faster training.

Result: Experiments on image classification tasks show FedDPC reduces training loss faster and improves test accuracy compared to state-of-the-art FL methods.

Conclusion: FedDPC effectively addresses both challenges, enhancing FL training stability and global model performance.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

TL;DR: Physics-based machine learning combines domain knowledge with data-driven techniques to improve model accuracy and robustness. Applied to ALICE experiment simulations, it introduces a novel loss function and scaling mechanism, outperforming traditional methods and speeding up simulations significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and robustness of simulations for the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) in the ALICE experiment at CERN by embedding physics knowledge into machine learning models.

Method: Uses Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, with a novel loss function and output variability-based scaling mechanism to improve spatial distribution representation and reduce rare artefact impact.

Result: The approach outperforms classic data-driven methods and achieves a 421-fold speedup compared to existing NF implementations in ZDC simulations.

Conclusion: Physics-based machine learning, when combined with novel techniques like scaling mechanisms and teacher-student frameworks, significantly enhances simulation accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Physics-based machine learning blends traditional science with modern data-driven techniques. Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training. Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

*Dogan Altan,Hamza Haruna Mohammed,Glenn Terje Lines,Dusica Marijan,Arnbjørn Maressa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid physics-guided neural network improves shaft power prediction for vessels, outperforming traditional empirical formulas and baseline neural networks in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of vessel shaft power is crucial for optimizing fuel consumption and reducing costs and emissions in maritime operations. Traditional empirical formulas struggle with dynamic conditions, prompting the need for a more robust method.

Method: A hybrid approach combining neural networks with empirical formulas is proposed, leveraging the strengths of both techniques to model dynamic conditions like sea states and vessel fouling.

Result: The physics-guided neural network achieves lower prediction errors (mean absolute error, root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error) compared to empirical formulas and baseline neural networks, tested on data from four cargo vessels.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that integrating physics into neural networks enhances shaft power prediction accuracy, offering better performance than traditional or purely data-driven methods.

Abstract: Optimizing maritime operations, particularly fuel consumption for vessels, is crucial, considering its significant share in global trade. As fuel consumption is closely related to the shaft power of a vessel, predicting shaft power accurately is a crucial problem that requires careful consideration to minimize costs and emissions. Traditional approaches, which incorporate empirical formulas, often struggle to model dynamic conditions, such as sea conditions or fouling on vessels. In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Field-Space attention, a novel mechanism for Earth system Transformers that operates directly on continuous geophysical fields, preserving their geometric structure for interpretability and scientific constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for machine-learning architectures that model Earth system dynamics accurately while preserving geometric structure and enabling interpretability.

Method: Uses Field-Space attention, maintaining continuous fields on the sphere, employs a fixed multiscale decomposition, and learns structure-preserving deformations.

Result: Field-Space Transformers converge faster and more stably than Vision Transformers and U-Nets, requiring fewer parameters and improving fidelity.

Conclusion: Field-Space Attention is a promising, interpretable, and efficient building block for future Earth system prediction and generative modeling.

Abstract: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure. Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Clust-PSI-PFL is a clustering-based personalized federated learning framework that uses PSI to handle non-IID data, improving accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-IID data in federated learning biases model updates and reduces performance. Addressing this issue is crucial for robust personalized FL.

Method: Proposes Clust-PSI-PFL, using PSI to quantify non-IID data, and forms homogeneous client groups via K-means++. Optimal clusters are chosen systematically.

Result: Achieves up to 18% higher global accuracy and 37% better client fairness across diverse datasets and partition protocols.

Conclusion: PSI-guided clustering is effective for robust personalized FL under label skew, balancing accuracy and fairness with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling in complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.

Method: Uses GALE for physics-aware self-attention and cross-attention, multi-scale ball queries, and persistent projection of geometry/global/boundary conditions into state spaces.

Result: Outperforms Domino, Transolver, and AB-UPT in accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency on benchmarks like DrivAerML and Luminary SHIFT.

Conclusion: GeoTransolver advances surrogate modeling by unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention.

Abstract: We present GeoTransolver, a Multiscale Geometry-Aware Physics Attention Transformer for CAE that replaces standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to a shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context computed from multi-scale ball queries (inspired by DoMINO) and reused in every block. Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.

*Xuan-An Le,Minh-Nam Tran,Son Nguyen*

TL;DR: BRIDGE distills knowledge from large models to tiny ones efficiently by using a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA) to bridge the capacity gap, reducing costs and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the impracticality of direct knowledge transfer from large proprietary models (like GPT-4) to tiny deployable models due to high API costs and capacity mismatches.

Method: A two-phase framework: (1) Train a TA on minimal data (3-5%) selected via zero-cost pipeline; (2) Use TA to generate synthetic rationales for full dataset to train the tiny student with instruction-tuning.

Result: BRIDGE achieves 28-41% student performance gains, closes the capability gap by 12-16%, and uses 10x fewer teacher queries than direct distillation.

Conclusion: BRIDGE offers a cost-effective solution for knowledge distillation, outperforming direct methods while using fewer resources.

Abstract: Distilling knowledge from large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) to tiny deployable models (less than 1B parameters) faces a critical capacity-budget trap: the 1000x capacity gap between teachers and students prevents effective direct transfer, while API costs prohibit extensive data collection. We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.

TL;DR: Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TSσBN) simplifies MTL by replacing shared normalization, improving performance and interpretability without complex designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in MTL like resource balancing and interference, the paper explores simplification through normalization layers rather than elaborate architectures.

Method: Proposes TSσBN, a lightweight task-specific normalization that soft-allocates network capacity while sharing feature extractors.

Result: TSσBN improves stability and performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, remaining parameter-efficient.

Conclusion: Complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary; task-specific normalization provides a simpler, interpretable, and efficient alternative.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to leverage shared knowledge across tasks to improve generalization and parameter efficiency, yet balancing resources and mitigating interference remain open challenges. Architectural solutions often introduce elaborate task-specific modules or routing schemes, increasing complexity and overhead. In this work, we show that normalization layers alone are sufficient to address many of these challenges. Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships. Our findings suggest that complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary and that task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User frustration in mobile apps and websites can lead to lost sales; predicting it helps improve user experience.

Method: Analyzed 5.4M clickstream events (304,881 sessions) using tabular features (XGBoost) and event sequences (LSTM).

Result: XGBoost: 90% accuracy, 0.9579 ROC AUC; LSTM: 91% accuracy, 0.9705 ROC AUC. LSTM predicts reliably after 20-30 interactions.

Conclusion: Predicting frustration early improves user experience; LSTM outperforms XGBoost.

Abstract: Many businesses depend on their mobile apps and websites, so user frustration while trying to complete a task on these channels can cause lost sales and complaints. In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably.

TL;DR: SHAPformer is a fast, accurate, and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on Transformers, addressing SHAP's limitations for time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainability is crucial for trust and transparency in time-series forecasts, but existing methods like SHAP lack efficiency and assumptions for time-series data.

Method: SHAPformer uses Transformer architecture and attention manipulation to predict based on feature subsets, eliminating the need for sampling counterfactuals.

Result: SHAPformer generates explanations in under a second, outperforming SHAP Permutation Explainer in speed. It provides accurate explanations on synthetic data and meaningful insights on real-world electrical load data.

Conclusion: SHAPformer offers a significant improvement in explainability for time-series forecasting, combining speed, accuracy, and meaningful insights.

Abstract: Time-series forecasts are essential for planning and decision-making in many domains. Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period.

TL;DR: FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework, dynamically adapts speculation length to achieve lossless acceleration of AR LLMs, offering significant speedups over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the speed of diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) for speculative decoding while overcoming their inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff.

Method: FailFast uses parallel decoding from dLLMs to minimize rejection risks and adapts speculation length dynamically ('fails fast' in hard regions, 'wins big' in easy ones).

Result: Achieves up to 4.9x speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7x over naive dLLM drafters, and 1.4x over EAGLE-3, without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: FailFast effectively harnesses dLLMs' strengths for speculative decoding, providing practical and scalable speed improvements.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Performative Policy Gradient (PePG), the first RL algorithm designed to handle performative distribution shifts caused by the algorithm itself, proving its convergence to optimal policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL methods ignore distribution shifts induced by their own actions, limiting their effectiveness in performative settings.

Method: The authors prove performative versions of key RL theorems and introduce PePG, which accounts for performativity under softmax parametrization with and without entropy regularization.

Result: PePG converges to performatively optimal policies and outperforms standard and existing performative RL algorithms empirically.

Conclusion: PePG advances performative RL by achieving optimality, not just stability, addressing a critical gap in the field.

Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

*Leslie Barrett,Michael W. Sherman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to evaluate and improve hand-tagged training data quality using statistical consistency and agreement metrics, emphasizing iterative tagging and variance trends as quality indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training data quality is crucial for machine learning but often overlooked, despite significant variability in tagging exercises.

Method: Statistical approaches measure tagging consistency and agreement, with iterative tagging and variance analysis as key techniques.

Result: Agreement metrics are more reliable when recorded over multiple iterations; declining variance indicates better quality. Burn-in periods may not suffice to minimize errors.

Conclusion: Tagging projects can achieve high-quality data without multiple tags per item, leveraging iterative methods and statistical analysis.

Abstract: Hand-tagged training data is essential to many machine learning tasks. However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a game-theoretic framework for understanding neural networks, enabling robustness verification, output bounds, and inverse game-based training.

Method: Translate ReLU network evaluation into a stopping game, use Shapley-Bellman recursion, derive path-integral formulas, and extend to Softplus networks via entropic regularization.

Result: Established game-theoretic representation allows output bounds, robustness verification, and inverse game training for neural networks.

Conclusion: ReLU and Softplus networks can be analyzed and trained using game theory, offering new tools for verification and optimization.

Abstract: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'internal RL,' a method using higher-order models to explore within autoregressive models' internal representations for efficient learning with sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming inefficient token-by-token exploration in RL-finetuned autoregressive models, especially with sparse rewards.

Method: Introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model to control the base autoregressive model's residual stream activations, discovering temporally-abstract actions.

Result: Higher-order models compress activation sequences into controllers enabling efficient exploration and learning from sparse rewards where standard RL fails.

Conclusion: Internal RL, exploiting latent actions and reinforcement in autoregressive models, shows promise for hierarchical RL in foundation models.

Abstract: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical framework explaining simplicity bias in neural networks, showing how gradient descent learns increasingly complex solutions via saddle-to-saddle dynamics across various architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify theoretical understanding of simplicity bias observed in neural networks trained with gradient descent, which lacks a cohesive explanation despite widespread empirical evidence.

Method: Develops a framework analyzing saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for neural networks (fully-connected, convolutional, attention-based). Examines fixed points, invariant manifolds, and gradient descent behavior.

Result: Demonstrates that networks learn solutions of increasing complexity (e.g., rank, kinks, kernels, heads) via saddle-to-saddle transitions. Clarifies the role of data distribution and initialization in learning plateaus.

Conclusion: Provides a unifying theory explaining why gradient descent progressively learns more complex solutions, disentangling factors influencing learning dynamics.

Abstract: Neural networks trained with gradient descent often learn solutions of increasing complexity over time, a phenomenon known as simplicity bias. Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.
