### [1] [Characterizing Motion Encoding in Video Diffusion Timesteps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22175)
*Vatsal Baherwani,Yixuan Ren,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how motion and appearance are encoded in text-to-video diffusion models across timesteps, identifying distinct regimes for each and simplifying motion customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand how motion is encoded in video diffusion models, as current reliance on empirical heuristics lacks characterization.

Method: Proxies motion encoding by editing conditions over timestep ranges, conducting a large-scale study to quantify the trade-off between motion preservation and appearance editing.

Result: Identifies early motion-dominant and later appearance-dominant regimes, enabling simplified motion customization without extra modules.

Conclusion: Transforms heuristic insights into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, offering a practical integration for motion transfer and editing methods.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models synthesize temporal motion and spatial appearance through iterative denoising, yet how motion is encoded across timesteps remains poorly understood. Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture combining 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system processes webcam video streams to recognize word-level ASL signs, addressing communication barriers for over 70 million deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals worldwide. Our architecture leverages 3D convolutions to capture spatial-temporal features from video frames, followed by LSTM layers that model sequential dependencies inherent in sign language gestures.

### [4] [Unbiased Visual Reasoning with Controlled Visual Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22183)
*Zhaonan Li,Shijie Lu,Fei Wang,Jacob Dineen,Xiao Ye,Zhikun Xu,Siyi Liu,Young Min Cho,Bangzheng Li,Daniel Chang,Kenny Nguyen,Qizheng Yang,Muhao Chen,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA is a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning in VLMs to reduce reliance on spurious correlations, improving robustness and visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs often rely on spurious correlations rather than causal visual evidence, especially after fine-tuning. VISTA aims to address this by separating perception and reasoning.

Method: VISTA uses a frozen VLM sensor for short perception queries and a text-only LLM reasoner for decomposition, query planning, and aggregation. It trains unbiased reasoning via reinforcement learning.

Result: VISTA improves robustness (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B, +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B) on SpuriVerse, remains competitive on other benchmarks, and handles VLM perception failures well.

Conclusion: VISTA effectively reduces reliance on spurious correlations, enhances visual reasoning, and generalizes across unseen VLM sensors.

Abstract: End-to-end Vision-language Models (VLMs) often answer visual questions by exploiting spurious correlations instead of causal visual evidence, and can become more shortcut-prone when fine-tuned. We introduce VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning via an explicit information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures. Human analysis further shows that VISTA's reasoning traces are more neutral, less reliant on spurious attributes, and more explicitly grounded in visual evidence than end-to-end VLM baselines.

### [5] [SAMM2D: Scale-Aware Multi-Modal 2D Dual-Encoder for High-Sensitivity Intracrania Aneurysm Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22185)
*Antara Titikhsha,Divyanshu Tak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework, improves aneurysm detection with strong pretraining, outperforming augmented models and clinical baselines, achieving high sensitivity and cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in aneurysm detection like subtle morphology, class imbalance, and scarce annotated data.

Method: Introduces SAMM2D, leveraging ImageNet-pretrained features without data augmentation, tested across six augmentation regimes.

Result: Achieves AUC of 0.686, outperforms augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points, and reaches 95% sensitivity with projected cost savings.

Conclusion: Strong pretraining is more beneficial than complex augmentation in medical imaging workflows.

Abstract: Effective aneurysm detection is essential to avert life-threatening hemorrhages, but it remains challenging due to the subtle morphology of the aneurysm, pronounced class imbalance, and the scarcity of annotated data. We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that "more augmentation is always better" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold. By calibrating the decision threshold, SAMM2D reaches 95% sensitivity, surpassing average radiologist performance, and translates to a projected \$13.9M in savings per 1,000 patients in screening applications. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that 85% of true positives attend to relevant vascular regions (62% IoU with expert annotations), demonstrating the model's clinically meaningful focus. Our results suggest that future medical imaging workflows could benefit more from strong pretraining than from increasingly complex augmentation pipelines.

### [6] [HookMIL: Revisiting Context Modeling in Multiple Instance Learning for Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22188)
*Xitong Ling,Minxi Ouyang,Xiaoxiao Li,Jiawen Li,Ying Chen,Yuxuan Sun,Xinrui Chen,Tian Guan,Xiaoping Liu,Yonghong He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HookMIL is a context-aware, efficient MIL framework using hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation in computational pathology, outperforming traditional and transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MIL loses contextual info, while transformer-based methods are computationally heavy. HookMIL aims to balance expressiveness and efficiency.

Method: HookMIL uses learnable hook tokens initialized from visual, textual, or spatial features for contextual aggregation. It includes bidirectional attention, diversity loss, and hook-to-hook communication.

Result: HookMIL achieves SOTA performance on four pathology datasets, with better efficiency and interpretability.

Conclusion: HookMIL successfully combines context-awareness and computational efficiency, advancing weakly supervised WSI analysis.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has enabled weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

### [7] [Tiny-YOLOSAM: Fast Hybrid Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22193)
*Kenneth Xu,Songhan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tiny-YOLOSAM combines YOLOv12 with TinySAM for faster, more efficient segmentation by using box prompts and sparse point prompts instead of dense 'segment-everything' prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The SAM model is computationally expensive, and TinySAM, while lighter, is still slow in 'segment-everything' mode. This work aims to improve efficiency and speed for full-scene segmentation.

Method: Proposes Tiny-YOLOSAM, a hybrid pipeline using YOLOv12 for box prompts and sparse point prompts for uncovered regions, reducing computational load.

Result: On COCO val2017, improves AR (16.4% to 77.1%) and mIoU (19.2% to 67.8%), while reducing runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x faster).

Conclusion: Detector-guided prompting with sparse sampling is an effective alternative to dense prompting for practical full-scene segmentation.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables promptable, high-quality segmentation but is often too computationally expensive for latency-critical settings. TinySAM is a lightweight, distilled SAM variant that preserves strong zero-shot mask quality, yet its "segment-everything" mode still requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice. We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU. These results suggest detector-guided prompting combined with targeted sparse sampling as an effective alternative to dense "segment-everything" prompting for practical full-scene segmentation.

### [8] [Quadrant Segmentation VLM with Few-Shot Adaptation and OCT Learning-based Explainability Methods for Diabetic Retinopathy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22197)
*Shivum Telang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal explainability model using a VLM with few-shot learning to diagnose Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) by analyzing lesion distributions in retinal images, enhancing interpretability and clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early DR detection is crucial but hindered by limited physician access and impractical manual lesion annotation. Current AI models lack comprehensive explainability and rely on单一 imaging modalities.

Method: The model pairs Grad-CAM heatmaps across OCT and fundus images, leveraging few-shot learning to mimic ophthalmologist reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions in retinal quadrants.

Result: Tested on 3,000 fundus and 1,000 OCT images, the model visually highlights DR-contributing regions, improving diagnostic accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach overcomes current limitations, offering a practical tool for DR screening, treatment, and research, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, requiring early detection to preserve sight. Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification. Using a dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images, this innovative methodology addresses key limitations in current DR diagnostics, offering a practical and comprehensive tool for improving patient outcomes.

### [9] [TCFormer: A 5M-Parameter Transformer with Density-Guided Aggregation for Weakly-Supervised Crowd Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22203)
*Qiang Guo,Rubo Zhang,Bingbing Zhang,Junjie Liu,Jianqing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCFormer is a lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting model with 5M parameters, achieving competitive accuracy using global counts and density-level classification loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses scalability and deployment challenges in crowd counting by reducing reliance on labor-intensive annotations and computationally heavy models.

Method: Uses a vision transformer for feature extraction, a Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module for spatial adaptation, and density-level classification loss for regularization.

Result: Achieves superior trade-off between efficiency and accuracy on benchmarks like ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU.

Conclusion: TCFormer is effective for edge device deployment due to its lightweight design and weakly-supervised training.

Abstract: Crowd counting typically relies on labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally intensive backbones, restricting its scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.

### [10] [A CNN-Based Malaria Diagnosis from Blood Cell Images with SHAP and LIME Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22205)
*Md. Ismiel Hossen Abir,Awolad Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes a deep learning-based CNN model for malaria diagnosis, achieving 96% accuracy and high precision/recall, outperforming traditional methods and other architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malaria diagnosis lacks sensitivity and accessibility in remote areas due to reliance on expert judgment and limited resources.

Method: A custom CNN is developed and compared with ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. Explainable AI techniques (SHAP, LIME, Saliency Maps) enhance interpretability.

Result: The model achieves 96% accuracy and >0.95 precision/recall for both parasitized and uninfected classes.

Conclusion: Deep learning offers accurate, fast, and interpretable malaria diagnosis, suitable for resource-limited regions.

Abstract: Malaria remains a prevalent health concern in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic blood smear analysis, are low in sensitivity, depend on expert judgment, and require resources that may not be available in remote settings. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected. The model achieves an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes. This study also compares the custom CNN with established deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. To enhance model interpretability, Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Saliency Maps are applied. The proposed system shows how deep learning can provide quick, accurate and understandable malaria diagnosis, especially in areas with limited resources.

*Naichuan Zheng,Xiahai Lun,Weiyi Li,Yuchen Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Signal-SGN++ is a spiking graph framework combining SNNs and GCNs for energy-efficient action recognition, achieving competitive accuracy with reduced energy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between GCNs' high energy costs and SNNs' limitations in capturing motion dependencies by integrating spiking dynamics with topological awareness.

Method: Uses 1D-SGC and FSC for feature extraction, TSSA for adaptive attention routing, and MWTF with TATF for multi-resolution spectral fusion.

Result: Outperforms SNN methods and matches GCN accuracy with lower energy consumption in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Signal-SGN++ effectively balances accuracy and energy efficiency for action recognition.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) demonstrate strong capability in modeling skeletal topology for action recognition, yet their dense floating-point computations incur high energy costs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.

Result: OCR-enhanced context improved F1-scores by up to 209%, and the multi-agent framework achieved 75.98% accuracy.

Conclusion: ViSignVQA highlights the need for domain-specific resources in low-resource languages and serves as a benchmark for OCR-integrated VQA models.

Abstract: Understanding signboard text in natural scenes is essential for real-world applications of Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet remains underexplored, particularly in low-resource languages. We introduce ViSignVQA, the first large-scale Vietnamese dataset designed for signboard-oriented VQA, which comprises 10,762 images and 25,573 question-answer pairs. The dataset captures the diverse linguistic, cultural, and visual characteristics of Vietnamese signboards, including bilingual text, informal phrasing, and visual elements such as color and layout. To benchmark this task, we adapted state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., BLIP-2, LaTr, PreSTU, and SaL) by integrating a Vietnamese OCR model (SwinTextSpotter) and a Vietnamese pretrained language model (ViT5). The experimental results highlight the significant role of the OCR-enhanced context, with F1-score improvements of up to 209% when the OCR text is appended to questions. Additionally, we propose a multi-agent VQA framework combining perception and reasoning agents with GPT-4, achieving 75.98% accuracy via majority voting. Our study presents the first large-scale multimodal dataset for Vietnamese signboard understanding. This underscores the importance of domain-specific resources in enhancing text-based VQA for low-resource languages. ViSignVQA serves as a benchmark capturing real-world scene text characteristics and supporting the development and evaluation of OCR-integrated VQA models in Vietnamese.

### [14] [On Extending Semantic Abstraction for Efficient Search of Hidden Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22220)
*Tasha Pais,Nikhilesh Belulkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Abstraction uses 2D VLMs' relevancy maps as abstract object representations to efficiently learn 3D localization and completion for hidden objects, outperforming random search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve household robots' efficiency in locating hidden (occluded) objects by leveraging semantic abstraction and historical data.

Method: The framework treats 2D VLMs' relevancy activations as confidence-based object representations and uses them to localize and complete hidden objects in 3D space, informed by historical placement data.

Result: The model achieves accurate 3D localization of hidden objects on the first try, significantly faster than naive random search.

Conclusion: Semantic Abstraction enhances robots' ability to locate hidden objects efficiently, saving time and effort.

Abstract: Semantic Abstraction's key observation is that 2D VLMs' relevancy activations roughly correspond to their confidence of whether and where an object is in the scene. Thus, relevancy maps are treated as "abstract object" representations. We use this framework for learning 3D localization and completion for the exclusive domain of hidden objects, defined as objects that cannot be directly identified by a VLM because they are at least partially occluded. This process of localizing hidden objects is a form of unstructured search that can be performed more efficiently using historical data of where an object is frequently placed. Our model can accurately identify the complete 3D location of a hidden object on the first try significantly faster than a naive random search. These extensions to semantic abstraction hope to provide household robots with the skills necessary to save time and effort when looking for lost objects.

### [15] [VideoScaffold: Elastic-Scale Visual Hierarchies for Streaming Video Understanding in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22226)
*Naishan Zheng,Jie Huang,Qingpei Guo,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoScaffold is a dynamic framework for streaming video understanding, addressing fragmentation and redundancy issues in existing methods through adaptive event segmentation and hierarchical consolidation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video understanding struggle with redundancy and incoherence in continuous streams. VideoScaffold aims to dynamically adapt event granularity and preserve visual semantics.

Method: VideoScaffold uses Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES) for dynamic boundary refinement and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC) for semantic aggregation. These components enable smooth transitions from frame-level to event-level reasoning.

Result: VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for both offline and streaming video understanding.

Conclusion: The framework is modular and extends image-based MLLMs effectively to continuous video comprehension, offering a plug-and-play solution.

Abstract: Understanding long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging due to the heavy redundancy across frames and the need for temporally coherent representations. Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension. The code is available at https://github.com/zheng980629/VideoScaffold.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture to overcome limitations in Vision Transformers (ViT) for dense prediction tasks like pose estimation, achieving +2.0 AP improvement over ViTPose-S.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ViT front-end designs, like ViTPose, suffer from simplistic patchification, leading to irreversible information loss and poor handling of multi-scale variations.

Method: The proposed KAN-FPN-Stem replaces the standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution in FPN with a KAN-based convolutional layer for better non-linear modeling during feature fusion.

Result: Experiments on COCO show a +2.0 AP improvement over ViTPose-S, highlighting the importance of feature fusion quality over feature refinement.

Conclusion: The study identifies feature fusion as the performance bottleneck in ViT front-ends and introduces KAN as an effective solution.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated significant promise in dense prediction tasks such as pose estimation. However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic "upsample-and-add" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the "artifacts" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Xiaoling Xu,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiG-DM integrates meta-information and cross-domain priors to improve low-dose PET imaging, outperforming existing methods in quality and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose PET imaging reduces radiation exposure but suffers from noise, reduced contrast, and loss of physiological details. Current methods overlook projection-domain physics and patient-specific meta-information, which are vital for functional-semantic correlation.

Method: MiG-DM uses a meta-information encoding module to convert clinical parameters into semantic prompts and combines projection-domain (sinogram adapter) and image-domain processing.

Result: MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UDPET and clinical datasets, enhancing image quality and preserving physiological details.

Conclusion: MiG-DM effectively addresses low-dose PET imaging challenges by leveraging meta-information and cross-domain synergy, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Low-dose PET imaging is crucial for reducing patient radiation exposure but faces challenges like noise interference, reduced contrast, and difficulty in preserving physiological details. Existing methods often neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information, which are critical for functional-semantic correlation mining. In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering. Experiments on the UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels demonstrate that MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

*Phi-Hung Hoang,Nam-Thuan Trinh,Van-Manh Tran,Thi-Thu-Hong Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid knowledge distillation framework is proposed to create a lightweight CNN for smart agriculture, achieving near-teacher accuracy with reduced computational cost and model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices in smart agriculture by balancing computational efficiency and recognition accuracy.

Method: A customized student model with inverted residual blocks and dense connectivity is trained using multi-objective distillation (hard-label supervision, feature-level, response-level, and self-distillation) guided by a ResNet18 teacher.

Result: The student model achieves 98.56% accuracy (vs. teacher's 98.65%) with 0.68 GFLOPs and 1.07M parameters, outperforming other pretrained models in efficiency and accuracy across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is robust, efficient, and highly deployable for smart agriculture, maintaining high accuracy while significantly reducing computational and memory requirements.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices remains a major challenge in smart agriculture due to the trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy. Consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets further demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential of the proposed framework for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems.

*Aahan Sachdeva,Dhanvinkumar Ganeshkumar,James E. Gallagher,Tyler Treat,Edward J. Oughton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An adaptive framework fuses RGB and LWIR video streams to improve detection in varying light conditions, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB and thermal-based systems have limitations in low-light and lack color/texture, respectively.

Method: Fusion of RGB and LWIR at multiple ratios, trained on 33 YOLO models with 22,000 annotated images.

Result: Best models achieved 92.8% (full-light) and 92.0% (dim-light) confidence, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion enhances detection accuracy and reliability across all illumination levels.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic platforms are playing a growing role across the emergency services sector, supporting missions such as search and rescue operations in disaster zones and reconnaissance. However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant. Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improved detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance.

*Antara Titikhsha,Om Kulkarni,Dharun Muthaiah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using lightweight discriminators to guide text-to-image models for better geometric control, improving semantic alignment by 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models often fail to follow strict geometric constraints, highlighting a semantic gap between human perception and generative models.

Method: Proposes Human Perception Embedding (HPE) trained on THINGS triplet dataset, injecting its gradients into latent diffusion processes to separate geometry and style.

Result: Demonstrates improved semantic alignment (80% better) and zero-shot transfer of complex shapes onto conflicting materials across three architectures.

Conclusion: Small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enhancing geometric control and expanding creative possibilities in text-to-image synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate highly detailed textures, yet they often rely on surface appearance and fail to follow strict geometric constraints, particularly when those constraints conflict with the style implied by the text prompt. This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-Σ. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.

Conclusion: GeCo provides a reliable, interpretable metric for detecting and mitigating geometric inconsistencies in video generation.

Abstract: We introduce GeCo, a geometry-grounded metric for jointly detecting geometric deformation and occlusion-inconsistency artifacts in static scenes. By fusing residual motion and depth priors, GeCo produces interpretable, dense consistency maps that reveal these artifacts. We use GeCo to systematically benchmark recent video generation models, uncovering common failure modes, and further employ it as a training-free guidance loss to reduce deformation artifacts during video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Bones and Joints Benchmark evaluates AI models on clinical reasoning tasks, revealing gaps in multimodal integration despite high performance on structured questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks don't assess real-world clinical reasoning, so the B&J Benchmark was created to evaluate AI models on tasks mirroring actual patient care.

Method: Developed a benchmark with 1,245 questions from real orthopedics cases, testing 7 clinical tasks. Evaluated 11 VLMs and 6 LLMs against expert ground truth.

Result: Models excelled (>90% accuracy) on structured questions but struggled (<60%) on open-ended multimodal tasks. VLMs had image interpretation flaws and hallucinations.

Conclusion: AI models lack clinical competence for complex reasoning. Deployment should be limited to supportive roles until multimodal integration improves.

Abstract: Background: The rapid integration of foundation models into clinical practice and public health necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their true clinical reasoning capabilities beyond narrow examination success. Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles. Future advancement in core clinical tasks awaits fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fetal-Gauge, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in fetal ultrasound tasks, highlighting their current limitations and the need for domain-specific improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of standardized benchmarks for VLMs in fetal ultrasound imaging due to modality challenges and limited datasets.

Method: Develop Fetal-Gauge, a benchmark with 42,000 images and 93,000 QA pairs, evaluating VLMs on tasks like anatomical identification and clinical diagnosis.

Result: Best-performing VLM achieves only 55% accuracy, showing significant gaps in fetal ultrasound interpretation.

Conclusion: Urgent need for domain-adapted VLMs; Fetal-Gauge provides a foundation for advancing prenatal care deep learning and healthcare accessibility.

Abstract: The growing demand for prenatal ultrasound imaging has intensified a global shortage of trained sonographers, creating barriers to essential fetal health monitoring. Deep learning has the potential to enhance sonographers' efficiency and support the training of new practitioners. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches. Fetal-Gauge establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care and provides a pathway toward addressing global healthcare accessibility challenges. Our benchmark will be publicly available once the paper gets accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often fail in maintaining accuracy and consistency in fast-moving or multi-target scenes, prompting the need for improved techniques.

Method: SirenPose integrates periodic activation properties and geometric priors, enforced by physics-inspired constraints, and uses a large dataset of 600,000 annotated instances for training.

Result: Models with SirenPose show significant improvements in spatiotemporal consistency and outperform prior methods in handling rapid motion and complex scenes.

Conclusion: SirenPose advances dynamic 3D scene reconstruction by enhancing motion modeling accuracy and spatiotemporal coherence.

Abstract: We propose SirenPose, a novel loss function that combines the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with geometric priors derived from keypoint structures to improve the accuracy of dynamic 3D scene reconstruction. Existing approaches often struggle to maintain motion modeling accuracy and spatiotemporal consistency in fast moving and multi target scenes. By introducing physics inspired constraint mechanisms, SirenPose enforces coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We further expand the training dataset to 600,000 annotated instances to support robust learning. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SirenPose achieve significant improvements in spatiotemporal consistency metrics compared to prior methods, showing superior performance in handling rapid motion and complex scene changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) need to operate efficiently under tight constraints like compute, power, and cost while accurately detecting distractions and drowsiness.

Method: The system uses a compact vision model, confounder-aware label design, and temporal decision head to ensure confident, sustained predictions. Training leverages diverse datasets for robustness.

Result: The system achieves 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 and 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring with low latency.

Conclusion: Reliable driver-state perception can enhance human-centered vehicle intelligence, supporting emerging agentic vehicle concepts.

Abstract: In-cabin Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware. Finally, we discuss how reliable in-cabin human-state perception can serve as an upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence, including emerging agentic vehicle concepts.

Motivation: To create a detector resilient to adversarial attacks while providing well-calibrated probabilities and clear evidence under real-world conditions.

Method: Combines red-team training (worst-of-K counter-forensics) with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture (semantic content and forensic residuals), fused via a lightweight adapter, and produces tamper heatmaps with weak supervision.

Result: Achieves near-perfect ranking against attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, and controlled degradation under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The method offers a modular, data-efficient, and deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with reliable probabilities and actionable heatmaps.

Abstract: This work presents an attack-aware deepfake and image-forensics detector designed for robustness, well-calibrated probabilities, and transparent evidence under realistic deployment conditions. The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores. Results demonstrate near-perfect ranking across attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, and controlled degradation under regrain, establishing a modular, data-efficient, and practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps.

Conclusion: PortionNet effectively estimates food nutrition using only RGB images, making it accessible and practical for smartphones.

Abstract: Accurate food nutrition estimation from single images is challenging due to the loss of 3D information. While depth-based methods provide reliable geometry, they remain inaccessible on most smartphones because of depth-sensor requirements. To overcome this challenge, we propose PortionNet, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that learns geometric features from point clouds during training while requiring only RGB images at inference. Our approach employs a dual-mode training strategy where a lightweight adapter network mimics point cloud representations, enabling pseudo-3D reasoning without any specialized hardware requirements. PortionNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on MetaFood3D, outperforming all previous methods in both volume and energy estimation.

TL;DR: VideoZoomer is a dynamic agentic framework enhancing MLLMs' long video understanding by autonomously focusing on critical moments, outperforming existing models efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long video understanding due to limited context windows and static frame selection methods, which miss key details.

Method: VideoZoomer dynamically adjusts visual focus using a temporal zoom tool, starting with low-frame-rate overviews and refining with high-frame-rate clips via multi-turn interaction. Training involves supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: The 7B model shows strong performance across benchmarks, surpassing open-source models and rivaling proprietary systems with superior efficiency.

Conclusion: VideoZoomer's dynamic, interactive approach significantly improves long video understanding and reasoning in MLLMs, offering efficiency and performance gains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks yet remain limited in long video understanding due to the limited context window. Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpotEdit is a training-free framework that selectively updates only modified image regions during diffusion editing, improving efficiency and preserving unedited areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion editing methods uniformly process all tokens, leading to redundant computation and potential degradation of unchanged areas.

Method: SpotEdit uses SpotSelector to identify stable regions and skip their computation, and SpotFusion to blend features adaptively.

Result: SpotEdit reduces unnecessary computation while maintaining high fidelity in unmodified regions.

Conclusion: SpotEdit offers efficient and precise image editing by focusing updates only on modified areas.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models have significantly advanced image editing by encoding conditional images and integrating them into transformer layers. However, most edits involve modifying only small regions, while current methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, causing redundant computation and potentially degrading unchanged areas. This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.

TL;DR: DeMoGen is a compositional training paradigm for decomposing holistic motions into meaningful sub-components using an energy-based diffusion model, with three training variants to encourage decompositional understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on forward modeling (e.g., text-to-motion), but this paper addresses the inverse problem of decomposing complex motions into reusable primitives.

Method: Proposes DeMoGen, an energy-based diffusion model with three variants: DeMoGen-Exp (explicit decomposed prompts), DeMoGen-OSS (orthogonal self-supervised decomposition), and DeMoGen-SC (semantic consistency).

Result: DeMoGen successfully disentangles reusable motion primitives and enables flexible recombination for novel motions, generalizing beyond training data.

Conclusion: The approach advances decompositional learning in motion analysis and introduces a text-decomposed dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Human motions are compositional: complex behaviors can be described as combinations of simpler primitives. However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. We also demonstrate that the decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions, generalizing beyond the training distribution. Additionally, we construct a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training, serving as an extended resource to facilitate text-to-motion generation and motion composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-view VAE framework integrates MRI-derived radiomic features for MGMT promoter methylation classification in GBM, overcoming limitations of unimodal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve non-invasive inference of MGMT promoter methylation in GBM by addressing high feature redundancy and incomplete modality-specific modeling in current radiomics approaches.

Method: A multi-view latent representation learning framework using VAEs encodes T1Gd and FLAIR MRI features independently, fusing them in a compact latent space.

Result: The framework preserves modality-specific information while enabling effective multimodal integration for MGMT promoter methylation classification.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-view VAE approach offers a promising solution for accurate radiogenomic inference in GBM.

Abstract: Non-invasive inference of molecular tumor characteristics from medical imaging is a central goal of radiogenomics, particularly in glioblastoma (GBM), where O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation carries important prognostic and therapeutic significance. Although radiomics-based machine learning methods have shown promise for this task, conventional unimodal and early-fusion approaches are often limited by high feature redundancy and an incomplete modeling of modality-specific information. In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.

*Olaide N. Oyelade,Oliver Hoxey,Yulia Humrye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an end-to-end vision transformer pipeline for HER2 scoring in histopathology images, addressing challenges in tumor localization and HER2 status prediction with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate HER2 protein expression prediction is crucial for cancer treatment, but existing methods lack pixel-level localization and joint analysis of H&E and IHC images.

Method: A vision transformer-based pipeline processes H&E WSIs patch-wise for tumor localization, maps correlated IHC regions, and embeds a clinical HER2 scoring mechanism for pixel-level annotation.

Result: The method achieved 0.94 classification accuracy and 0.933 specificity in HER2 status prediction, comparable to human pathologists.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly analyzing H&E and IHC images using vision transformers for accurate HER2 scoring.

Abstract: The popular use of histopathology images, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), has proven to be useful in detecting tumors. However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring

TL;DR: The paper introduces a perception-inspired pseudo-colouring technique to enhance deep neural networks' explainability and few-shot learning for ECG interpretation, addressing data efficiency and interpretability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of deep neural networks in ECG interpretation, which require large datasets and lack interpretability, hindering clinical reliability.

Method: Uses a pseudo-colouring technique to encode clinically salient ECG features into structured color representations, tested with prototypical networks and ResNet-18 on ECG images.

Result: Achieves discriminative and interpretable feature learning from minimal training examples (1-5), improving attention on clinically relevant ECG features.

Conclusion: Human-like perceptual encoding bridges data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical AI.

Abstract: Machine vision models, particularly deep neural networks, are increasingly applied to physiological signal interpretation, including electrocardiography (ECG), yet they typically require large training datasets and offer limited insight into the causal features underlying their predictions. This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.
  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats. Together, these findings demonstrate that human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in applying MLLMs to 3D scene manipulation by introducing an API for robust function-level updates, specialized visual tools for 3D understanding, and a multi-agent framework for error handling, outperforming baselines on 25 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend MLLMs' capabilities beyond 2D vision-language tasks to complex 3D scene manipulation.

Method: Proposes an MCP-based API for function-level updates, visual tools for scene understanding, and a multi-agent framework for planning, execution, and verification.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on 25 complex 3D object arrangement tasks compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges the gap between MLLMs and precise 3D-aware manipulation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines. Website: vulcan-3d.github.io

TL;DR: Self-E is a novel text-to-image model trained from scratch with a self-evaluation mechanism, enabling any-step inference and bridging gaps between local learning and global matching paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a text-to-image generation model that supports any-step inference without relying on pretrained teachers or traditional diffusion/flow models, addressing limitations of local supervision and distillation-based approaches.

Method: Self-E combines a Flow Matching-like training approach with a self-evaluation mechanism, where the model evaluates its own generated samples using its score estimates, acting as a dynamic self-teacher.

Result: Experiments show Self-E excels in few-step generation, matches state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps, and improves monotonically with more steps, enabling versatile generation in a single model.

Conclusion: Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation without relying on pretrained components.

Abstract: We introduce the Self-Evaluating Model (Self-E), a novel, from-scratch training approach for text-to-image generation that supports any-step inference. Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model. To our knowledge, Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation.

TL;DR: DeFloMat introduces a fast, deterministic generative object detection framework using Conditional Flow Matching, outperforming diffusion-based methods in speed and accuracy for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the latency bottleneck of diffusion-based detectors like DiffusionDet, which are impractical for time-sensitive clinical tasks due to their slow multi-step sampling.

Method: Integrates Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) and Conditional Optimal Transport theory to replace slow stochastic denoising with a deterministic flow field, enabling fast inference via an ODE solver.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (43.32% AP10:50) in just 3 inference steps, outperforming DiffusionDet's performance (31.03% AP10:50 at 4 steps) and improving localization stability.

Conclusion: DeFloMat resolves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off, setting a new standard for rapid and stable object detection in clinical settings.

Abstract: We propose DeFloMat (Detection with Flow Matching), a novel generative object detection framework that addresses the critical latency bottleneck of diffusion-based detectors, such as DiffusionDet, by integrating Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow. This shift enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. We demonstrate the superiority of DeFloMat on a challenging MRE clinical dataset. Crucially, DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy ($43.32\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$) in only $3$ inference steps, which represents a $1.4\times$ performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance ($31.03\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$ at $4$ steps). Furthermore, our deterministic flow significantly enhances localization characteristics, yielding superior Recall and stability in the few-step regime. DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting a new standard for stable and rapid object localization.

TL;DR: Bright-4B, a 4B parameter model, segments subcellular structures from 3D brightfield volumes without fluorescence or heavy post-processing, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust volumetric segmentation of cellular morphology directly from label-free 3D brightfield microscopy, avoiding fluorescence or post-processing.

Method: Combines Native Sparse Attention, HyperConnections, Mixture-of-Experts, and anisotropic patch embedding for geometry-faithful 3D tokenization.

Result: Achieves accurate segmentation of nuclei, mitochondria, and organelles, preserving fine structural detail across datasets.

Conclusion: Bright-4B advances label-free 3D cell mapping, with code and models released for further use.

Abstract: Label-free 3D brightfield microscopy offers a fast and noninvasive way to visualize cellular morphology, yet robust volumetric segmentation still typically depends on fluorescence or heavy post-processing. We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization. The resulting model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone--without fluorescence, auxiliary channels, or handcrafted post-processing. Across multiple confocal datasets, Bright-4B preserves fine structural detail across depth and cell types, outperforming contemporary CNN and Transformer baselines. All code, pretrained weights, and models for downstream finetuning will be released to advance large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FluenceFormer is a transformer-based framework for fluence map prediction in radiotherapy, addressing limitations of CNNs with a two-stage design and a physics-informed loss function, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of capturing long-range dependencies and ensuring physically realizable plans in fluence map prediction.

Method: A two-stage transformer framework: Stage 1 predicts global dose prior from anatomy, Stage 2 refines it with beam geometry. Uses FAR loss for physics-aware optimization.

Result: Achieves 4.5% Energy Error and significant structural fidelity improvements, outperforming CNN and single-stage methods.

Conclusion: FluenceFormer demonstrates superior performance in fluence map prediction, validated across multiple transformer backbones.

Abstract: Fluence map prediction is central to automated radiotherapy planning but remains an ill-posed inverse problem due to the complex relationship between volumetric anatomy and beam-intensity modulation. Convolutional methods in prior work often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, which can lead to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable plans. We introduce \textbf{FluenceFormer}, a backbone-agnostic transformer framework for direct, geometry-aware fluence regression. The model uses a unified two-stage design: Stage~1 predicts a global dose prior from anatomical inputs, and Stage~2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Central to the approach is the \textbf{Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)} loss, a physics-informed objective that integrates voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation. We evaluate the generality of the framework across multiple transformer backbones, including Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, and MedFormer, using a prostate IMRT dataset. FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR achieves the strongest performance among the evaluated models and improves over existing benchmark CNN and single-stage methods, reducing Energy Error to $\mathbf{4.5\%}$ and yielding statistically significant gains in structural fidelity ($p < 0.05$).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models lack emotional awareness, and emotion-driven models sacrifice content accuracy. The goal is to bridge this gap with faithful content and expressive emotion control.

Method: Proposes EmoCtrl, using textual and visual emotion enhancement modules, supported by an annotated dataset linking emotions to visual cues.

Result: EmoCtrl outperforms existing methods in content fidelity and emotional expression, confirmed by quantatitive, qualatitive experiments, and user studies.

Conclusion: EmoCtrl successfully combines content faithfulness and emotional expression, generalizes well to creative applications, and aligns with human preferences.

Abstract: An image conveys meaning through both its visual content and emotional tone, jointly shaping human perception. We introduce Controllable Emotional Image Content Generation (C-EICG), which aims to generate images that remain faithful to a given content description while expressing a target emotion. Existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, whereas emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. To address this gap, we propose EmoCtrl, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, bridging abstract emotions to visual cues. EmoCtrl incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. The learned emotion tokens exhibit complementary effects, as demonstrated through ablations and visualizations. Quantatitive and qualatitive experiments demonstrate that EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods across multiple aspects. User studies confirm EmoCtrl's strong alignment with human preference. Moreover, EmoCtrl generalizes well to creative applications, further demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of the learned emotion tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed LiDAR resolution and beam dropout limit perception in autonomous systems.

Method: Models LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs with gated residual fusion and feed-forward refinement.

Result: Achieves lower reconstruction error and better geometric consistency than PointNet and deeper GAT models.

Conclusion: Architectural refinement improves LiDAR resolution efficiently without extra hardware.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems is constrained by fixed vertical beam resolution and further compromised by beam dropout resulting from environmental occlusions. This paper introduces SuperiorGAT, a graph attention-based framework designed to reconstruct missing elevation information in sparse LiDAR point clouds. By modeling LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and incorporating gated residual fusion with feed-forward refinement, SuperiorGAT enables accurate reconstruction without increasing network depth. To evaluate performance, structured beam dropout is simulated by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam. Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments, including Person, Road, Campus, and City sequences, demonstrate that SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines. Qualitative X-Z projections further confirm the model's ability to preserve structural integrity with minimal vertical distortion. These results suggest that architectural refinement offers a computationally efficient method for improving LiDAR resolution without requiring additional sensor hardware.

TL;DR: A line-based calibration framework for event cameras uses geometric lines from man-made objects, avoiding manual calibration objects and achieving accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current event camera calibration methods are time-consuming and require manual setup, limiting their use in dynamic scenarios.

Method: The proposed method detects lines directly from event streams, uses an event-line calibration model for initial parameter estimation, and refines parameters with non-linear optimization.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments confirm the method's feasibility and accuracy for monocular and stereo event cameras.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient and accurate alternative to traditional event camera calibration methods, suitable for rapidly changing environments.

Abstract: Camera calibration is an essential prerequisite for event-based vision applications. Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then, a non-linear optimization is adopted to refine camera parameters. Both simulation and real-world experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras.

TL;DR: QDFNet is a novel fusion network for robust optical-SAR object detection, addressing challenges like missing modalities and degraded data through dynamic quality assessment and adaptive fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with misalignment and missing modalities in optical-SAR fusion, limiting robustness and consistency in detection performance.

Method: QDFNet uses learnable reference tokens (DMQA module) for dynamic reliability assessment and adaptive fusion, alongside OCNF module for orthogonal feature fusion.

Result: QDFNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets, especially under partial modality corruption.

Conclusion: QDFNet effectively tackles optical-SAR fusion challenges, providing robust and adaptive solutions for object detection in remote sensing.

Abstract: Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fusion-based object detection has attracted significant research interest in remote sensing, as these modalities provide complementary information for all-weather monitoring. However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.

TL;DR: SonoVision is a smartphone app using sound cues to help visually impaired individuals locate objects independently.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance independence for visually impaired individuals by reducing reliance on others and avoiding dangerous scenarios.

Method: Developed using Flutter, the app employs the Efficientdet-D2 model for offline object detection and uses sinusoidal sound cues via earphones.

Result: The app enables users to locate objects safely and independently through sound cues.

Conclusion: SonoVision offers a user-friendly, offline solution to improve independence for visually impaired individuals.

Abstract: Locating objects for the visually impaired is a significant challenge and is something no one can get used to over time. However, this hinders their independence and could push them towards risky and dangerous scenarios. Hence, in the spirit of making the visually challenged more self-sufficient, we present SonoVision, a smart-phone application that helps them find everyday objects using sound cues through earphones/headphones. This simply means, if an object is on the right or left side of a user, the app makes a sinusoidal sound in a user's respective ear through ear/headphones. However, to indicate objects located directly in front, both the left and right earphones are rung simultaneously. These sound cues could easily help a visually impaired individual locate objects with the help of their smartphones and reduce the reliance on people in their surroundings, consequently making them more independent. This application is made with the flutter development platform and uses the Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection in the backend. We believe the app will significantly assist the visually impaired in a safe and user-friendly manner with its capacity to work completely offline.

Conclusion: SAM 3D provides practical guidance for urban 3D reconstruction and motivates future integration of scene-level structural priors.

Abstract: Monocular 3D building reconstruction from remote sensing imagery is essential for scalable urban modeling, yet existing methods often require task-specific architectures and intensive supervision. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of SAM 3D, a general-purpose image-to-3D foundation model, for monocular remote sensing building reconstruction. We benchmark SAM 3D against TRELLIS on samples from the NYC Urban Dataset, employing Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) as evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM 3D produces more coherent roof geometry and sharper boundaries compared to TRELLIS. We further extend SAM 3D to urban scene reconstruction through a segment-reconstruct-compose pipeline, demonstrating its potential for urban scene modeling. We also analyze practical limitations and discuss future research directions. These findings provide practical guidance for deploying foundation models in urban 3D reconstruction and motivate future integration of scene-level structural priors.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using computer vision models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) to autonomously map substation components, addressing the inefficiency of manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electrical substations are vulnerable to hazards, and their failures can have major economic and safety impacts, necessitating efficient vulnerability assessment.

Method: The study trains and compares three computer vision models on labeled US substation images, evaluating their accuracy, precision, and efficiency.

Result: Key strengths and limitations of each model are presented, identifying the most reliable one for large-scale substation component mapping.

Conclusion: Machine learning proves effective for substation mapping, offering a scalable solution compared to traditional manual methods.

Abstract: Electrical substations are a significant component of an electrical grid. Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency. We present the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping. Additionally, we utilize these models to effectively map the various substation components in the United States, showcasing a use case for machine learning in substation mapping.

### [48] [Pose-Guided Residual Refinement for Interpretable Text-to-Motion Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22464)
*Sukhyun Jeong,Yong-Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGR$^2$M introduces a hybrid representation combining pose codes and residual codes to improve text-based 3D motion generation and editing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose-code-based frameworks struggle with capturing subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, limiting reconstruction fidelity and local controllability.

Method: PGR$^2$M uses a hybrid representation with pose codes for coarse structure and residual codes for fine details, employing residual vector quantization and a dual-Transformer architecture.

Result: PGR$^2$M improves motion generation and editing metrics on benchmarks like HumanML3D and KIT-ML, outperforming CoMo and other baselines.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enhances interpretability and editability while maintaining high fidelity, validated by both metrics and user studies.

Abstract: Text-based 3D motion generation aims to automatically synthesize diverse motions from natural-language descriptions to extend user creativity, whereas motion editing modifies an existing motion sequence in response to text while preserving its overall structure. Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using multiple event cameras achieves high-precision measurement of shock wave motion parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution, addressing challenges like fast propagation and unstable conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate measurement of shock wave motion parameters is crucial for power field testing and damage assessment, but existing methods struggle with fast propagation and unstable conditions.

Method: The framework uses multiple event cameras in a polar coordinate system to encode events and extract adaptive ROIs. Iterative slope analysis extracts shock wave front events, and a geometric model derives motion parameters.

Result: The method achieves high-precision measurements with errors ranging from 0.06% to 5.20% compared to pressure sensors and empirical formulas.

Conclusion: This approach significantly advances shock wave measurement by combining high spatial and temporal resolution, demonstrating robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of shock wave motion parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution is essential for applications such as power field testing and damage assessment. However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-precision measurement of the shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage semi-supervised paradigm using a Hierarchical MoE Adapter addresses annotation costs in infrared small object detection, outperforming fully supervised methods with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small object detection suffers from high annotation costs and existing methods like SAM struggle with domain gaps, lack of physical priors, and complexity.

Method: Proposes a two-stage approach: Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation (using MoE Adapter and 10% data) and Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer (pseudo-labeling for lightweight models).

Result: Downstream models achieve performance comparable to or better than fully supervised counterparts with minimal annotations.

Conclusion: The paradigm successfully tackles data scarcity in IR-SOT using SAM as a teacher model, offering efficiency and performance gains.

Abstract: Infrared small object detection urgently requires semi-supervised paradigms due to the high cost of annotation. However, existing methods like SAM face significant challenges of domain gaps, inability of encoding physical priors, and inherent architectural complexity. To address this, we designed a Hierarchical MoE Adapter consisting of four white-box neural operators. Building upon this core component, we propose a two-stage paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation, where we use our MoE adapter and 10% of available fully supervised data to distill SAM into an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM); and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer, where we use Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight and efficient downstream models. Experiments demonstrate that with minimal annotations, our paradigm enables downstream models to achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, their fully supervised counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised paradigm that systematically addresses the data scarcity issue in IR-SOT using SAM as the teacher model.

TL;DR: Video-GMAE is a self-supervised method using Gaussian splats for video representation, achieving strong tracking performance and surpassing other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve video representation learning by leveraging the inductive bias that 2-D videos are projections of 3-D scenes.

Method: It encodes video frames as moving Gaussian splats, enabling emergent tracking during pretraining.

Result: Achieves zero-shot tracking comparable to SOTA and improves Kinetics by 34.6% and Kubric by 13.1% with finetuning.

Conclusion: Video-GMAE advances self-supervised video learning and offers competitive performance.

Abstract: We propose Video Gaussian Masked Autoencoders (Video-GMAE), a self-supervised approach for representation learning that encodes a sequence of images into a set of Gaussian splats moving over time. Representing a video as a set of Gaussians enforces a reasonable inductive bias: that 2-D videos are often consistent projections of a dynamic 3-D scene. We find that tracking emerges when pretraining a network with this architecture. Mapping the trajectory of the learnt Gaussians onto the image plane gives zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art. With small-scale finetuning, our models achieve 34.6% improvement on Kinetics, and 13.1% on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

TL;DR: SCAFusion improves small, irregular object detection for lunar missions with minimal resource increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in lunar environments due to poor feature alignment and weak small object detection.

Method: Integrates Cognitive Adapter, Contrastive Alignment Module, Camera Auxiliary Training Branch, and Section-aware Coordinate Attention.

Result: Achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on nuScenes, improving baseline by 5.0% and 2.7%. In lunar simulation, 90.93% mAP, outperforming baseline by 11.5%.

Conclusion: SCAFusion enhances detection performance for lunar missions with efficient tuning and alignment.

Abstract: Reliable and precise detection of small and irregular objects, such as meteor fragments and rocks, is critical for autonomous navigation and operation in lunar surface exploration. Existing multimodal 3D perception methods designed for terrestrial autonomous driving often underperform in off world environments due to poor feature alignment, limited multimodal synergy, and weak small object detection. This paper presents SCAFusion, a multimodal 3D object detection model tailored for lunar robotic missions. Built upon the BEVFusion framework, SCAFusion integrates a Cognitive Adapter for efficient camera backbone tuning, a Contrastive Alignment Module to enhance camera LiDAR feature consistency, a Camera Auxiliary Training Branch to strengthen visual representation, and most importantly, a Section aware Coordinate Attention mechanism explicitly designed to boost the detection performance of small, irregular targets. With negligible increase in parameters and computation, our model achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on the nuScenes validation set, improving the baseline by 5.0% and 2.7%, respectively. In simulated lunar environments built on Isaac Sim, SCAFusion achieves 90.93% mAP, outperforming the baseline by 11.5%, with notable gains in detecting small meteor like obstacles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamOmni3 introduces scribble-based editing and generation tasks, improving flexibility over text-only prompts by combining text, images, and sketches. It addresses data creation and framework challenges, using a novel joint input scheme for precise localization and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language often fails to capture fine-grained visual details or intended edit locations. To overcome this, scribble-based tasks are proposed for more flexible creation via GUI.

Method: DreamOmni3 uses a data synthesis pipeline for scribble-based editing and generation tasks. It introduces a joint input scheme with color-coded regions and shared encodings for precise localization.

Result: DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance, with models and code to be publicly released.

Conclusion: DreamOmni3 successfully enhances editing and generation flexibility by integrating scribbles, images, and text, setting benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Recently unified generation and editing models have achieved remarkable success with their impressive performance. These models rely mainly on text prompts for instruction-based editing and generation, but language often fails to capture users intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. To this end, we propose two tasks: scribble-based editing and generation, that enables more flexible creation on graphical user interface (GUI) combining user textual, images, and freehand sketches. We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing. Finally, we establish comprehensive benchmarks for these tasks to promote further research. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance, and models and code will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoAgent addresses coherence and consistency in video generation via a collaborative plan-synthesize-verify pipeline, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models struggle with identity drift and scene inconsistency due to independent shot treatment.

Method: CoAgent uses a storyboard planner, global context manager, synthesis module, verifier agent, and pacing-aware editor for coherent video generation.

Result: CoAgent significantly enhances coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long videos.

Conclusion: CoAgent's closed-loop framework effectively tackles challenges in open-domain video generation.

Abstract: Maintaining narrative coherence and visual consistency remains a central challenge in open-domain video generation. Existing text-to-video models often treat each shot independently, resulting in identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure. We propose CoAgent, a collaborative and closed-loop framework for coherent video generation that formulates the process as a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline. Given a user prompt, style reference, and pacing constraints, a Storyboard Planner decomposes the input into structured shot-level plans with explicit entities, spatial relations, and temporal cues. A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots. Each shot is then generated by a Synthesis Module under the guidance of a Visual Consistency Controller, while a Verifier Agent evaluates intermediate results using vision-language reasoning and triggers selective regeneration when inconsistencies are detected. Finally, a pacing-aware editor refines temporal rhythm and transitions to match the desired narrative flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoAgent significantly improves coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation.

TL;DR: SR-MCR is a lightweight, label-free framework aligning multimodal LLMs' reasoning by using intrinsic process signals, improving accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment approaches neglect intermediate reasoning reliability, leading to weak coherence and visual grounding.

Method: SR-MCR integrates five self-referential cues into a reliability-weighted reward and uses a critic-free GRPO objective with cooling.

Result: SR-MCR-7B achieves 81.4% accuracy, outperforming comparable open-source models.

Conclusion: SR-MCR enhances reasoning reliability and accuracy, with each component contributing significantly.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs often produce fluent yet unreliable reasoning, exhibiting weak step-to-step coherence and insufficient visual grounding, largely because existing alignment approaches supervise only the final answer while ignoring the reliability of the intermediate reasoning process. We introduce SR-MCR, a lightweight and label-free framework that aligns reasoning by exploiting intrinsic process signals derived directly from model outputs. Five self-referential cues -- semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, and step consistency -- are integrated into a normalized, reliability-weighted reward that provides fine-grained process-level guidance. A critic-free GRPO objective, enhanced with a confidence-aware cooling mechanism, further stabilizes training and suppresses trivial or overly confident generations. Built on Qwen2.5-VL, SR-MCR improves both answer accuracy and reasoning coherence across a broad set of visual benchmarks; among open-source models of comparable size, SR-MCR-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 81.4%. Ablation studies confirm the independent contributions of each reward term and the cooling module.

Result: Achieved high Dice Similarity Coefficients: up to 94.09% WT, 92.91% ET, and 93.84% TC across BraTS2019-2021 datasets.

Conclusion: The techniques significantly improve glioma segmentation and classification, addressing key diagnostic challenges.

Abstract: Gliomas are among the most aggressive cancers, characterized by high mortality rates and complex diagnostic processes. Existing studies on glioma diagnosis and classification often describe issues such as high variability in imaging data, inadequate optimization of computational resources, and inefficient segmentation and classification of gliomas. To address these challenges, we propose novel techniques utilizing multi-parametric MRI data to enhance tumor segmentation and classification efficiency. Our work introduces the first-ever radiomics-enhanced fused residual multiparametric 3D network (ReFRM3D) for brain tumor characterization, which is based on a 3D U-Net architecture and features multi-scale feature fusion, hybrid upsampling, and an extended residual skip mechanism. Additionally, we propose a multi-feature tumor marker-based classifier that leverages radiomic features extracted from the segmented regions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance across the BraTS2019, BraTS2020, and BraTS2021 datasets, achieving high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 94.04%, 92.68%, and 93.64% for whole tumor (WT), enhancing tumor (ET), and tumor core (TC) respectively in BraTS2019; 94.09%, 92.91%, and 93.84% in BraTS2020; and 93.70%, 90.36%, and 92.13% in BraTS2021.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KV-Tracker, a method enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction using multi-view 3D geometry networks by caching key-value pairs for speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D geometry networks are slow for real-time applications, prompting the need for an efficient adaptation.

Method: The method selects keyframes and caches KV pairs from global self-attention blocks to represent scenes, enabling fast inference without retraining.

Result: KV-Tracker achieves up to 15x speedup and maintains high frame-rates (~27 FPS) on datasets like TUM RGB-D and 7-Scenes.

Conclusion: KV-Tracker effectively adapts multi-view networks for real-time applications without sacrificing performance or requiring retraining.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D geometry networks offer a powerful prior but are prohibitively slow for real-time applications. We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PTalker, a framework for personalized 3D talking head animation that enhances realism by capturing individual speaking styles and improving lip-sync accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack personalization and overlook speaking style nuances, limiting realism in speech-driven 3D talking head generation.

Method: PTalker disentangles style and content from audio and motion, using a three-level alignment mechanism (spatial, temporal, feature) for lip-sync accuracy.

Result: PTalker outperforms state-of-the-art methods, generating realistic, stylized animations that match individual speaking styles.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap in personalization and lip-sync accuracy, offering a significant advancement in 3D talking head generation.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D talking head generation aims to produce lifelike facial animations precisely synchronized with speech. While considerable progress has been made in achieving high lip-synchronization accuracy, existing methods largely overlook the intricate nuances of individual speaking styles, which limits personalization and realism. In this work, we present a novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation, namely "PTalker". This framework preserves speaking style through style disentanglement from audio and facial motion sequences and enhances lip-synchronization accuracy through a three-level alignment mechanism between audio and mesh modalities. Specifically, to effectively disentangle style and content, we design disentanglement constraints that encode driven audio and motion sequences into distinct style and content spaces to enhance speaking style representation. To improve lip-synchronization accuracy, we adopt a modality alignment mechanism incorporating three aspects: spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks to capture vertex connectivity in the 3D mesh structure, temporal alignment using cross-attention to capture and synchronize temporal dependencies, and feature alignment by top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints to ensure consistency between speech and mesh modalities. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that PTalker effectively generates realistic, stylized 3D talking heads that accurately match identity-specific speaking styles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The source code and supplementary videos are available at: PTalker.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT) to improve face clustering by enhancing the reliability of similarity measurements through a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Jaccard similarity methods for face clustering introduce irrelevant nodes and lack discriminative power, leading to suboptimal clustering results.

Method: Proposes a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient and a Transformer-based model (SDT) to refine similarity estimation by reducing noise and focusing on relevant node relationships.

Result: SDT achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets like MS-Celeb-1M, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The SDT framework enhances face clustering by improving similarity measurement reliability, offering a robust solution.

Abstract: The method used to measure relationships between face embeddings plays a crucial role in determining the performance of face clustering. Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, such as MS-Celeb-1M, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming existing methods and providing a more robust solution for face clustering.

Motivation: Autoregressive VLMs limit efficacy in complex visual planning and robotic control. Diffusion-based models offer a superior alternative.

Method: Dream-VL is built on diffusion-based LLMs, and Dream-VLA extends this with continuous pre-training on robotic datasets.

Result: Dream-VL matches top-tier AR-VLMs on benchmarks, while Dream-VLA excels in robotic tasks (97.2% success on LIBERO).

Conclusion: Diffusion-based VLMs and VLAs outperform autoregressive models, offering faster convergence and superior performance.

Abstract: While autoregressive Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their sequential generation often limits their efficacy in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic control. In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper systematically studies memory mechanisms in SAM-based visual object tracking, proposing a unified hybrid memory framework for improved robustness under challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve memory design principles in SAM-based tracking, especially with next-generation models like SAM3.

Method: Analyzes SAM2-based trackers, reimplements memory mechanisms in SAM3, and proposes a hybrid memory framework combining short-term and long-term memory.

Result: The framework enhances robustness in occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios across SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Conclusion: A unified memory approach significantly improves tracking performance, with potential for further refinement in future revisions.

Abstract: \noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory.

*Yuming Gu,Yizhi Wang,Yining Hong,Yipeng Gao,Hao Jiang,Angtian Wang,Bo Liu,Nathaniel S. Dennler,Zhengfei Kuang,Hao Li,Gordon Wetzstein,Chongyang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Envision is a diffusion-based framework for embodied visual planning that ensures goal alignment and physical plausibility by explicitly constraining trajectory generation with a goal image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual planning methods often suffer from spatial drift and misalignment due to lack of explicit goal modeling.

Method: Envision uses a two-stage approach: a Goal Imagery Model synthesizes coherent goal images, and an Env-Goal Video Model interpolates between initial and goal states to produce smooth trajectories.

Result: Experiments show Envision outperforms baselines in goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation.

Conclusion: Envision provides reliable visual plans for robotic tasks, improving downstream planning and control.

Abstract: Embodied visual planning aims to enable manipulation tasks by imagining how a scene evolves toward a desired goal and using the imagined trajectories to guide actions. Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines. The resulting visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control, providing reliable guidance for embodied agents.

*Yidi Liu,Zihao Fan,Jie Huang,Jie Xiao,Dong Li,Wenlong Zhang,Lei Bai,Xueyang Fu,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FinPercep-RM and CCL to address reward hacking in RLHF for ISR tasks, improving both global and local perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IQA models in RLHF for ISR tasks are insensitive to local distortions, leading to reward hacking and misalignment with perceptual quality.

Method: Proposes Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) with a Perceptual Degradation Map and Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) for stable training.

Result: Experiments show improved global quality and local realism in ISR models using RLHF.

Conclusion: FinPercep-RM and CCL effectively mitigate reward hacking and enhance perceptual quality in ISR tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in image generation field guided by reward models to align human preferences. Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.

*Shravan Saranyan,Pramit Saha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models, particularly modified 3D Inception, outperform manual methods for estimating LVEF from echocardiography, achieving an RMSE of 6.79%. Architectural choices and hyperparameters significantly impact performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual LVEF assessment is time-consuming and variable. Deep learning can automate and improve accuracy.

Method: Evaluated 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models on EchoNet-Dynamic (10,030 videos), focusing on architecture and hyperparameters.

Result: 3D Inception performed best (RMSE: 6.79%). Smaller models generalized better. Hyperparameters like kernel size were critical.

Conclusion: Deep learning is effective for LVEF estimation. Findings may extend to other video analysis tasks.

Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies. While this study focuses on echocardiography-based LVEF estimation, the insights gained regarding architectural design and training strategies may be applicable to a broader range of medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with semantic alignment to complex prompts. CritiFusion aims to improve consistency and detail.

Method: Uses CritiCore for semantic feedback and SpecFusion for spectral-domain refinement, integrating with existing diffusion models.

Result: Enhances text-to-image correspondence and visual quality, matching state-of-the-art performance in human preference scores.

Conclusion: CritiFusion effectively improves semantic alignment and detail in generated images through critique and spectral refinement.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity but often struggle with semantic alignment to complex prompts. We introduce CritiFusion, a novel inference-time framework that integrates a multimodal semantic critique mechanism with frequency-domain refinement to improve text-to-image consistency and detail. The proposed CritiCore module leverages a vision-language model and multiple large language models to enrich the prompt context and produce high-level semantic feedback, guiding the diffusion process to better align generated content with the prompt's intent. Additionally, SpecFusion merges intermediate generation states in the spectral domain, injecting coarse structural information while preserving high-frequency details. No additional model training is required. CritiFusion serves as a plug-in refinement stage compatible with existing diffusion backbones. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our method notably improves human-aligned metrics of text-to-image correspondence and visual quality. CritiFusion consistently boosts performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches. Qualitative results further demonstrate superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity, indicating the effectiveness of our semantic critique and spectral alignment strategy.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing models in accurately predicting complex motions despite advancements in video generation scaling.

Method: The authors propose autoregressive flow matching (ARFM), trained on diverse video datasets, to model sequential continuous data and predict future point track locations.

Result: ARFM successfully predicts complex motions and improves downstream task performance in robot action and human motion prediction when conditioned on predicted future tracks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that ARFM effectively models and predicts complex motions, highlighting its potential for enhancing motion prediction tasks in robotics and human motion analysis.

Abstract: Motion prediction has been studied in different contexts with models trained on narrow distributions and applied to downstream tasks in human motion prediction and robotics. Simultaneously, recent efforts in scaling video prediction have demonstrated impressive visual realism, yet they struggle to accurately model complex motions despite massive scale. Inspired by the scaling of video generation, we develop autoregressive flow matching (ARFM), a new method for probabilistic modeling of sequential continuous data and train it on diverse video datasets to generate future point track locations over long horizons. To evaluate our model, we develop benchmarks for evaluating the ability of motion prediction models to predict human and robot motion.

### [70] [Multimodal Diffeomorphic Registration with Neural ODEs and Structural Descriptors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22689)
*Salvador Rodriguez-Sanz,Monica Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal diffeomorphic registration method using Neural ODEs, addressing challenges like accuracy-complexity tradeoffs and modality limitations. It outperforms existing methods in various experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current nonrigid registration methods face accuracy-complexity tradeoffs and are limited to monomodal settings due to intensity correlation assumptions. Learning-based models require extensive training data and perform poorly on unseen modalities.

Method: The proposed method uses Neural ODEs with structural descriptors, integrating image-based or feature-based descriptors and local mutual information similarities. Three variants are tested.

Result: The method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in multimodal registration, handles large or small deformations, and shows robustness to varying regularization levels and scales while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses multimodal registration challenges, offering superior performance, robustness, and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This work proposes a multimodal diffeomorphic registration method using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Nonrigid registration algorithms exhibit tradeoffs between their accuracy, the computational complexity of their deformation model, and its proper regularization. In addition, they also assume intensity correlation in anatomically homologous regions of interest among image pairs, limiting their applicability to the monomodal setting. Unlike learning-based models, we propose an instance-specific framework that is not subject to high scan requirements for training and does not suffer performance degradation at inference time on modalities unseen during training. Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries. We propose three different variants that integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information. We conduct extensive evaluations on different experiments formed by scan dataset combinations and show surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines adequate for large or small deformations, and specific of multimodal registration. Lastly, we also demonstrate the underlying robustness of the proposed framework to varying levels of explicit regularization while maintaining low error, its suitability for registration at varying scales, and its efficiency with respect to other methods targeted to large-deformation registration.

TL;DR: SCPainter integrates 3D Gaussian Splat car assets and scene point clouds with diffusion models to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis for diverse autonomous driving training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the diversity and realism of training data for autonomous driving models by addressing the limitations of isolated 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis methods.

Method: Combines 3D Gaussian Splat car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to project and condition high-quality images for novel views.

Result: Demonstrated capability on the Waymo Open Dataset to create diverse and realistic driving scenarios through unified 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: SCPainter successfully integrates realistic 3D asset insertion with novel view synthesis, improving the robustness and safety of autonomous driving models.

Abstract: 3D Asset insertion and novel view synthesis (NVS) are key components for autonomous driving simulation, enhancing the diversity of training data. With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images. Evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the capability of our framework to enable 3D asset insertion and NVS, facilitating the creation of diverse and realistic driving data.

TL;DR: The study explores ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining (USF-MAE) for detecting cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images, outperforming a DenseNet-169 baseline with higher accuracy and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of cystic hygroma can improve reproducibility and scalability in early screening, but supervised methods face limitations due to small labelled datasets.

Method: The USF-MAE model, pretrained on 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, was fine-tuned for binary classification (cystic hygroma vs. normal). Performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC-AUC, and Score-CAM visualizations.

Result: USF-MAE outperformed DenseNet-169, achieving higher accuracy (0.96), sensitivity (0.94), specificity (0.98), and ROC-AUC (0.98). Score-CAM visualizations confirmed clinical relevance, and statistical tests showed significant improvements (p = 0.0057).

Conclusion: USF-MAE demonstrates superior performance for cystic hygroma detection, offering a promising approach for scalable and accurate prenatal screening.

Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Freetime FeatureGS for decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos, eliminating reliance on unstable video segmentation by using learnable Gaussian primitives and a streaming feature learning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods depend on unstable video segmentation maps for 4D reconstruction, leading to unreliable results. The goal is to bypass this dependency and achieve accurate 4D segmentation directly from per-image segmentation maps.

Method: Freetime FeatureGS represents dynamic scenes with Gaussian primitives featuring learnable attributes and linear motion. A contrastive loss ensures feature consistency based on 2D segmentation maps, while a streaming feature learning strategy propagates features temporally.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior reconstruction quality compared to recent methods, showcasing significant improvements.

Conclusion: Freetime FeatureGS effectively bypasses unstable video segmentation, achieving accurate and reliable 4D scene reconstruction through innovative Gaussian primitives and temporal feature propagation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos. Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Bo Huang,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes visual token pruning challenges in long-context, multi-image settings and introduces an adaptive pruning method to reduce redundancy while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token pruning methods overlook long-context inputs with multiple images, leading to increased inference costs.

Method: The proposed method decomposes redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components, using diversity and variation metrics for dynamic token allocation. It involves two stages: intra-image token selection and inter-image global filtering.

Result: Experiments show the method maintains performance in long-context settings while significantly reducing visual tokens.

Conclusion: The adaptive pruning method effectively addresses the challenges of visual token pruning in multi-image, long-context scenarios.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have proven effective on various tasks. They typically encode visual inputs into Original Model sequences of tokens, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by the language model. However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly cutting down the number of visual tokens.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in visual recognition tasks, but redundant token representations limit their computational efficiency. Existing token merging and pruning strategies often overlook spatial continuity and neighbor relationships, resulting in the loss of local context. This paper proposes novel neighbor-aware token reduction methods based on Hilbert curve reordering, which explicitly preserves the neighbor structure in a 2D space using 1D sequential representations. Our method introduces two key strategies: Neighbor-Aware Pruning (NAP) for selective token retention and Merging by Adjacent Token similarity (MAT) for local token aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing methods. This work highlights the importance of spatial continuity and neighbor structure, offering new insights for the architectural optimization of ViTs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an active learning algorithm using Fisher Information to select informative frames for model training, improving rendering quality and semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents need efficient understanding of semantics and dynamics, which involves data redundancy. The goal is to prioritize frames offering maximum information gain.

Method: Proposes an active learning algorithm leveraging Fisher Information to quantify informativeness of views for semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks.

Result: The method improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation, outperforming random selection and uncertainty-based heuristics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a principled alternative to heuristic or random strategies, effectively handling semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling.

Abstract: Understanding semantics and dynamics has been crucial for embodied agents in various tasks. Both tasks have much more data redundancy than the static scene understanding task. We formulate the view selection problem as an active learning problem, where the goal is to prioritize frames that provide the greatest information gain for model training. To this end, we propose an active learning algorithm with Fisher Information that quantifies the informativeness of candidate views with respect to both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks. This formulation allows our method to jointly handle semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling, providing a principled alternative to heuristic or random strategies. We evaluate our method on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets by selecting informative frames from multi-camera setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance, outperforming baseline methods based on random selection and uncertainty-based heuristics.

*Zhicheng Liao,Baoliang Chen,Hanwei Zhu,Lingyu Zhu,Shiqi Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'semantic drift' in AGIQA models and proposes an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) called Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) to address it, enhancing performance across AGIQA frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AGIQA models suffer from 'semantic drift,' where image embeddings inconsistently match quality descriptions, undermining reliability.

Method: The proposed AGQG module uses a two-branch approach: one estimates image ability, the other constructs difficulty levels arithmetically for unimodal quality distribution.

Result: AGQG improves performance when integrated into AGIQA frameworks and generalizes well to natural and screen content image quality assessment.

Conclusion: AGQG effectively mitigates semantic drift and shows promise as a universal component for future IQA models.

Abstract: Existing AGIQA models typically estimate image quality by measuring and aggregating the similarities between image embeddings and text embeddings derived from multi-grade quality descriptions. Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both "excellent" and "poor" grade descriptions while deviating from the "good" one. We refer to this phenomenon as "semantic drift", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPD-Solver accelerates diffusion models by using parallel gradient evaluations to reduce truncation errors, maintaining low latency with a two-stage optimization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from high sampling latency and quality degradation under low-latency budgets due to truncation errors. The paper aims to mitigate these issues.

Method: Proposes EPD-Solver, an ODE solver with parallel gradient evaluations, a distillation-based optimization stage, and RL fine-tuning in a low-dimensional solver space.

Result: EPD-Solver improves sampling accuracy and maintains low latency, with flexibility to enhance existing ODE samplers as a plugin.

Conclusion: EPD-Solver effectively addresses latency and quality issues in diffusion models, offering a versatile and efficient solution.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature. Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. In addition, our method is flexible and can serve as a plugin (EPD-Plugin) to improve existing ODE samplers.

TL;DR: VPTracker introduces a global tracking framework using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance robustness against viewpoint changes and occlusions, with a location-aware visual prompting mechanism to minimize distractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language tracking methods suffer from local search limitations, leading to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid movements.

Method: The proposed VPTracker employs MLLMs for global tracking and integrates a location-aware visual prompting mechanism using spatial priors to prioritize region-level recognition.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate improved tracking stability and better target disambiguation in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: VPTracker successfully combines MLLMs with visual tracking, offering a robust solution and potential for future integrations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Tracking aims to continuously localize objects described by a visual template and a language description. Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of medical images is a key technology in medical image analysis and clinical diagnosis, providing structural visualization support for disease assessment and surgical planning. Traditional methods are computationally expensive and prone to structural discontinuities and loss of detail in sparse slices, making it difficult to meet clinical accuracy requirements.To address these challenges, we propose an efficient 3D reconstruction method based on 3D Gaussian and tri-plane representations. This method not only maintains the advantages of Gaussian representation in efficient rendering and geometric representation but also significantly enhances structural continuity and semantic consistency under sparse slicing conditions. Experimental results on multimodal medical datasets such as US and MRI show that our proposed method can generate high-quality, anatomically coherent, and semantically stable medical images under sparse data conditions, while significantly improving reconstruction efficiency. This provides an efficient and reliable new approach for 3D visualization and clinical analysis of medical images.

Motivation: To assess how well open-vocabulary object detection models perform under low-quality image conditions, aiming for human-like recognition capabilities.

Method: Introduces a new dataset simulating real-world low-quality images and evaluates models like OWLv2, OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic under varying degradation levels.

Result: Models showed no significant mAP drop under low-level degradation but declined sharply under high-level degradation. OWLv2 performed best consistently.

Conclusion: OWLv2 is more robust to image degradation. The dataset and codes will be released to support further research.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection enables models to localize and recognize objects beyond a predefined set of categories and is expected to achieve recognition capabilities comparable to human performance. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of existing models on open-vocabulary object detection tasks under low-quality image conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a new dataset that simulates low-quality images in the real world. In our evaluation experiment, we find that although open-vocabulary object detection models exhibited no significant decrease in mAP scores under low-level image degradation, the performance of all models dropped sharply under high-level image degradation. OWLv2 models consistently performed better across different types of degradation, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoReAct, an autoregressive framework for generating 3D-aligned human reactions from egocentric video streams in real-time, addressing challenges like causality and spatial alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack spatial consistency between egocentric video and reaction motion. The paper aims to solve this by creating HRD and EgoReAct.

Method: HRD is constructed for better data alignment. EgoReAct uses VQ-VAE for motion compression and GPT for reaction generation, incorporating 3D dynamic features.

Result: EgoReAct outperforms prior methods in realism, spatial consistency, and efficiency while maintaining strict causality.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenges of causal generation and 3D alignment, promising real-time applications.

Abstract: Humans exhibit adaptive, context-sensitive responses to egocentric visual input. However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance.

TL;DR: DA360 enhances panoramic depth estimation by adapting Depth Anything V2 for $360^	extdegree$ scenes, improving zero-shot generalization and reducing depth errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in zero-shot generalization of panoramic depth estimation compared to perspective images, aiming to transfer capabilities from the perspective domain to panoramic settings.

Method: DA360 learns a shift parameter from ViT backbone for scale-invariant estimates and integrates circular padding in the DPT decoder to ensure seamless depth maps.

Result: DA360 reduces relative depth errors by over 50% indoors and 10% outdoors, outperforming existing methods like PanDA by 30% in error reduction.

Conclusion: DA360 sets new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Panoramic depth estimation provides a comprehensive solution for capturing complete $360^\circ$ environmental structural information, offering significant benefits for robotics and AR/VR applications. However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\% and 10\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, DA360 significantly outperforms robust panoramic depth estimation methods, achieving about 30\% relative error improvement compared to PanDA across all three test datasets and establishing new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KANO, a novel interpretable operator for single-image Super-resolution (SR), using B-spline functions to model degradation transparently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SR methods rely on opaque black-box networks, leaving degradation processes unknown and uncontrollable. KANO aims to provide transparency.

Method: KANO uses B-spline functions in an additive structure to approximate spectral curves, optimizing shape parameters for accurate degradation modeling.

Result: KANO captures spectral characteristics like linear trends and nonlinear inflection points, enhancing SR interpretability across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: KANO offers a structured, interpretable approach to SR, with insights from comparisons between MLPs and KANs for degradation modeling.

Abstract: The highly nonlinear degradation process, complex physical interactions, and various sources of uncertainty render single-image Super-resolution (SR) a particularly challenging task. Existing interpretable SR approaches, whether based on prior learning or deep unfolding optimization frameworks, typically rely on black-box deep networks to model latent variables, which leaves the degradation process largely unknown and uncontrollable. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT), we for the first time propose a novel interpretable operator, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), with the application to image SR. KANO provides a transparent and structured representation of the latent degradation fitting process. Specifically, we employ an additive structure composed of a finite number of B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves in a piecewise fashion. By learning and optimizing the shape parameters of these spline functions within defined intervals, our KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics, such as local linear trends and the peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points, thereby endowing SR results with physical interpretability. Furthermore, through theoretical modeling and experimental evaluations across natural images, aerial photographs, and satellite remote sensing data, we systematically compare multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in handling complex sequence fitting tasks. This comparative study elucidates the respective advantages and limitations of these models in characterizing intricate degradation mechanisms, offering valuable insights for the development of interpretable SR techniques.

Motivation: Existing 3D change detection methods suffer from spatial inconsistency and lack explicit separation of pre- and post-change states.

Method: Proposes SCaR-3D, using signed-distance-based 2D differencing and multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, plus continual scene reconstruction.

Result: Achieves high accuracy and efficiency, validated by experiments on the CCS3D dataset.

Conclusion: SCaR-3D effectively addresses limitations of current methods and demonstrates superior performance.

Abstract: Change detection plays a vital role in scene monitoring, exploration, and continual reconstruction. Existing 3D change detection methods often exhibit spatial inconsistency in the detected changes and fail to explicitly separate pre- and post-change states. To address these limitations, we propose SCaR-3D, a novel 3D scene change detection framework that identifies object-level changes from a dense-view pre-change image sequence and sparse-view post-change images. Our approach consists of a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging the consistent nature of 3DGS to robustly separate pre- and post-change states. We further develop a continual scene reconstruction strategy that selectively updates dynamic regions while preserving the unchanged areas. We also contribute CCS3D, a challenging synthetic dataset that allows flexible combinations of 3D change types to support controlled evaluations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves both high accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for accurate relative pose and focal length estimation in applications like self-driving cars and drones, leveraging IMU data for vertical direction.

Method: Establish constraint equations from affine correspondences, derive four equations involving focal length and rotation angle, solve using polynomial eigenvalue method.

Result: The solver outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed solver efficiently estimates pose and focal length with improved accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to estimate the relative pose and focal length between two views with known intrinsic parameters except for an unknown focal length from two affine correspondences (ACs). Cameras are commonly used in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs) in applications such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in HOI video generation, such as lack of multi-view consistency and heavy reliance on fine-grained annotations.

Method: Proposes ByteLoom with RCM-cache for geometry consistency and a progressive training curriculum to leverage existing datasets.

Result: Achieves faithful preservation of human identity and object geometry with smooth motion.

Conclusion: ByteLoom effectively improves HOI video generation by addressing key challenges.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) video generation has garnered increasing attention due to its promising applications in digital humans, e-commerce, advertising, and robotics imitation learning. However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.

TL;DR: MUSON is a multimodal dataset for social navigation with structured reasoning annotations, addressing gaps in existing datasets by providing balanced action spaces and explicit supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing social navigation datasets lack explicit reasoning supervision and have imbalanced action distributions, limiting safety-critical behavior learning.

Method: MUSON introduces a five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation (perception, prediction, reasoning, action, explanation) and models static constraints.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy (0.8625) on MUSON, proving its effectiveness as a benchmark.

Conclusion: MUSON is a reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation, filling gaps in reasoning supervision and action distribution.

Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires structured reasoning over dynamic pedestrians and physical constraints to ensure safe and interpretable decisions. However, existing social navigation datasets often lack explicit reasoning supervision and exhibit highly long-tailed action distributions, limiting models' ability to learn safety-critical behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce MUSON, a multimodal dataset for short-horizon social navigation collected across diverse indoor and outdoor campus scenes. MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space. Compared to SNEI, MUSON provides consistent reasoning, action, and explanation. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art Small Vision Language Models on MUSON shows that Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy of 0.8625, demonstrating that MUSON serves as an effective and reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lamps, a self-supervised learning method designed to capture anatomical features in medical imaging by leveraging consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods often ignore the foundational anatomical structures in medical images, limiting their effectiveness in learning meaningful features.

Method: Lamps pre-trains on large-scale chest radiographs using anatomical consistency, coherence, and hierarchy as supervision signals.

Result: Experiments on 10 datasets show Lamps outperforms 10 baseline models in robustness, transferability, and clinical potential.

Conclusion: Lamps demonstrates the potential of foundation models to learn anatomically aligned representations, enhancing medical imaging analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models have been successful in natural language processing and computer vision because they are capable of capturing the underlying structures (foundation) of natural languages. However, in medical imaging, the key foundation lies in human anatomy, as these images directly represent the internal structures of the body, reflecting the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often overlook these perspectives, limiting their ability to effectively learn anatomical features. To overcome the limitation, we built Lamps (learning anatomy from multiple perspectives via self-supervision) pre-trained on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments across 10 datasets evaluated through fine-tuning and emergent property analysis demonstrate Lamps' superior robustness, transferability, and clinical potential when compared to 10 baseline models. By learning from multiple perspectives, Lamps presents a unique opportunity for foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations that are aligned with the structure of human anatomy.

*Weiwei Li,Junzhuo Liu,Yuanyuan Ren,Yuchen Zheng,Yahao Liu,Wen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-driven pipeline to identify and mitigate spurious correlations in deep learning models, improving accuracy by over 20% compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on manual annotations or assumptions about spurious features, which may not capture real-world complexities.

Method: The approach identifies spurious features via feature space dispersion, neutralizes them through grouping, and learns a transformation to eliminate bias.

Result: Tests on image and NLP benchmarks show a 20%+ improvement in worst-group accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively reduces spurious correlations, enhancing model robustness.

Abstract: Deep learning models are known to often learn features that spuriously correlate with the class label during training but are irrelevant to the prediction task. Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation. Experiments on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks show an improvement in worst group accuracy of more than 20% compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in current concept erasure methods that focus only on text prompts, ignoring other input modalities that can reintroduce harmful or copyrighted content.

Method: Introduces M-ErasureBench for multimodal evaluation and proposes IRECE, a plug-and-play module that localizes and perturbs target concepts during denoising.

Result: Existing methods fail against embeddings and latents (CRR >90%). IRECE reduces CRR by up to 40% in challenging scenarios without sacrificing quality.

Conclusion: M-ErasureBench and IRECE provide comprehensive benchmarks and practical solutions for robust concept erasure in generative models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models may generate harmful or copyrighted content, motivating research on concept erasure. However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models.

Conclusion: Path stability is crucial for iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust solution.

Abstract: Iterative refinement methods based on a denoising-inversion cycle are powerful tools for enhancing the quality and control of diffusion models. However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process. Extensive experiments on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT show that GPS outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and complex prompt adherence. For instance, GPS achieves a superior ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, while improving overall semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%. Our work establishes that path stability is a prerequisite for effective iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust framework to achieve it.

*Yangzhi Ma,Bojun Liu,Jie Li,Li Li,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hash grid feature pruning method to reduce redundant storage by identifying and pruning invalid features, improving rate-distortion performance with an 8% average bitrate reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hash grids have redundant storage due to irregular Gaussian splat distribution, leading to invalid features and inefficiency.

Method: Prunes invalid hash grid features based on Gaussian splat coordinates, encoding only valid features.

Result: Achieves 8% average bitrate reduction without compromising performance.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces storage overhead while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Hash grids are widely used to learn an implicit neural field for Gaussian splatting, serving either as part of the entropy model or for inter-frame prediction. However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance. Following the Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by the standardization committee, our method achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline approach.

Result: Outperforms existing MLLMs, especially in complex, synchronized tasks, validated by benchmarks.

Conclusion: JavisGPT advances multimodal comprehension and generation, supported by high-quality datasets and scalable training.

Abstract: This paper presents JavisGPT, the first unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) for Joint Audio-Video (JAV) comprehension and generation. JavisGPT adopts a concise encoder-LLM-decoder architecture, featuring a SyncFusion module for spatio-temporal audio-video fusion and synchrony-aware learnable queries to bridge a pretrained JAV-DiT generator. This design enables temporally coherent video-audio understanding and generation from multimodal instructions. We design an effective three-stage training pipeline consisting of multimodal pretraining, audio-video fine-tuning, and large-scale instruction-tuning, to progressively build multimodal comprehension and generation from existing vision-language models. To support this, we further construct JavisInst-Omni, a high-quality instruction dataset with over 200K GPT-4o-curated audio-video-text dialogues that span diverse and multi-level comprehension and generation scenarios. Extensive experiments on JAV comprehension and generation benchmarks show that JavisGPT outperforms existing MLLMs, particularly in complex and temporally synchronized settings.

*Qihang Peng,Xuesong Chen,Chenye Yang,Shaoshuai Shi,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColaVLA is a unified vision-language-action framework addressing challenges in VLM-based planners for autonomous driving by transferring reasoning to a latent space and using a hierarchical parallel decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the mismatch between text reasoning and continuous control, high latency from chain-of-thought decoding, and inefficiency in real-time deployment in current VLM-based planners.

Method: Proposes ColaVLA with a Cognitive Latent Reasoner for compact scene understanding and a Hierarchical Parallel Planner for multi-scale trajectory generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark with efficiency, robustness, and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: ColaVLA successfully integrates VLMs' strengths into autonomous driving, enabling safe and efficient trajectory generation.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires generating safe and reliable trajectories from complex multimodal inputs. Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

*Zhicheng Zhao,Xuanang Fan,Lingma Sun,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRMNet improves detection of dense tiny objects in remote sensing images by using density maps to guide adaptive feature learning and local-global interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with dense object detection due to uniform resource allocation and lack of focus on dense regions, leading to poor feature learning.

Method: DRMNet introduces Density Generation Branch (DGB) for spatial priors, Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) for efficient local-global interactions, and Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM) to enhance multi-scale features.

Result: DRMNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on AI-TOD and DTOD datasets, especially in high-density and occluded scenarios.

Conclusion: DRMNet effectively addresses challenges in dense tiny object detection by leveraging density-guided adaptive learning and feature enhancement.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery increasingly contains dense clusters of tiny objects, the detection of which is extremely challenging due to severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints. Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD and DTOD datasets demonstrate that DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.

TL;DR: CLIP-Joint-Detect integrates CLIP-style contrastive learning with standard object detection, improving performance on imbalanced and noisy datasets while maintaining real-time speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-entropy classification in detectors is prone to class imbalance and label noise, prompting the need for a more robust framework.

Method: A lightweight parallel head projects features into CLIP embedding space, aligning them with learnable text embeddings via InfoNCE loss and auxiliary cross-entropy, optimizing all detection losses jointly.

Result: Substantial improvements on Pascal VOC and MS COCO benchmarks using Faster R-CNN and YOLOv11, preserving real-time inference.

Conclusion: Joint optimization with learnable text embeddings enhances closed-set detection performance across architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Conventional object detectors rely on cross-entropy classification, which can be vulnerable to class imbalance and label noise. We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that joint optimization with learnable text embeddings markedly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: WRCFormer is a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw 4D radar cubes with camera data using multi-view representations and wavelet-based features, improving accuracy and robustness in adverse weather.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of sparse 4D radar data and computational costs by fusing radar and camera inputs for better perception in autonomous driving.

Method: Uses a Wavelet Attention Module in a wavelet-based FPN for feature enhancement and Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion for multi-view feature integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on K-Radar benchmarks, with 2.4% overall and 1.6% sleet scenario improvements.

Conclusion: WRCFormer effectively integrates raw radar and camera data, proving robust in adverse conditions and outperforming existing models.

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been widely adopted in autonomous driving and robot perception due to its low cost and all-weather robustness. However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of the decoupled radar cube. Specifically, we design a Wavelet Attention Module as the basic module of wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the representation of sparse radar signals and image data. We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing the best model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in the sleet scenario, highlighting its robustness under adverse weather conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO-IOD addresses catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental object detection by resolving knowledge conflicts and introducing efficient fine-tuning components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional incremental object detection methods fail to integrate with real-time YOLO frameworks, highlighting the need for a YOLO-based solution.

Method: YOLO-IOD employs Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement, Importance-based Kernel Selection, and Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation to enhance incremental learning.

Result: YOLO-IOD outperforms existing methods on conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks, showing minimal forgetting.

Conclusion: The proposed YOLO-IOD framework successfully enables real-time incremental object detection while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Current methods for incremental object detection (IOD) primarily rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR series detectors; however, these approaches do not accommodate the real-time YOLO detection frameworks. In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.

TL;DR: ReamCamo is a new framework for generating realistic camouflaged images by improving semantic coherence and visual fidelity through layout controls and multi-modal conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camouflaged image generation methods produce images that either lack sufficient camouflage or have cluttered backgrounds, creating a gap compared to real imagery.

Method: ReamCamo uses layout controls to regulate global image structure and combines textual task descriptions with texture-oriented background retrieval for multi-modal guidance.

Result: The framework enhances semantic coherence and visual realism, validated by quantitative metrics and extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ReamCamo bridges the gap in camouflaged image generation, offering improved realism and effectiveness for training in camouflaged object detection.

Abstract: Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current 6DoF pose estimation methods in high-speed and low-light scenarios where RGB cameras struggle with motion blur.

Method: Proposes PoseStreamer with three core components: Adaptive Pose Memory Queue for temporal consistency, Object-centric 2D Tracker for 2D priors, and Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement.

Result: PoseStreamer achieves superior accuracy in high-speed scenarios and shows strong generalizability for unseen objects.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently handles high-speed pose estimation challenges and is validated through experiments and a novel dataset.

Abstract: Six degree of freedom (6DoF) pose estimation for novel objects is a critical task in computer vision, yet it faces significant challenges in high-speed and low-light scenarios where standard RGB cameras suffer from motion blur. While event cameras offer a promising solution due to their high temporal resolution, current 6DoF pose estimation methods typically yield suboptimal performance in high-speed object moving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseStreamer not only achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios, but also exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects.

*Linglin Liao,Qichuan Geng,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to improve text-guided medical image segmentation by addressing limitations in handling hybrid medical texts and spatial constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with processing diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to inaccurate segmentation.

Method: The SSA framework uses symmetric optimal transport alignment for bi-directional multimodal correspondences and a composite directional guidance strategy for spatial constraints.

Result: SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in segmenting lesions with spatial relational constraints.

Conclusion: The SSA framework effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by leveraging hybrid medical texts and spatial awareness.

Abstract: Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation has shown considerable promise for medical image segmentation, with rich clinical text serving as an effective supplement for scarce data. However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text "in the left lower lung", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.

TL;DR: A reverse personalization framework for face anonymization using conditional diffusion inversion and identity-guided conditioning, achieving control over facial attributes without text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identity modification rely on pre-trained models or fine-tuning, lacking control over facial attributes.

Method: Utilizes conditional diffusion inversion and an identity-guided conditioning branch for direct image manipulation.

Result: Balances identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality better than prior methods.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes beyond pre-trained subjects and enables attribute-controllable anonymization.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation of realistic facial images conditioned on textual prompts and human identities, enabling creating personalized facial imagery. However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts. To generalize beyond subjects in the model's training data, we incorporate an identity-guided conditioning branch. Unlike prior anonymization methods, which lack control over facial attributes, our framework supports attribute-controllable anonymization. We demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality.

Motivation: Existing methods rely on pre-defined Object Lookup Tables, limiting their application in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets.

Result: OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and a 17.6% improvement on the new OpenTarget dataset.

Conclusion: OpenGround effectively addresses the limitations of pre-defined OLTs, enabling robust 3D visual grounding in open-world scenarios.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to locate objects based on natural language descriptions in 3D scenes. Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) framework for contextual object classification, outperforming context-agnostic and multimodal baselines with 73.4% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational object recognition systems often ignore contextual information, which humans naturally use. This work emphasizes context's importance and proposes a structured, interpretable solution.

Method: The framework constructs a GSCG from images, integrating metric depth estimation with panoptic and material segmentation. It uses graph-based classifiers leveraging object features, neighbor interactions, and global scene context.

Result: The context-aware model achieves 73.4% accuracy, significantly higher than context-agnostic versions (38.4%), ResNet models (53.5%), and multimodal LLM baselines (42.3%).

Conclusion: Explicitly structured and interpretable context, as implemented via GSCG, is superior for object recognition, as demonstrated on COCO 2017 datasets.

Abstract: Humans effortlessly identify objects by leveraging a rich understanding of the surrounding scene, including spatial relationships, material properties, and the co-occurrence of other objects. In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%. These results on COCO 2017 train/val splits highlight the superiority of explicitly structured and interpretable context for object recognition tasks.

TL;DR: Co2S is a semi-supervised remote sensing image segmentation framework that combines vision-language and self-supervised models to address pseudo-label drift, improving segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle pseudo-label drift in semi-supervised RS image segmentation by leveraging priors from CLIP and DINOv3 models.

Method: Uses a dual-student architecture with ViT-based models initialized with CLIP and DINOv3, introduces semantic co-guidance, and employs global-local feature fusion.

Result: Achieves leading performance on six datasets across various partition protocols and scenarios.

Conclusion: Co2S effectively mitigates error accumulation and enhances semantic consistency in RS segmentation.

Abstract: Semi-supervised remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of exhaustive annotation, yet it fundamentally struggles with pseudo-label drift, a phenomenon where confirmation bias leads to the accumulation of errors during training. In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAM3C is a self-supervised framework that learns 3D representations from unlabeled videos, achieving better performance than previous methods without real 3D scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale 3D scene scans is expensive, prompting exploration of learning 3D representations from unlabeled videos.

Method: Uses video-generated point clouds and introduces RoomTours dataset. Proposes noise-regularized loss for stable learning.

Result: Outperforms previous self-supervised methods on indoor segmentation tasks without real 3D scans.

Conclusion: Unlabeled videos are a viable, abundant source for 3D self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D self-supervised learning, collecting large-scale 3D scene scans remains expensive and labor-intensive. In this work, we investigate whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors. We present Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework that learns from video-generated point clouds from unlabeled videos. We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model. We also propose a noise-regularized loss that stabilizes representation learning by enforcing local geometric smoothness and ensuring feature stability under noisy point clouds. Remarkably, without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than the previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation. These results suggest that unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning.

### [109] [Video-BrowseComp: Benchmarking Agentic Video Research on Open Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23044)
*Zhengyang Liang,Yan Shu,Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Kaixin Liang,Paolo Rota,Nicu Sebe,Zheng Liu,Lizi Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video-BrowseComp, a benchmark for open-web agentic video reasoning, highlighting a gap in dynamic video processing compared to textual or static multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks evaluating proactive video reasoning, where agents must navigate and verify claims in dynamic video content.

Method: Developed Video-BrowseComp, a benchmark with 210 questions requiring temporal visual evidence and cross-referencing with the open web.

Result: State-of-the-art models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24% accuracy, showing reliance on textual proxies and failure in metadata-sparse environments.

Conclusion: Video-BrowseComp fills a critical gap, pushing research toward proactive video reasoning beyond passive perception.

Abstract: The evolution of autonomous agents is redefining information seeking, transitioning from passive retrieval to proactive, open-ended web research. However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential. As the first open-web video research benchmark, Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive perception toward proactive video reasoning.

*Brayden Miao,Zain Rehman,Xin Miao,Siming Liu,Jianjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline using MedSAM for lung extraction, showing task-dependent benefits of masking in improving robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated CXR interpretation is challenging due to weak disease signals and dataset bias. The study aims to leverage MedSAM for anatomically grounded priors to enhance classification.

Method: MedSAM is fine-tuned for lung extraction and applied to NIH CXR dataset for multi-label classification of five abnormalities. Masking effects are evaluated across tasks and architectures.

Result: MedSAM produces plausible lung masks. Masking effects vary: ResNet50 performs best unmasked, loose masking improves No Finding detection, while tight masking aids training efficiency.

Conclusion: Lung masking should be tailored to the backbone and clinical goal, acting as a controllable spatial prior rather than a uniform solution.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is widely used for screening and diagnosing pulmonary abnormalities, yet automated interpretation remains challenging due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.

### [111] [PathoSyn: Imaging-Pathology MRI Synthesis via Disentangled Deviation Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23130)
*Jian Wang,Sixing Rong,Jiarui Xing,Yuling Xu,Weide Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathoSyn is a generative framework for MRI image synthesis that disentangles pathology from anatomy, using a diffusion model for localized deviations while preserving structural integrity. It outperforms existing methods in realism and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for MRI synthesis often fail to separate pathological features from anatomical structures, leading to corrupted outputs. PathoSyn aims to address this by disentangling the two.

Method: PathoSyn decomposes synthesis into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling using a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model, coupled with seam-aware fusion and stabilization.

Result: PathoSyn outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity for tumor imaging benchmarks.

Conclusion: PathoSyn offers a principled approach for high-fidelity synthetic MRI datasets, aiding diagnostic algorithm development and clinical decision support.

Abstract: We present PathoSyn, a unified generative framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image synthesis that reformulates imaging-pathology as a disentangled additive deviation on a stable anatomical manifold. Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The source code of this work will be made publicly available.

### [112] [Domain-Shift Immunity in Deep Deformable Registration via Local Feature Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23142)
*Mingzhen Shao,Sarang Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning improves deformable image registration but is thought sensitive to domain shifts. UniReg, a universal framework, shows domain-shift immunity stems from local feature reliance, not global appearance, enabling robust cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deep learning models for deformable image registration exhibit domain-shift immunity and to validate this mechanism through a universal framework.

Method: Introduces UniReg, decoupling feature extraction (using fixed pre-trained features) from deformation estimation (via UNet) to isolate local feature reliance.

Result: UniReg achieves robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance despite training on a single dataset, comparable to optimization-based methods.

Conclusion: Local feature consistency drives robustness in learning-based deformable registration; early CNN biases cause modality shift failures, guiding future backbone designs.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced deformable image registration, surpassing traditional optimization-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency. However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.

*Jingyu Li,Xiaolong Zhao,Zhe Liu,Wenxiao Wu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoTeacher enhances semi-supervised 3D object detection by focusing on geometric relations and introducing keypoint-based supervision and voxel-wise augmentation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect the challenge of capturing geometric information with limited labeled data, which is crucial for object perception and localization.

Method: Proposes GeoTeacher with a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module and a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy, including a distance-decay mechanism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on ONCE and Waymo datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and generalization.

Conclusion: GeoTeacher improves geometric understanding in semi-supervised 3D object detection and can be integrated with other methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection, aiming to explore unlabeled data for boosting 3D object detectors, has emerged as an active research area in recent years. Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

*Fulin Shi,Wenyi Xiao,Bin Chen,Liang Din,Leilei Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REVEALER is a framework for evaluating text-to-image alignment using reinforcement-guided visual reasoning, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for text-to-image alignment lack fine-grained interpretability and fail to align with human preferences, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: REVEALER employs a 'grounding-reasoning-conclusion' paradigm with MLLMs, optimized via GRPO using a composite reward function for element-level alignment evaluation.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing proprietary models and baselines in efficiency.

Conclusion: REVEALER offers a unified, interpretable, and efficient approach for evaluating text-to-image alignment, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Evaluating the alignment between textual prompts and generated images is critical for ensuring the reliability and usability of text-to-image (T2I) models. However, most existing evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines, which lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences. To address this, we propose REVEALER, a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation based on reinforcement-guided visual reasoning. Adopting a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm, our method enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments. We optimize the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) using a composite reward function that incorporates structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks-EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, and GenAI-Bench-demonstrate that REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our approach consistently outperforms both strong proprietary models and supervised baselines while demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to existing iterative visual reasoning methods.

### [115] [GVSynergy-Det: Synergistic Gaussian-Voxel Representations for Multi-View 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23176)
*Yi Zhang,Yi Wang,Lei Yao,Lap-Pui Chau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GVSynergy-Det is a novel framework for image-based 3D object detection that synergizes Gaussian and voxel representations to improve accuracy without dense supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either need dense 3D supervision or underperform due to poor geometry extraction. GVSynergy-Det addresses this gap by leveraging complementary strengths of Gaussian and voxel representations.

Method: The framework uses a dual-representation architecture: Gaussian Splatting captures fine details, while voxels provide spatial context. A cross-representation enhancement mechanism integrates features from both representations.

Result: GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes benchmarks without requiring depth or dense 3D supervision.

Conclusion: The synergistic use of Gaussian and voxel representations improves 3D detection accuracy, outperforming existing methods while eliminating costly supervision requirements.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection aims to identify and localize objects in 3D space using only RGB images, eliminating the need for expensive depth sensors required by point cloud-based methods. Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).

*Tianchen Deng,Xuefeng Chen,Yi Chen,Qu Chen,Yuyao Xu,Lijin Yang,Le Xu,Yu Zhang,Bo Zhang,Wuxiong Huang,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified Driving World Model (DWM) using 3D Gaussian scene representation for improved 3D scene understanding and multi-modal generation, addressing limitations of existing DWMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding and struggle with aligning textual information to 3D scenes, prompting the need for a more effective framework.

Method: The approach uses 3D Gaussian scene representation, embedding linguistic features into Gaussians for modality alignment, and introduces task-aware language-guided sampling and dual-condition multi-modal generation.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and NuInteract datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DWM framework enhances 3D scene understanding and multi-modal generation, with plans to release the code publicly.

Abstract: Driving World Models (DWMs) have been developing rapidly with the advances of generative models. However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We will release the code publicly on GitHub https://github.com/dtc111111/GaussianDWM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance forest cover mapping accuracy by integrating OBIA with DL models, leveraging Sentinel-2 imagery for environmental monitoring.

Method: Evaluates DL models (UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, ResNet50-Segnet) on Sentinel-2 data, integrates best performers with OBIA, and compares with traditional OBIA.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy (94.54% with ResUNet-OBIA, 95.64% with AttentionUNet-OBIA) vs. traditional OBIA (92.91%). Demonstrates QGIS's utility for mapping.

Conclusion: ForCM improves forest cover mapping accuracy, supporting conservation efforts. Highlights potential of accessible tools like QGIS for environmental monitoring.

Abstract: This research proposes "ForCM", a novel approach to forest cover mapping that combines Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) with Deep Learning (DL) using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy. The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods. The results show that the proposed ForCM method improves forest cover mapping, achieving overall accuracies of 94.54 percent with ResUNet-OBIA and 95.64 percent with AttentionUNet-OBIA, compared to 92.91 percent using traditional OBIA. This research also demonstrates the potential of free and user-friendly tools such as QGIS for accurate mapping within their limitations, supporting global environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.

*Jongoh Jeong,Youngjin Oh,Gyeongrae Nam,Jeongeun Lee,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving military object detection using synthetic RGB data from Unreal Engine, addressing challenges like high SAR data costs and limited datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Military object detection faces challenges due to varied environments and high SAR data costs, prompting the use of affordable RGB-based synthetic data.

Method: The authors generate synthetic RGB data using Unreal Engine and conduct synthetic-to-real transfer experiments, benchmarking domain adaptation methods.

Result: Methods using minimal hints (e.g., object class) outperform unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches in cross-domain adaptation.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of synthetic data for military detection but identifies remaining challenges for improvement.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the key target tasks of interest in the context of civil and military applications. In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome.

*Changgyoon Oh,Jongoh Jeong,Jegyeong Cho,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive timestep selection and feature consolidation modules to improve few-shot dense prediction tasks using diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models rely on heuristic timestep feature selection, which can be suboptimal. The study aims to optimize this for better performance in few-shot dense prediction tasks.

Method: Two modules are proposed: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) for adaptive timestep choice, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to enhance selected features. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter is also included.

Result: The framework achieves superior dense prediction performance in few-shot settings, validated on the Taskonomy dataset.

Conclusion: The adaptive approach effectively optimizes diffusion timestep features for few-shot dense prediction, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have brought tremendous advances in generative tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance thus far. Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.

*Jongoh Jeong,Taek-Jin Song,Jong-Hwan Kim,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AVOID, a new dataset for real-time obstacle detection under adverse conditions, addressing gaps in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack diverse adverse conditions and uniform visual domains for road obstacles, which is crucial for reliable detection.

Method: AVOID is created in a simulated environment, featuring diverse weather and daylight conditions, coupled with semantic/depth maps, LiDAR data, and waypoints.

Result: The dataset supports various visual tasks and is benchmarked on high-performing networks for obstacle detection.

Conclusion: AVOID fills a critical gap in datasets for autonomous driving, enabling better performance under adverse conditions.

Abstract: Understanding road scenes for visual perception remains crucial for intelligent self-driving cars. In particular, it is desirable to detect unexpected small road hazards reliably in real-time, especially under varying adverse conditions (e.g., weather and daylight). However, existing road driving datasets provide large-scale images acquired in either normal or adverse scenarios only, and often do not contain the road obstacles captured in the same visual domain as for the other classes. To address this, we introduce a new dataset called AVOID, the Adverse Visual Conditions Dataset, for real-time obstacle detection collected in a simulated environment. AVOID consists of a large set of unexpected road obstacles located along each path captured under various weather and time conditions. Each image is coupled with the corresponding semantic and depth maps, raw and semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints, thereby supporting most visual perception tasks. We benchmark the results on high-performing real-time networks for the obstacle detection task, and also propose and conduct ablation studies using a comprehensive multi-task network for semantic segmentation, depth and waypoint prediction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-UAVBench, a benchmark to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in low-altitude UAV scenarios, revealing current models' limitations and identifying key challenges for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack coverage of low-altitude UAV challenges, and current evaluations focus on specific tasks, not general MLLM intelligence in these scenarios.

Method: The authors develop MM-UAVBench, a benchmark with 19 subtasks and 5.7K annotated questions derived from real-world UAV data, evaluating MLLMs across perception, cognition, and planning dimensions.

Result: Experiments on 16 MLLMs show poor adaptation to low-altitude scenarios, highlighting bottlenecks like spatial bias and multi-view understanding.

Conclusion: MM-UAVBench aims to drive research toward robust MLLMs for UAV applications by addressing identified challenges.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable general intelligence across diverse domains, their potential in low-altitude applications dominated by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remains largely underexplored. Existing MLLM benchmarks rarely cover the unique challenges of low-altitude scenarios, while UAV-related evaluations mainly focus on specific tasks such as localization or navigation, without a unified evaluation of MLLMs'general intelligence. To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Our analyses further uncover critical bottlenecks such as spatial bias and multi-view understanding that hinder the effective deployment of MLLMs in UAV scenarios. We hope MM-UAVBench will foster future research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence.

*Youngchae Kwon,Jinyoung Choi,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Holi-DETR improves fashion item detection by integrating contextual information (co-occurrence, spatial arrangements, and body-keypoints) into a DETR framework, boosting performance over vanilla DETR and Co-DETR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguities in fashion item detection arise from diverse appearances and subcategory similarities, prompting the need for holistic contextual analysis.

Method: Proposes Holi-DETR, a transformer-based detector leveraging co-occurrence, spatial arrangements, and body-keypoint relationships to detect items holistically.

Result: Achieves improvements of 3.6pp over vanilla DETR and 1.1pp over Co-DETR in average precision.

Conclusion: Incorporating contextual information holistically enhances fashion item detection performance.

Abstract: Fashion item detection is challenging due to the ambiguities introduced by the highly diverse appearances of fashion items and the similarities among item subcategories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP).

*Jiaxu Zhang,Tianshu Hu,Yuan Zhang,Zenan Li,Linjie Luo,Guosheng Lin,Xin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMAGE is a unified model combining script drafting and key-shot design for AI-driven video creation, using Mixture-of-Transformers and a novel training paradigm to enhance narrative logic and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems treat script drafting and key-shot design as separate tasks, but UniMAGE argues for unification to mimic film director qualities.

Method: Employs Mixture-of-Transformers architecture and a 'first interleaving, then disentangling' training paradigm involving Interleaved Concept Learning and Disentangled Expert Learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing logically coherent scripts and visually consistent keyframes.

Conclusion: UniMAGE successfully bridges user prompts with structured scripts, enabling non-experts to create multi-shot films.

Abstract: Existing AI-driven video creation systems typically treat script drafting and key-shot design as two disjoint tasks: the former relies on large language models, while the latter depends on image generation models. We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-effective method to generate high-quality synthetic defect images using pre-trained models and a two-stage training strategy, improving anomaly detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in industrial manufacturing suffers from scarce real defect images, prompting the need for efficient synthetic data generation.

Method: Leverages a pre-trained image-to-image translation model and an image retrieval model to generate and filter synthetic defect images, followed by a two-stage training strategy.

Result: Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset show improved anomaly detection performance with reduced data collection costs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances cost and quality in synthetic defect generation, enhancing anomaly detection.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing. Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Minwoo Kim,Hongki Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS) improves diffusion model-based inverse problem solving by reducing error accumulation, achieving high-quality reconstructions with fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current iterative diffusion models for inverse problems require many steps due to error accumulation, limiting efficiency.

Method: SGPS corrects sampling deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradients and PCA noise estimation, focusing on early and middle stages.

Result: SGPS achieves high-quality reconstructions with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), outperforming existing methods at low NFE counts.

Conclusion: SGPS enhances diffusion model efficiency for inverse problems by minimizing error accumulation, enabling faster and more accurate reconstructions.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful learned priors for solving inverse problems. However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.

TL;DR: PEG-DRNet introduces novel modules like Gas Block, AGPEO, and CASR-PAN to detect faint infrared gas leaks, achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting infrared gas leaks is challenging due to their faint, small, and weak-contrast nature, demanding advanced solutions for environmental and industrial safety.

Method: Combines Gas Block for gas transport modeling, AGPEO for reliable edge priors, and CASR-PAN for selective feature propagation across scales.

Result: Achieves 29.8% AP, 84.3% AP50, and 25.3% small-object AP with 43.7 Gflops and 14.9M parameters, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: PEG-DRNet excels in accuracy and efficiency, surpassing CNN and Transformer detectors in gas leak detection.

Abstract: Detecting infrared gas leaks is critical for environmental monitoring and industrial safety, yet remains difficult because plumes are faint, small, semitransparent, and have weak, diffuse boundaries. We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet). First, we introduce the Gas Block, a diffusion-convection unit modeling gas transport: a local branch captures short-range variations, while a large-kernel branch captures long-range propagation. An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\%, 6.5\%, and 5.3\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters. The proposed PEG-DRNet achieves superior overall performance with the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer detectors in AP and AP$_{50}$ on the IIG and LangGas dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free, two-stage data pruning method to improve diffusion-based RS generative foundation models by removing redundant, noisy, and imbalanced data efficiently, enhancing convergence and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RS diffusion models suffer from inefficiency due to redundant, noisy, and imbalanced data, and simplistic deduplication ignores heterogeneity. A better method is needed.

Method: Proposes a two-stage pruning: 1) entropy-based removal of low-information samples, and 2) scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling for balanced selection.

Result: Pruning 85% of data improves convergence and generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art downstream performance in tasks like super-resolution.

Conclusion: The method efficiently prunes data for RS generative models, enhancing performance and offering practical guidance.

Abstract: Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework with Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM) to enhance multimodal fusion in remote sensing, improving efficiency and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack adaptive resolution balancing and semantic hierarchy in alignment, limiting accuracy and efficiency in surface information extraction.

Method: Proposes DRIS for adaptive computational resource allocation and MS-VLAM for multi-scale semantic alignment (object, local-region, global).

Result: Outperforms conventional methods in accuracy (BLEU-4, CIDEr) and efficiency (R@10) on RS-GPT4V dataset.

Conclusion: The framework advances efficient multimodal remote sensing systems, offering theoretical and technical insights for intelligent interpretation.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion of remote sensing images serves as a core technology for overcoming the limitations of single-source data and improving the accuracy of surface information extraction, which exhibits significant application value in fields such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval. This technical framework provides a novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying a theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for the engineering application of intelligent remote sensing interpretation.

*Xingwei Ma,Shiyang Feng,Bo Zhang,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLaCD-R1 is a two-stage framework combining a Multi-Image Reasoner and Mask-Guided Decoder to improve semantic change detection in remote sensing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pixel-based and encoder-decoder approaches lack semantic understanding and robustness to non-semantic changes, while multimodal methods struggle with localization and boundary precision.

Method: ViLaCD-R1 uses a VLM fine-tuned via SFT and RL for coarse change masks, then refines them with a decoder integrating dual-temporal features.

Result: The framework excels in semantic change recognition, suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViLaCD-R1 addresses limitations of existing methods, offering superior performance in complex real-world remote sensing change detection tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD), a complex multi-image inference task, traditionally uses pixel-based operators or encoder-decoder networks that inadequately capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: ASemconsist introduces selective text embedding modification and adaptive feature-sharing to maintain character identity consistency across images without sacrificing prompt alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models struggle with balancing character identity consistency and prompt alignment.

Method: Proposes ASemconsist with selective text embedding modification, semantic control via padding embeddings, adaptive feature-sharing, and introduces Consistency Quality Score (CQS) for evaluation.

Result: ASemconsist achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully maintains identity consistency and prompt alignment, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality and text alignment. However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs. Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/asemconsist

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework improves edge clarity in image representation by integrating segmentation priors and avoiding cross-boundary blending.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D Gaussian Splatting methods often produce blurry boundaries with few Gaussians due to lack of contour awareness.

Method: The proposed framework incorporates object segmentation priors, constraints Gaussians to specific regions during rasterization, and includes a warm-up scheme for training stability.

Result: Higher reconstruction quality around edges is achieved, especially with few Gaussians, while maintaining fast rendering and low memory usage.

Conclusion: The method effectively preserves edge structures under compression, outperforming existing 2DGS approaches.

Abstract: Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage.

*Tong Shao,Yusen Fu,Guoying Sun,Jingde Kong,Zhuotao Tian,Jingyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel plugin, CEM, optimizes fidelity in diffusion model acceleration by minimizing cumulative error dynamically, improving existing methods without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The slow inference of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) limits their applicability. Caching-based acceleration methods suffer from computational errors, and fixed strategies fail to adapt to error variations.

Method: CEM minimizes cumulative error via a dynamic programming algorithm, leveraging predefined error sensitivity influenced by timesteps and cache intervals.

Result: CEM significantly improves generation fidelity across nine models and quantized methods, outperforming original performance on benchmarks like FLUX.1-dev and StableDiffusion1.5.

Conclusion: CEM is a versatile, model-agnostic solution that enhances diffusion model acceleration fidelity, adaptable to any budget and integrable into existing frameworks.

Abstract: Although Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a predominant architecture for image and video generation, its iterative denoising process results in slow inference, which hinders broader applicability and development. Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: YOLO-Master introduces adaptive computation for real-time object detection, improving efficiency and accuracy by dynamically allocating resources based on scene complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RTOD methods like YOLO use uniform computation for all inputs, wasting resources on simple scenes and underperforming on complex ones.

Method: Proposes YOLO-Master with an ES-MoE block and dynamic routing network to allocate computational resources adaptively.

Result: Achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency on MS COCO, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference.

Conclusion: YOLO-Master enhances detection performance, especially in dense scenes, while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Abstract: Existing Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD) methods commonly adopt YOLO-like architectures for their favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available.

Result: Achieved 2nd place in the MiGA 2025 Challenge for emotion prediction, demonstrating strong accuracy.

Conclusion: The frameworks effectively combine spatial and pose information for nuanced behavior and emotion analysis.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction are both highly challenging tasks that require modeling subtle, fine-grained human behaviors, primarily leveraging video and skeletal pose data. In this work, we present two multimodal frameworks designed to tackle both problems on the iMiGUE dataset. For micro-gesture classification, we explore the complementary strengths of RGB and 3D pose-based representations to capture nuanced spatio-temporal patterns. To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information. For emotion recognition, our framework extends to behavior-based emotion prediction, a binary classification task identifying emotional states based on visual cues. We leverage facial and contextual embeddings extracted using SwinFace and MViTv2-S models and fuse them through an InterFusion module designed to capture emotional expressions and body gestures. Experiments conducted on the iMiGUE dataset, within the scope of the MiGA 2025 Challenge, demonstrate the robust performance and accuracy of our method in the behavior-based emotion prediction task, where our approach secured 2nd place.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD model reconstruction methods lack precision and editability, relying on manual annotations, which limits scalability and industrial applicability.

Method: Proposes CME-CAD, integrating multi-expert models with a two-stage training process (MEFT and MERL) and introduces CADExpert, a benchmark dataset.

Result: CME-CAD improves the generation of accurate, constraint-compatible, and editable CAD models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses challenges in CAD automation, offering enhanced precision and editability for industrial design.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is essential in industrial design, but the complexity of traditional CAD modeling and workflows presents significant challenges for automating the generation of high-precision, editable CAD models. Existing methods that reconstruct 3D models from sketches often produce non-editable and approximate models that fall short of meeting the stringent requirements for precision and editability in industrial design. Moreover, the reliance on text or image-based inputs often requires significant manual annotation, limiting their scalability and applicability in industrial settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm, a novel training paradigm for CAD code generation. Our approach integrates the complementary strengths of these models, facilitating collaborative learning and improving the model's ability to generate accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models. We introduce a two-stage training process: Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT), and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL). Additionally, we present CADExpert, an open-source benchmark consisting of 17,299 instances, including orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations, expert-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, executable CADQuery code, and rendered 3D models.

Motivation: The study aims to uncover the structural and topological foundations of visual representation learning, hypothesizing that semantic understanding necessitates organizing visual observations into discrete states.

Method: The approach involves analyzing visual observation space as a fiber bundle, where nuisance variations populate fibers and semantics reside in the base space. Theoretical consequences are derived regarding the need for discriminative supervision and architectural adaptations.

Result: The paper concludes that semantic invariance requires non-homeomorphic targets (e.g., labels, multimodal alignment) and that model architectures must support topology change (expand-and-snap process) for effective abstraction.

Conclusion: The framework provides a topological interpretation aligning with empirical observations in large-scale models and classical statistical learning principles, offering insights rather than prescriptive solutions.

Abstract: We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.

*Niki Amini-Naieni,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CountGD++, enhancing object counting flexibility by allowing text/visual exclusions, automating annotations, and accepting synthetic/natural examples, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object counting methods lack flexibility in specifying exclusions and require manual annotations, prompting the need for more versatile solutions.

Method: Extends prompts for exclusions, introduces 'pseudo-exemplars' for automated annotations, and integrates synthetic/natural visual examples into counting models.

Result: Significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across datasets, with CountGD++ also serving as a vision expert for LLMs.

Conclusion: The advancements in CountGD++ broaden prompt flexibility in multi-modal open-world counting, enhancing performance and reducing manual effort.

Abstract: The flexibility and accuracy of methods for automatically counting objects in images and videos are limited by the way the object can be specified. While existing methods allow users to describe the target object with text and visual examples, the visual examples must be manually annotated inside the image, and there is no way to specify what not to count. To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt to enable what not to count to be described with text and/or visual examples, introduce the concept of `pseudo-exemplars' that automate the annotation of visual examples at inference, and extend counting models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images. We also use our new counting model, CountGD++, as a vision expert agent for an LLM. Together, these contributions expand the prompt flexibility of multi-modal open-world counting and lead to significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpatialMosaic, a dataset for enhancing spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using multi-view images, addressing challenges like occlusion and low-overlap. It also presents SpatialMosaic-Bench for evaluation and SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework integrating 3D reconstruction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene understanding rely on pre-constructed representations or reconstruction pipelines, limiting scalability. Real-world challenges like partial visibility and occlusion remain under-explored.

Method: The authors propose a scalable pipeline for generating and annotating multi-view data, creating SpatialMosaic (2M QA pairs). They introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench (1M QA pairs) and SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework combining 3D reconstruction models with VLMs.

Result: Experiments show the dataset and tasks improve spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the pipeline's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work advances spatial reasoning in VLMs by addressing real-world challenges and providing scalable solutions through novel datasets and frameworks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for enhanced 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning. However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks. In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline in constructing realistic and diverse QA pairs. Code and dataset will be available soon.

*Yifei Li,Haoyuan He,Yu Zheng,Bingyao Yu,Wenzhao Zheng,Lei Chen,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeXT-IMDL, a benchmark to evaluate the generalization of Image Manipulation Detection and Localization models, revealing their fragility in diverse real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of accessible image editing tools and their misuse necessitates robust IMDL methods. Current evaluations are too simplistic, masking the limitations of existing models.

Method: NeXT-IMDL categorizes AI-generated manipulations along four axes and uses five cross-dimension protocols to test 11 models.

Result: Experiments show existing models fail systematically under diverse generalization scenarios despite performing well in original settings.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for more robust IMDL models and provides a diagnostic toolkit to guide future research.

Abstract: The accessibility surge and abuse risks of user-friendly image editing models have created an urgent need for generalizable, up-to-date methods for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL). Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios. By providing this diagnostic toolkit and the new findings, we aim to advance the development towards building truly robust, next-generation IMDL models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SoulX-LiveTalk introduces a 14B-parameter framework for real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation using bidirectional attention and self-correction mechanisms, achieving sub-second latency and 32 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions compromise visual fidelity due to computational limitations and latency constraints, necessitating a better approach for real-time avatar synthesis.

Method: Uses Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation and Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism, alongside hybrid parallelism and kernel optimizations.

Result: Achieves sub-second start-up latency (0.87s) and real-time throughput of 32 FPS, enhancing motion coherence and visual detail.

Conclusion: SoulX-LiveTalk sets a new benchmark for high-fidelity, interactive digital human synthesis.

Abstract: Deploying massive diffusion models for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation presents a significant engineering challenge, primarily due to the conflict between computational load and strict latency constraints. Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.

*Xiaolan Li,Wanquan Liu,Pengcheng Li,Pengyu Jie,Chenqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOFTooth is a semantics-enhanced 2D-3D fusion framework for accurate 3D tooth segmentation, leveraging 2D foundation models without fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in 3D tooth segmentation include crowded arches, ambiguous boundaries, missing teeth, and rare third molars. Current methods struggle with boundary leakage and inconsistent identities.

Method: SOFTooth combines frozen 2D semantics with 3D features, uses residual gating for boundary refinement, center-guided mask regularization, and order-aware Hungarian matching for coherent labeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and mean IoU on 3DTeethSeg'22, with notable improvements for third molars.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective transfer of 2D semantics to 3D segmentation without fine-tuning, addressing key challenges in dental imaging.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) tooth instance segmentation remains challenging due to crowded arches, ambiguous tooth-gingiva boundaries, missing teeth, and rare yet clinically important third molars. Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.

*Henglin Liu,Nisha Huang,Chang Liu,Jiangpeng Yan,Huijuan Huang,Jixuan Ying,Tong-Yee Lee,Pengfei Wan,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAD dataset and ArtQuant framework to address data scarcity and model fragmentation in aesthetic quality assessment, achieving state-of-the-art results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aesthetic quality assessment is complex and lacks balanced datasets and effective models.

Method: Proposes RAD dataset (70k entries) and ArtQuant framework, leveraging LLM decoders and joint description generation.

Result: Achieves top performance with 33% fewer training epochs, narrowing cognitive gaps in aesthetic judgment.

Conclusion: The approach combines data adequacy and model efficiency, supporting future research in aesthetic assessment.

Abstract: The aesthetic quality assessment task is crucial for developing a human-aligned quantitative evaluation system for AIGC. However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment. We will release both code and dataset to support future research.

TL;DR: DriveLaW unifies video generation and motion planning for autonomous driving, ensuring consistency between future scenario prediction and trajectory planning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models in autonomous driving operate in limited roles, decoupling world prediction and motion planning. DriveLaW aims to bridge this gap by integrating these processes.

Method: DriveLaW combines DriveLaW-Video (a high-fidelity world model) and DriveLaW-Act (a diffusion planner), optimized via a three-stage training strategy.

Result: DriveLaW surpasses previous work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD for video prediction and sets a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

Conclusion: DriveLaW's unified approach enhances both video generation and motion planning, offering significant advancements in autonomous driving.

Abstract: World models have become crucial for autonomous driving, as they learn how scenarios evolve over time to address the long-tail challenges of the real world. However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

*Dohyun Kim,Seungwoo Lyu,Seung Wook Kim,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDSPO introduces a method to improve diffusion models by deriving preference signals directly from winning and losing policies, avoiding costly human-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with aligning outputs to nuanced user intent and maintaining aesthetic quality, relying on expensive human-labeled datasets.

Method: DDSPO uses a pretrained reference model to automatically generate preference signals by contrasting outputs from original prompts and degraded variants, providing dense supervision across the denoising trajectory.

Result: Empirical results show DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing methods with less supervision.

Conclusion: DDSPO offers a practical and effective solution for preference-based training in diffusion models, reducing reliance on costly labeled data.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, yet they often struggle to fully align outputs with nuanced user intent and maintain consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of segmentation models like SAM in shifted or limited-knowledge domains by leveraging uncertainty quantification for enhanced generalizability.

Method: Curated UncertSAM benchmark with eight datasets, evaluated post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods, and assessed uncertainty-guided prediction refinement.

Result: Last-layer Laplace approximation provided meaningful uncertainty estimates correlating with segmentation errors; refinement benefits were preliminary but promising.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty quantification shows potential for improving segmentation model robustness and performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Foundation models for segmentation such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) family exhibit strong zero-shot performance, but remain vulnerable in shifted or limited-knowledge domains. This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification can mitigate such challenges and enhance model generalisability in a domain-agnostic manner. To this end, we (1) curate UncertSAM, a benchmark comprising eight datasets designed to stress-test SAM under challenging segmentation conditions including shadows, transparency, and camouflage; (2) evaluate a suite of lightweight, post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods; and (3) assess a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement step. Among evaluated approaches, a last-layer Laplace approximation yields uncertainty estimates that correlate well with segmentation errors, indicating a meaningful signal. While refinement benefits are preliminary, our findings underscore the potential of incorporating uncertainty into segmentation models to support robust, domain-agnostic performance. Our benchmark and code are made publicly available.

Motivation: Traditional road monitoring is costly and inefficient; this paper aims to improve it using accessible, real-time data.

Method: Collected data via mobile phone cameras and acceleration sensors around KIT, applied deep learning (AlexNet, LeNet, VGG, ResNet) and fuzzy logic for classification.

Result: Achieved over 95% accuracy classifying roads into 5 conditions (e.g., asphalt, damaged asphalt).

Conclusion: Combining image and acceleration data with deep learning is effective for real-time road monitoring, with potential for weather/time-based classification using fuzzy logic.

Abstract: Monitoring states of road surfaces provides valuable information for the planning and controlling vehicles and active vehicle control systems. Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements. This article proposes an real time system based on weather conditional data and road surface condition data. For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved. It is also proposed to use the acceleration or the camera image to classify the road surface according to the weather and the time of day using fuzzy logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce hallucinated content inconsistent with visual inputs, limiting reliability. CoFi-Dec aims to address this issue without additional training.

Method: CoFi-Dec generates intermediate textual responses from coarse- and fine-grained views, transforms them into synthetic images for grounding cues, and uses Wasserstein-based fusion to unify predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments show CoFi-Dec significantly reduces entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming other decoding strategies.

Conclusion: CoFi-Dec provides a robust, model-agnostic solution for mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs, requiring no extra training and applicable broadly.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multi-modal understanding and generation. However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.

Method: The framework integrates image preprocessing, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and LLM-based numeric reading extraction, leveraging YOLOv8 and multimodal models.

Result: Waterline detection achieved 94.24% precision; Gemini 2.0 Flash showed the highest accuracy (MAE: 5.43 cm, RMSE: 8.58 cm, R²: 0.84). Performance declined with poor image quality.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is scalable and efficient, offering robust automated hydrological monitoring and potential for real-time river gauge digitization.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of river water levels is essential for flood forecasting, water resource management, and ecological protection. Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation. Overall, the proposed approach offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for automated hydrological monitoring, demonstrating potential for real time river gauge digitization and improved water resource management.

TL;DR: Dual-approx Bridge introduces a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual neural network approximators for deterministic I2I translation, delivering high-fidelity outputs with negligible variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve deterministic Image-to-Image (I2I) translation by ensuring consistent, high-fidelity outputs closely matching ground truth, addressing limitations of existing stochastic and deterministic methods.

Method: Proposes Dual-approx Bridge, leveraging Brownian bridge dynamics and dual neural network approximators (forward and reverse processes) for faithful I2I translation.

Result: Outperforms stochastic and deterministic baselines in image generation and super-resolution, achieving superior image quality and faithfulness to GT.

Conclusion: Dual-approx Bridge is effective for deterministic I2I translations, offering high fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: Image-to-Image (I2I) translation involves converting an image from one domain to another. Deterministic I2I translation, such as in image super-resolution, extends this concept by guaranteeing that each input generates a consistent and predictable output, closely matching the ground truth (GT) with high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse process) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of image quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

*Shuyuan Lin,Wenwu Peng,Junjie Huang,Qiang Qi,Miaohui Wang,Jian Weng*

TL;DR: MCI-Net improves point cloud registration by integrating multi-domain contextual cues, enhancing feature discriminability, and dynamically optimizing inlier weights, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture implicit semantics and structural consistency in point clouds, limiting feature learning and registration quality.

Method: MCI-Net includes graph neighborhood aggregation, progressive context interaction, and dynamic inlier selection to enhance feature representation and registration robustness.

Result: MCI-Net achieves 96.4% registration recall on 3DMatch, outperforming existing methods on indoor and outdoor datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MCI-Net effectively addresses limitations of current approaches, significantly improving point cloud registration performance.

Abstract: Robust and discriminative feature learning is critical for high-quality point cloud registration. However, existing deep learning-based methods typically rely on Euclidean neighborhood-based strategies for feature extraction, which struggle to effectively capture the implicit semantics and structural consistency in point clouds. To address these issues, we propose a multi-domain context integration network (MCI-Net) that improves feature representation and registration performance by aggregating contextual cues from diverse domains. Specifically, we propose a graph neighborhood aggregation module, which constructs a global graph to capture the overall structural relationships within point clouds. We then propose a progressive context interaction module to enhance feature discriminability by performing intra-domain feature decoupling and inter-domain context interaction. Finally, we design a dynamic inlier selection method that optimizes inlier weights using residual information from multiple iterations of pose estimation, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of registration. Extensive experiments on indoor RGB-D and outdoor LiDAR datasets show that the proposed MCI-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest registration recall of 96.4\% on 3DMatch.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SC-Net, a novel CNN-based network, addresses global context aggregation and motion field oversmoothing in two-view correspondence learning by integrating spatial and channel context via AFR, BFA, and PAR modules, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN backbones for two-view correspondence learning lack task-specific tailoring, leading to ineffective global context aggregation and oversmoothed dense motion fields in large disparity scenes.

Method: SC-Net incorporates an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) for position-awareness, a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) for refining motion fields, and a position-aware recovery module (PAR) for precise motion vector recovery.

Result: SC-Net achieves superior performance in relative pose estimation and outlier removal on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SC-Net effectively addresses the limitations of existing CNN backbones, enhancing accuracy and robustness in two-view correspondence learning.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbones in two-view correspondence learning, demonstrating significant superiority over methods based on multilayer perceptrons. However, CNN backbones that are not tailored to specific tasks may fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity. To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we recover the motion vectors from the refined field using a position-aware recovery module (PAR) that ensures consistency and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

### [155] [TV-RAG: A Temporal-aware and Semantic Entropy-Weighted Framework for Long Video Retrieval and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23483)
*Zongsheng Cao,Yangfan He,Anran Liu,Feng Chen,Zepeng Wang,Jun Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TV-RAG is a training-free framework enhancing long-video reasoning by combining temporal alignment and entropy-guided semantics, outperforming baselines on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with long videos due to narrow temporal windows and poor semantic shift detection, while text-based retrieval ignores multimodal interdependence.

Method: TV-RAG introduces a time-decay retrieval module for temporal context and an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler for efficient, representative frame selection.

Result: TV-RAG consistently exceeds leading baselines on benchmarks like Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: TV-RAG provides a lightweight, effective solution for improving long-video reasoning in LVLMs, validated by superior benchmark performance.

Abstract: Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

*Mingyuan Jiu,Hailong Zhu,Wenchuan Wei,Hichem Sahbi,Rongrong Ji,Mingliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanCAN hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in Hilbert space, enhancing scene understanding and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in multi-label classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual recognition methods often miss cross-scale contextual interactions between objects, limiting their discriminative power. PanCAN aims to address this by integrating multi-order geometric contexts hierarchically.

Method: PanCAN combines random walks with an attention mechanism to learn multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale. It dynamically fuses features across scales through attention-based aggregation.

Result: PanCAN achieves competitive results on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in multi-label classification.

Conclusion: PanCAN's hierarchical integration of multi-order and cross-scale contexts significantly improves scene understanding and multi-label classification performance.

Abstract: Context modeling is crucial for visual recognition, enabling highly discriminative image representations by integrating both intrinsic and extrinsic relationships between objects and labels in images. A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features. Extensive multi-label classification experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, thereby substantially improving multi-label classification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-centric story generation faces challenges like maintaining detailed and diverse human face consistency and coordinating multiple characters across images.

Method: The framework uses Iterative Identity Discovery to extract cohesive character identities and Re-denoising Identity Injection to inject identities while preserving context.

Result: Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark show IdentityStory excels in face consistency and handles multi-character combinations.

Conclusion: IdentityStory demonstrates strong potential for applications like infinite-length story generation and dynamic character composition.

Abstract: Recent visual generative models enable story generation with consistent characters from text, but human-centric story generation faces additional challenges, such as maintaining detailed and diverse human face consistency and coordinating multiple characters across different images. This paper presents IdentityStory, a framework for human-centric story generation that ensures consistent character identity across multiple sequential images. By taming identity-preserving generators, the framework features two key components: Iterative Identity Discovery, which extracts cohesive character identities, and Re-denoising Identity Injection, which re-denoises images to inject identities while preserving desired context. Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark demonstrate that IdentityStory outperforms existing methods, particularly in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations. The framework also shows strong potential for applications such as infinite-length story generation and dynamic character composition.

*Hexin Zhang,Dong Li,Jie Huang,Bingzhou Wang,Xueyang Fu,Zhengjun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAFS is a training-free framework combining iterative refinement and frequency-aware fusion to improve both perceptual quality and structural fidelity in diffusion-based image super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image super-resolution struggle to balance high-frequency perceptual quality and low-frequency structural fidelity, with current inference-time scaling methods being suboptimal.

Method: IAFS uses iterative refinement to correct structural deviations and adaptive frequency fusion to integrate high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information.

Result: Extensive experiments show IAFS outperforms existing methods, resolving the perception-fidelity conflict and improving perceptual detail and structural accuracy.

Conclusion: IAFS successfully balances perceptual quality and structural fidelity in diffusion-based super-resolution, outperforming prior inference-time scaling techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading paradigm for image super-resolution (SR), but existing methods struggle to guarantee both the high-frequency perceptual quality and the low-frequency structural fidelity of generated images. Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.

TL;DR: AnyMS is a training-free framework for multi-subject customization, balancing text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control using a dual-level attention decoupling mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control while relying on additional training, limiting scalability and efficiency.

Method: AnyMS uses a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism: global decoupling separates textual and visual conditions, while local decoupling confines subject attention to designated areas. Pre-trained image adapters are used for feature extraction.

Result: AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to more subjects without additional training.

Conclusion: AnyMS offers an efficient, scalable solution for multi-subject customization, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-subject customization aims to synthesize multiple user-specified subjects into a coherent image. To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints. However, existing methods still struggle to balance three critical objectives: text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while the reliance on additional training further limits their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathFound is an agentic multimodal model designed to improve pathological diagnosis by enabling evidence-seeking inference, outperforming static models in accuracy and detail detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathological models lack dynamic refinement and targeted evidence acquisition, unlike clinical workflows that iteratively refine diagnoses.

Method: PathFound combines pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement through three stages: initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision.

Result: PathFound consistently improves diagnostic accuracy across large multimodal models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse clinical scenarios, including detecting subtle pathological details.

Conclusion: Evidence-seeking workflows, as demonstrated by PathFound, enhance computational pathology by mirroring clinical diagnostic processes and improving accuracy.

Abstract: Recent pathological foundation models have substantially advanced visual representation learning and multimodal interaction. However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.

*Zongsheng Cao,Yangfan He,Anran Liu,Jun Xie,Feng Chen,Zepeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PurifyGen is a training-free, dual-stage method for safe text-to-image generation by purifying risky prompts through semantic alignment and transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of traditional safety methods (e.g., blacklisting) in diffusion models, which are either circumventable or resource-intensive, PurifyGen aims to provide a safer T2I generation without modifying model weights.

Method: PurifyGen uses complementary semantic distances to classify prompt tokens as risky or safe, followed by dual-space transformation to remove toxic semantics and reinforce clean ones. It selectively replaces risky tokens to minimize disruption.

Result: PurifyGen outperforms existing methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes with training-dependent approaches.

Conclusion: PurifyGen offers a practical, plug-and-play solution for safe T2I generation with strong generalization and minimal disruption to model coherence.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLLMs' comprehension of dense graphical reaction representations in chemistry literature, addressing gaps in autonomous AI chemists.

Method: Introduces RxnBench with SF-QA (fine-grained visual perception) and FD-QA (cross-modal integration tasks) for evaluating MLLMs.

Result: MLLMs excel in text extraction but struggle with chemical logic and structural recognition; reasoning-enhanced models outperform others but still underperform (<50% accuracy on FD-QA).

Conclusion: Domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines are urgently needed to advance AI capabilities in chemistry.

Abstract: The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.

Result: ThinkGen achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple generation benchmarks, demonstrating robust and versatile capabilities.

Conclusion: ThinkGen successfully leverages CoT reasoning for visual generation, offering a flexible and effective solution for diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables systematic solutions to complex understanding tasks. However, its extension to generation tasks remains nascent and limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation. In this work, we present ThinkGen, the first think-driven visual generation framework that explicitly leverages MLLM's CoT reasoning in various generation scenarios. ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and effective image denoising due to the massive daily generation of image data.

Method: Haar-tSVD leverages Haar transform and tensor SVD for global and local correlations, with adaptive noise estimation and deep learning enhancements.

Result: Demonstrated efficiency and effectiveness on various datasets, with code publicly available.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD balances speed and performance, offering a robust solution for image denoising.

Abstract: The proliferation of imaging devices and countless image data generated every day impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image denoising. In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation, and present a computationally simple denoising algorithm. The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship. Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed method for noise removal.

TL;DR: ProGuard is a vision-language model designed to proactively identify and describe out-of-distribution safety risks without model adjustments, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods struggle with multimodal safety risks, prompting the need for proactive solutions like ProGuard.

Method: ProGuard uses reinforcement learning on a modality-balanced dataset (87K samples) to achieve efficient reasoning and introduce OOD safety tasks with similarity rewards.

Result: ProGuard matches closed-source models in binary safety classification, excels in categorization, and improves OOD detection by 52.6% and description by 64.8%.

Conclusion: ProGuard demonstrates superior proactive moderation for multimodal safety risks, addressing gaps left by traditional reactive approaches.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative models has led to a continuous emergence of multimodal safety risks, exposing the limitations of existing defense methods. To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved distillation method for real-time interactive video diffusion, addressing challenges in multimodal conditioning, achieving 20x faster inference with quality comparable to full-step models, and integrating with audio language models for seamless human-AI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable real-time multimodal interactive AI systems by overcoming the inefficiency and unnatural interaction caused by bidirectional attention in existing diffusion models.

Method: The method involves an improved distillation recipe focusing on condition input quality, initialization, and on-policy optimization schedule, integrated with audio language models and long-form video inference techniques.

Result: The distilled model reduces inference cost and latency by 20x while matching visual quality benchmarks. Integrated system LiveTalk outperforms Sora2 and Veo3 in coherence and latency (real-time vs. 1-2 minutes).

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap for real-time multimodal interactive video diffusion, enabling seamless human-AI interaction with high-quality output and reduced latency.

Abstract: Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.

*Damiano Marsili,Aditya Mehta,Ryan Y. Lin,Georgia Gkioxari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TWIN introduces a large-scale dataset and task to enhance fine-grained perceptual abilities in VLMs, improving performance on nuanced recognition tasks by up to 19.3% without sacrificing general VQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack fine-grained visual understanding due to coarse training corpora, missing subtle visual details and exhibiting biases.

Method: TWIN provides 561,000 image-pair queries to train VLMs on nuanced visual cues, spanning diverse objects and contexts. A benchmark suite, FGVQA, evaluates gains.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN improves fine-grained recognition by up to 19.3%, even on unseen domains, while maintaining general VQA performance.

Conclusion: TWIN scales well with annotations and serves as a drop-in addition to VLM corpora, promising advancements in perceptual precision for future models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition ("Is it a cat or a dog?") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/

### [168] [Detection Fire in Camera RGB-NIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23594)
*Nguyen Truong Khai,Luong Duc Vinh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in fire detection using infrared cameras, proposing a two-stage model and Patched-YOLO to improve accuracy and reduce false positives from artificial lights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fire detection models struggle with misclassifying artificial lights as fire and lack sufficient data for training, especially in night-time scenarios.

Method: The authors introduced an NIR dataset, a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0, and Patched-YOLO for RGB images to enhance detection accuracy.

Result: The proposed methods achieve higher accuracy than previous models like YOLOv7, RT-DETR, and YOLOv9, particularly for night-time fire detection.

Conclusion: The contributions—data augmentation, a two-stage model, and Patched-YOLO—significantly improve fire detection accuracy and address limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Improving the accuracy of fire detection using infrared night vision cameras remains a challenging task. Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models. For example, YOLOv7 achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.51 using an input image size of 640 x 1280, RT-DETR reached an mAP50-95 of 0.65 with an image size of 640 x 640, and YOLOv9 obtained an mAP50-95 of 0.598 at the same resolution. Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.
  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection. Third, to improve fire detection in RGB images, especially for small and distant objects, we introduce Patched-YOLO, which enhances the model's detection capability through patch-based processing. Further details of these contributions are discussed in the following sections.

### [169] [Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation Framework with Hybrid Metaheuristic Optimization for Robust Early Pancreatic Neoplasm Detection in Multimodal CT Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23597)
*Janani Annur Thiruvengadam,Kiran Mayee Nabigaru,Anusha Kovi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework for early detection of pancreatic tumors using multimodal imaging data, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of pancreatic neoplasms is challenging due to subtle visual cues and anatomical variations in CT scans, necessitating an effective and scalable system.

Method: The SRFA framework uses MAGRes-UNet for segmentation, DenseNet-121 for feature extraction, HHO-BA metaheuristic for feature selection, and a hybrid ViT-EfficientNet-B3 model for classification, optimized with SSA and GWO.

Result: The model achieved 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score, and 94.83% specificity, outperforming traditional CNNs and transformer-based models.

Conclusion: The SRFA framework shows promise as a robust tool for early pancreatic tumor detection.

Abstract: The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.

*Shu Pu,Boya Zeng,Kaichen Zhou,Mengyu Wang,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to measure memorization in 3D generative models, analyzes factors influencing memorization, and suggests strategies to reduce it without harming output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand if 3D generative models memorize training shapes, addressing concerns like data leakage and improving generation diversity.

Method: An evaluation framework is designed to quantify memorization. Controlled experiments with a latent vector-set diffusion model investigate the impact of data modality, diversity, conditioning, guidance scale, Vecset length, and rotation augmentation.

Result: Memorization varies with data modality and diversity, peaks at moderate guidance scales, and can be reduced with longer Vecsets or rotation augmentation.

Conclusion: The framework and findings offer insights into memorization in 3D generative models, proposing practical ways to minimize it while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used in 3D vision to synthesize novel shapes, yet it remains unclear whether their generation relies on memorizing training shapes. Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

*Xiaoyu Li,Peidong Li,Xian Wu,Long Shi,Dedong Liu,Yitao Wu,Jiajia Fu,Dixiao Cui,Lijun Zhao,Lining Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAT is a spatio-temporal alignment module for autonomous driving that improves 3D detectors and trackers by adaptively decoding alignment proposals from multiple hypotheses without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods simplify motion modeling with unified explicit models, which can be suboptimal due to varying motion states and object features across frames.

Method: HAT uses multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware features, then decodes optimal alignment proposals by combining semantic and motion cues.

Result: HAT achieves state-of-the-art tracking (46.0% AMOTA) and improves perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) while reducing collisions by 32%.

Conclusion: HAT enhances robustness in end-to-end autonomous driving, especially when semantics are corrupted, by improving motion modeling.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.

*Keda Tao,Wenjie Du,Bohan Yu,Weiqiang Wang,Jian Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniAgent introduces active audio-visual reasoning with dynamic tool orchestration, outperforming existing models by 10% - 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current omnimodal LLMs lack fine-grained cross-modal understanding and struggle with alignment.

Method: OmniAgent uses dynamic planning and audio-guided perception to focus on task-relevant cues.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on audio-video benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a shift to active multimodal inquiry, improving accuracy significantly.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often lack the fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.

### [173] [IDT: A Physically Grounded Transformer for Feed-Forward Multi-View Intrinsic Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23667)
*Kang Du,Yirui Guan,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDT is a transformer-based feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition, achieving view-consistent results without iterative sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB images mix material properties, illumination, and view effects, making intrinsic decomposition challenging, especially in multi-view settings.

Method: IDT uses transformer attention to jointly process multiple images, decomposing them into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading based on a physical model.

Result: Experiments show IDT outperforms prior methods in multi-view consistency, producing cleaner reflectance and shading results.

Conclusion: IDT provides interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransPhy3D addresses transparent object perception using video diffusion models trained on synthetic data (11k sequences), achieving SOTA depth/normal estimation and improving robotic grasping success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparent objects challenge perception due to refraction, reflection, and transmission, disrupting traditional depth estimation methods. Video diffusion models, however, implicitly learn optical rules, making them promising for solving this problem.

Method: TransPhy3D is a synthetic corpus of transparent/reflective scenes rendered with Blender/Cycles. A video-to-video translator (DKT) is trained using LoRA adapters on RGB+depth latents, combining TransPhy3D with existing datasets for temporal consistency.

Result: DKT achieves zero-shot SOTA on benchmarks (ClearPose, DREDS, TransPhy3D-Test) with improved accuracy and temporal coherence. A 1.3B version runs efficiently (~0.17s/frame) and enhances robotic grasping success.

Conclusion: Generative video priors can be repurposed for robust, label-free perception of transparent objects, supporting the claim that "Diffusion knows transparency."

Abstract: Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: "Diffusion knows transparency." Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based VSR methods suffer from high latency due to reliance on future frames and multi-step denoising, making them impractical for real-time applications.

Method: The proposed Stream-DiffVSR uses a four-step distilled denoiser, Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module, and Temporal Processor Module (TPM) to enhance efficiency and temporal coherence while operating strictly on past frames.

Result: Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU, outperforming prior methods in perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) and reducing latency by over 130x compared to SOTA TMP.

Conclusion: Stream-DiffVSR is the first diffusion-based VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment, significantly reducing delays from 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods achieve strong perceptual quality but remain impractical for latency-sensitive settings due to reliance on future frames and expensive multi-step denoising. We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

Result: Achieved superior performance in diverse evaluations.

Conclusion: Moxin 7B and its variants contribute to a sustainable open-source ecosystem and advance LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility.

Moxin 7B is introduced as a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework, which moves beyond the simple sharing of model weights to embrace complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation detail, thus fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment that can sustain a healthy open-source ecosystem. To further equip Moxin with various capabilities in different tasks, we develop three variants based on Moxin, including Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, and Moxin-Chinese, which target the vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, respectively. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations. We adopt open-source framework and open data for the training.

TL;DR: Transformer-based sentence embeddings encode hierarchical cognitive structures aligned with human-interpretable attributes, as demonstrated by reliable decoding of annotated energy scores and tier labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether sentence embeddings capture higher-level cognitive organization beyond geometric structure, aligning with human-interpretable psychological attributes.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 480 sentences annotated with energy scores and tier labels, evaluated using linear and nonlinear probes on fixed transformer embeddings.

Result: Continuous scores and tier labels were reliably decoded, with nonlinear probes outperforming linear ones. Qualitative analyses confirmed smooth gradients and adjacent-tier confusions.

Conclusion: Transformer embedding spaces hierarchically organize cognitive attributes, independent of surface word statistics, without implying internal awareness.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that transformer-based language models learn rich geometric structure in their embedding spaces, yet the presence of higher-level cognitive organization within these representations remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether sentence embeddings encode a graded, hierarchical structure aligned with human-interpretable cognitive or psychological attributes. We construct a dataset of 480 natural-language sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels spanning seven ordered cognitive categories. Using fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformer models, we evaluate the recoverability of these annotations via linear and shallow nonlinear probes. Across models, both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable, with shallow nonlinear probes providing consistent performance gains over linear probes. Lexical TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse, indicating that the observed structure is not attributable to surface word statistics alone. Nonparametric permutation tests further confirm that probe performance exceeds chance under label-randomization nulls. Qualitative analyses using UMAP visualizations and confusion matrices reveal smooth low-to-high gradients and predominantly adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space. Taken together, these results provide evidence that transformer embedding spaces exhibit a hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, while remaining agnostic to claims of internal awareness or phenomenology.

TL;DR: SmartSnap introduces proactive self-verification for RL agents, improving scalability and performance by focusing on decisive snapshots instead of verbose trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task verification in RL is passive and costly, relying on noisy trajectory analysis. SmartSnap aims to make verification proactive and efficient.

Method: Develops Self-Verifying Agents that follow 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, Creativity) to generate minimal snapshots for verification by an LLM-as-a-Judge.

Result: Experiments show performance gains of 26.08% and 16.66% for 8B and 30B models, respectively, outperforming some larger models.

Conclusion: SmartSnap enables scalable RL training by combining solution-finding and evidence-seeking, fostering efficient self-verifying agents.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the syntactic structure of qulk-clauses (meaning 'I said') in YIA and contribute to minimalist syntactic theory.

Method: Applies core minimalist operations (Merge, Move, Agree, Spell-out) and post-syntactic processes like Morphological Merger.

Result: Qulk-clauses are biclausal with qulk as a clause-embedding predicate. Accounts for dialect-specific features.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical insights for minimalism and raises questions about extending the analysis to other clauses like 'you said'.

Abstract: This study investigates the syntax of qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic (YIA) within the Minimalist Program. The construction qulk-clause, a morphologically fused form meaning 'I said,' introduces embedded declarative interrogative, and imperative clauses, often eithout complementizer. The central proposal of this paper is that qulk-clauses are biclausal structures in which qulk functions a clause-embedding predicate sec;ecting a dull CP complement. By applying core minimalist operations, viz., Merge, Move, Agree, and Spell-out, the study provides a layered syntactic analysis of qulk-clauses, for illustrating how their derivation proceeds through standard computational steps and post-syntactic processes such as Morphological Merger. The proposal also accounts for dialect-specific features like bipartite negation, cliticization, and CP embedding. The findings offer theoretical contributions to generative syntax, specifically minimalism. The study concludes raising theoretical questions concerning extending the analysis to the addressee-clause kil-k 'you said'. It also provides insights into the possibility of the universality of minimalism.

TL;DR: FAA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for large language models using frequency-aware modulation via random Fourier features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable selective emphasis on informative frequency bands during adaptation while preserving backbone representational capacity.

Method: Incorporates random Fourier features into lightweight adapter modules for frequency-aware modulation.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance on benchmarks like GLUE and E2E NLG with low overhead.

Conclusion: FAA is a robust and efficient approach for post-training large language models.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework, termed Fourier-Activated Adapter (FAA), for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained language models. By incorporating random Fourier features into lightweight adapter modules, FAA decomposes intermediate representations into complementary low- and high-frequency components, enabling frequency-aware modulation of semantic information. This design allows the model to selectively emphasize informative frequency bands during adaptation while preserving the representational capacity of the frozen backbone. Extensive experiments on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FAA consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while maintaining low computational and memory overhead.

### [181] [LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection for Few-Shot Wearable-Sensor Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22385)
*Elsen Ronando,Sozo Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework for Human Activity Recognition, combining semantic reasoning with structural cues to select informative exemplars, achieving superior performance in few-shot conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HAR methods rely heavily on large labeled datasets and geometric exemplar selection, which struggle to distinguish similar wearable-sensor activities.

Method: Incorporates LLM-generated knowledge priors (feature importance, inter-class confusability, exemplar budget multipliers) with margin-based validation, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization.

Result: Achieves 88.78% macro F1-score on UCI-HAR dataset under few-shot conditions, outperforming random sampling, herding, and $k$-center methods.

Conclusion: LLM-derived semantic priors, combined with structural cues, enhance exemplar selection for few-shot HAR.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework to address a key limitation in state-of-the-art Human Activity Recognition (HAR) methods: their reliance on large labeled datasets and purely geometric exemplar selection, which often fail to distinguish similar weara-ble sensor activities such as walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.

### [182] [Hallucination Detection and Evaluation of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22416)
*Chenggong Zhang,Haopeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes HHEM, a lightweight model for detecting hallucinations in LLMs, reducing evaluation time significantly while maintaining accuracy. It highlights challenges in summarization tasks and suggests improvements like segment-based retrieval. Larger models show fewer hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs produce unreliable content, but current detection methods like KnowHalu are computationally expensive. The study aims to develop a more efficient solution.

Method: The Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM) is introduced, a classification-based framework independent of LLM judgments. It evaluates hallucination detection via TPR, TNR, and accuracy on QA and summarization tasks, with additional segment-based retrieval for localized hallucinations.

Result: HHEM cuts evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes and achieves 82.2% accuracy. Larger models (7B-9B) hallucinate less, while intermediate models are unstable. Segment-based retrieval improves summarization task performance.

Conclusion: Structured frameworks like HHEM balance efficiency and accuracy in hallucination detection. Future work should focus on improving localized hallucination detection and validating content robustness.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a significant challenge, generating misleading or unverifiable content that undermines trust and reliability. Existing evaluation methods, such as KnowHalu, employ multi-stage verification but suffer from high computational costs. To address this, we integrate the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. We conduct a comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and Accuracy on question-answering (QA) and summarization tasks. Our results show that HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, while HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves the highest accuracy \(82.2\%\) and TPR \(78.9\%\). However, HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks. To address this, we introduce segment-based retrieval, improving detection by verifying smaller text components. Additionally, our cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis indicates that larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally exhibit fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models show higher instability. These findings highlight the need for structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency with robust factual validation, enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated content.

TL;DR: HiFi-RAG improves open-domain RAG by using hierarchical filtering and cost-efficient Gemini models, outperforming baselines in metrics like ROUGE-L and DeBERTaScore.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in RAG include irrelevant retrieved info and misaligned answers; HiFi-RAG aims to address these.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline with Gemini 2.5 Flash for filtering and Pro for final answer generation.

Result: Outperformed baselines: +19.6% ROUGE-L, +6.2% DeBERTaScore on validation; +57.4% ROUGE-L, +14.9% DeBERTaScore on Test2025.

Conclusion: HiFi-RAG successfully enhances RAG performance via hierarchical filtering and efficient model usage.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in open-domain settings faces significant challenges regarding irrelevant information in retrieved documents and the alignment of generated answers with user intent. We present HiFi-RAG (Hierarchical Filtering RAG), the winning closed-source system in the Text-to-Text static evaluation of the MMU-RAGent NeurIPS 2025 Competition. Our approach moves beyond standard embedding-based retrieval via a multi-stage pipeline. We leverage the speed and cost-efficiency of Gemini 2.5 Flash (4-6x cheaper than Pro) for query formulation, hierarchical content filtering, and citation attribution, while reserving the reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro for final answer generation. On the MMU-RAGent validation set, our system outperformed the baseline, improving ROUGE-L to 0.274 (+19.6%) and DeBERTaScore to 0.677 (+6.2%). On Test2025, our custom dataset evaluating questions that require post-cutoff knowledge (post January 2025), HiFi-RAG outperforms the parametric baseline by 57.4% in ROUGE-L and 14.9% in DeBERTaScore.

*Jie Zhou,Xin Chen,Jie Zhang,Zhe Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores integrating LLMs like GLM-series and GPT-4 into accounting by evaluating their reasoning capabilities, identifying GPT-4 as top performer but noting gaps for real-world enterprise use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of integrating LLMs into accounting by assessing their domain-specific reasoning abilities for digital transformation.

Method: Introduces vertical-domain accounting reasoning evaluation criteria, tests models (GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, GPT-4) with accounting tasks using varied prompt strategies.

Result: GPT-4 excels in accounting reasoning; prompt engineering improves performance, but models still lag behind practical enterprise needs.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in accounting but require further optimization for enterprise-level deployment to unlock their full potential.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping learning paradigms, cognitive processes, and research methodologies across a wide range of domains. Integrating LLMs with professional fields and redefining the relationship between LLMs and domain-specific applications has become a critical challenge for promoting enterprise digital transformation and broader social development. To effectively integrate LLMs into the accounting domain, it is essential to understand their domain-specific reasoning capabilities. This study introduces the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing the training data characteristics of representative GLM-series models. These criteria provide a foundation for subsequent research on reasoning paradigms and offer benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance. Based on this framework, we evaluate several representative models, including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4, on a set of accounting reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that different prompt engineering strategies lead to varying degrees of performance improvement across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements. In particular, further optimization is needed for deployment in enterprise-level accounting scenarios to fully realize the potential value of LLMs in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Information-seeking (IS) agents have achieved strong performance across a range of wide and deep search tasks, yet their tool use remains largely restricted to API-level snippet retrieval and URL-based page fetching, limiting access to the richer information available through real browsing. While full browser interaction could unlock deeper capabilities, its fine-grained control and verbose page content returns introduce substantial complexity for ReAct-style function-calling agents. To bridge this gap, we propose Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), which introduces a minimal and complete browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration through a nested structure. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition. Empirical results on challenging deep IS benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear benefits in practice. Further in-depth analyses underscore its efficiency and flexibility.

*Jungyeul Park,Chulwoo Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper advocates for eojeol-based constituency representation in Korean treebanks, separating morphology and POS details into non-constituent layers, and shows equivalence between Sejong and Penn treebanks under normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the representational conflict in Korean treebanks where morpheme-based terminals confuse word-internal morphology with syntactic structure, and to align with dependency resources.

Method: Proposes eojeol-based constituency with morphological segmentation and POS info in a separate layer; compares Sejong and Penn treebanks under normalization.

Result: Demonstrates representational equivalence between Sejong and Penn treebanks at the eojeol-based constituency level.

Conclusion: An eojeol-based annotation scheme maintains interpretable constituency, enables cross-treebank comparison, and supports constituency-dependency conversion.

Abstract: The design of Korean constituency treebanks raises a fundamental representational question concerning the choice of terminal units. Although Korean words are morphologically complex, treating morphemes as constituency terminals conflates word internal morphology with phrase level syntactic structure and creates mismatches with eojeol based dependency resources. This paper argues for an eojeol based constituency representation, with morphological segmentation and fine grained part of speech information encoded in a separate, non constituent layer. A comparative analysis shows that, under explicit normalization assumptions, the Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at the eojeol based constituency level. Building on this result, we outline an eojeol based annotation scheme that preserves interpretable constituency and supports cross treebank comparison and constituency dependency conversion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ManchuTTS is a novel speech synthesis method tailored for the endangered Manchu language, addressing data scarcity and agglutination via hierarchical text representation and cross-modal attention. It achieves high quality with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of synthesizing speech for Manchu, an endangered language with data scarcity and phonological agglutination, requiring innovative solutions.

Method: The method uses a three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) and cross-modal hierarchical attention. It integrates deep convolutional networks with a flow-matching Transformer and employs hierarchical contrastive loss and data augmentation.

Result: ManchuTTS achieves a MOS of 4.52 with a 5.2-hour dataset, surpassing baselines. Hierarchical guidance improves pronunciation accuracy by 31% and prosodic naturalness by 27%.

Conclusion: ManchuTTS effectively tackles Manchu's unique challenges, demonstrating superior performance and potential for low-resource language synthesis.

Abstract: As an endangered language, Manchu presents unique challenges for speech synthesis, including severe data scarcity and strong phonological agglutination. This paper proposes ManchuTTS(Manchu Text to Speech), a novel approach tailored to Manchu's linguistic characteristics. To handle agglutination, this method designs a three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) and a cross-modal hierarchical attention mechanism for multi-granular alignment. The synthesis model integrates deep convolutional networks with a flow-matching Transformer, enabling efficient, non-autoregressive generation. This method further introduce a hierarchical contrastive loss to guide structured acoustic-linguistic correspondence. To address low-resource constraints, This method construct the first Manchu TTS dataset and employ a data augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that ManchuTTS attains a MOS of 4.52 using a 5.2-hour training subset derived from our full 6.24-hour annotated corpus, outperforming all baseline models by a notable margin. Ablations confirm hierarchical guidance improves agglutinative word pronunciation accuracy (AWPA) by 31% and prosodic naturalness by 27%.

### [188] [Learning When Not to Attend Globally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22562)
*Xuan Luo,Kailai Zhang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can dynamically decide when to use global context with All-or-Here Attention (AHA), replacing most full attention operations with local sliding window attention without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mimic human reading behavior by enabling LLMs to toggle between global and local context dynamically, reducing redundant full attention operations.

Method: Propose AHA, which uses a binary router per attention head to switch between full attention and local sliding window attention (256 tokens) for each token.

Result: Up to 93% of full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss; global attention necessity decays rapidly with larger windows.

Conclusion: Full attention is largely redundant; efficient inference requires only on-demand global context access, as demonstrated by AHA.

Abstract: When reading books, humans focus primarily on the current page, flipping back to recap prior context only when necessary. Similarly, we demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn to dynamically determine when to attend to global context. We propose All-or-Here Attention (AHA), which utilizes a binary router per attention head to dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token. Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands. By decoupling local processing from global access, AHA reveals that full attention is largely redundant, and that efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a structured approach using LLMs for multimodal sentiment analysis, achieving notable results in extracting sentiment sextuples and detecting sentiment shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of multimodal sentiment analysis and improve AI's emotional intelligence by tackling two subtasks: extracting sentiment sextuples and detecting sentiment flipping.

Method: For Subtask-I, a structured prompting pipeline guided LLMs to extract sentiment components sequentially. For Subtask-II, three LLMs were ensembled to detect sentiment transitions.

Result: Achieved a 47.38% average score on Subtask-I and a 74.12% exact match F1 on Subtask-II.

Conclusion: Step-wise refinement and ensemble strategies are effective for rich, multimodal sentiment analysis tasks.

Abstract: Understanding sentiment in multimodal conversations is a complex yet crucial challenge toward building emotionally intelligent AI systems. The Multimodal Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (MCABSA) Challenge invited participants to tackle two demanding subtasks: (1) extracting a comprehensive sentiment sextuple, including holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment, and rationale from multi-speaker dialogues, and (2) detecting sentiment flipping, which detects dynamic sentiment shifts and their underlying triggers. For Subtask-I, in the present paper, we designed a structured prompting pipeline that guided large language models (LLMs) to sequentially extract sentiment components with refined contextual understanding. For Subtask-II, we further leveraged the complementary strengths of three LLMs through ensembling to robustly identify sentiment transitions and their triggers. Our system achieved a 47.38% average score on Subtask-I and a 74.12% exact match F1 on Subtask-II, showing the effectiveness of step-wise refinement and ensemble strategies in rich, multimodal sentiment analysis tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: T3LLM is a framework using three LLMs (worker, reviewer, student) for multi-step reasoning and correction in time series question answering, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches often make reasoning errors with numerical sequences; T3LLM leverages verifiability of time series data for consistency checking and correction.

Method: T3LLM employs a worker LLM for generating reasoning steps, a reviewer LLM for identifying errors, and a student LLM fine-tuned with corrected reasoning.

Result: T3LLM outperforms strong LLM-based baselines on real-world TSQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed T3LLM framework effectively integrates multi-step reasoning and self-correction, enhancing performance in time series question answering.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), diverse time series analysis tasks are reformulated as time series question answering (TSQA) through a unified natural language interface. However, existing LLM-based approaches largely adopt general natural language processing techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences. Different from purely textual tasks, time series data are inherently verifiable, enabling consistency checking between reasoning steps and the original input. Motivated by this property, we propose T3LLM, which performs multi-step reasoning with an explicit correction mechanism for time series question answering. The T3LLM framework consists of three LLMs, namely, a worker, a reviewer, and a student, that are responsible for generation, review, and reasoning learning, respectively. Within this framework, the worker generates step-wise chains of thought (CoT) under structured prompts, while the reviewer inspects the reasoning, identifies erroneous steps, and provides corrective comments. The collaboratively generated corrected CoT are used to fine-tune the student model, internalizing multi-step reasoning and self-correction into its parameters. Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks demonstrate that T3LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong LLM-based baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M2G-Eval is a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code generation in LLMs across four levels (Class, Function, Block, Line) and 18 languages, revealing fine-grained capability variations and transferable programming concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating code generation in LLMs are limited by single-granularity assessments and few languages, missing fine-grained variations and multilingual scenarios.

Method: M2G-Eval evaluates LLMs at four structural granularities (Class, Function, Block, Line) across 18 languages, using 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 test instances. It also introduces M2G-Eval-Coder models trained with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Evaluation of 30 models shows: (1) Line-level tasks are easiest, Class-level hardest; (2) performance gaps widen between full- and partial-granularity languages as complexity increases; (3) strong cross-language correlations indicate transferable programming concepts.

Conclusion: M2G-Eval provides fine-grained diagnosis of LLM code generation capabilities, highlighting challenges in synthesizing complex code and demonstrating cross-language transferability.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of code large language models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in systematically evaluating their code generation capabilities, yet existing benchmarks predominantly assess models at a single structural granularity and focus on limited programming languages, obscuring fine-grained capability variations across different code scopes and multilingual scenarios. We introduce M2G-Eval, a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code generation in large language models (LLMs) across four levels: Class, Function, Block, and Line. Spanning 18 programming languages, M2G-Eval includes 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated, contamination-controlled test instances. We develop M2G-Eval-Coder models by training Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. Evaluating 30 models (28 state-of-the-art LLMs plus our two M2G-Eval-Coder variants) reveals three main findings: (1) an apparent difficulty hierarchy, with Line-level tasks easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages as task complexity increases; and (3) strong cross-language correlations, suggesting that models learn transferable programming concepts. M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores diffusion models for language generation, highlighting challenges due to text's discrete nature. It categorizes existing approaches and identifies trade-offs, noting issues like uniform corruption and token-wise marginal training. Future work should align diffusion processes with text structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have appealing properties for language generation (e.g., parallel decoding), but their direct application to text is challenging due to its discrete and structured nature. The paper aims to bridge this gap by analyzing diffusion mechanics in language modeling.

Method: The paper categorizes existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. It evaluates these against five essential properties and analyzes their trade-offs, focusing on large diffusion language models.

Result: The analysis reveals two key issues: uniform corruption ignores information distribution across positions, and token-wise marginal training fails to capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding.

Conclusion: Future research should develop diffusion processes better aligned with text structure to address these limitations and improve coherence in diffusion language models.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer appealing properties for language generation, such as parallel decoding and iterative refinement, but the discrete and highly structured nature of text challenges the direct application of diffusion principles. In this paper, we revisit diffusion language modeling from the view of diffusion process and language modeling, and outline five properties that separate diffusion mechanics from language-specific requirements. We first categorize existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. We then show that each satisfies only part of the five essential properties and therefore reflects a structural trade-off. Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding. These observations motivate diffusion processes that align more closely with the structure of text, and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models.

### [193] [Evaluating GRPO and DPO for Faithful Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22631)
*Hadi Mohammadi,Tamas Kozak,Anastasia Giachanou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improves LLM problem-solving but often lacks faithfulness, as models may produce misleading explanations. GRPO outperforms DPO in enhancing CoT faithfulness, especially in larger models like Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of CoT explanations in LLMs, which can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers.

Method: Evaluated two optimization methods (GRPO and DPO) for improving CoT faithfulness, using models of varying sizes.

Result: GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct performing best. GRPO shows better potential for improving faithfulness but is less stable in smaller models.

Conclusion: GRPO is a promising method for enhancing transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers without acknowledging external cues. Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics. Both approaches exhibit positive correlations between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics, albeit with less stable behavior at smaller scales. These results suggest that GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP) to improve uncertainty quantification in large language models, reducing prediction set sizes while maintaining coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax probabilities in LLMs are poorly calibrated, necessitating better uncertainty quantification for high-stakes applications.

Method: Proposes VACP, leveraging semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce prediction space while ensuring coverage.

Result: VACP reduces mean prediction set size from 847 to 4.3 tokens (197x improvement) while achieving 89.7% empirical coverage.

Conclusion: VACP offers a practical solution for efficient uncertainty quantification in LLMs with large vocabularies.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains requires rigorous uncertainty quantification, yet standard softmax probabilities are often poorly calibrated. We present a systematic study of Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) applied to next-token prediction in transformer-based models with large vocabularies (greater than 250,000 tokens). Our central contribution is the identification of a coverage-efficiency tradeoff: while naive conformal prediction achieves valid coverage, it produces prediction sets of hundreds of tokens, rendering them uninformative. We propose Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that leverages semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Experiments on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks demonstrate that VACP achieves 89.7 percent empirical coverage (90 percent target) while reducing the mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens -- a 197x improvement in efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis of vocabulary reduction and release our implementation for reproducibility.

TL;DR: A multilingual framework for hope speech detection focuses on Urdu, using pretrained transformer models to achieve high F1-scores, demonstrating effectiveness in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hope speech is underrepresented in NLP, especially for low-resource languages like Urdu. Current tools for positive online communication are limited.

Method: Pretrained transformer models (XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, UrduBERT) are applied with simple preprocessing to train classifiers for hope speech detection.

Result: Achieved F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with strong results in Spanish, German, and English.

Conclusion: Existing multilingual models can effectively detect hope speech in low-resource languages, fostering constructive digital discourse.

Abstract: Hope speech has been relatively underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current studies are largely focused on English, which has resulted in a lack of resources for low-resource languages such as Urdu. As a result, the creation of tools that facilitate positive online communication remains limited. Although transformer-based architectures have proven to be effective in detecting hate and offensive speech, little has been done to apply them to hope speech or, more generally, to test them across a variety of linguistic settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English. These results highlight the possibility of implementing existing multilingual models in low-resource environments, thus making it easier to identify hope speech and helping to build a more constructive digital discourse.

TL;DR: Examining reasoning quality across languages reveals gaps in LLMs' logical support for conclusions, especially in non-Latin scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs' reasoning traces logically support conclusions across languages, highlighting gaps in multilingual evaluation.

Method: Analyzed 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions in 6 languages, using human-validated frameworks and error taxonomy.

Result: Models show high task accuracy but reasoning often fails to support conclusions, especially in non-Latin scripts (twice the misalignment).

Conclusion: Current multilingual evaluation overlooks reasoning flaws, necessitating reasoning-aware frameworks for accurate capability assessment.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought prompting, but whether this reasoning quality transfers across languages remains underexplored. We introduce a human-validated framework to evaluate whether model-generated reasoning traces logically support their conclusions across languages. Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least twice as much misalignment between their reasoning and conclusions than those in Latin scripts. We develop an error taxonomy through human annotation to characterize these failures, finding they stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps. Our findings demonstrate that current multilingual evaluation practices provide an incomplete picture of model reasoning capabilities and highlight the need for reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks.

*Sashank Chapala,Maksym Mironov,Songgaojun Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates minimal, psychologically grounded prompt wording to mitigate Social Desirability Bias (SDB) in LLM-based sampling, finding reformulated prompts most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the divergence of LLM responses from real human data due to Social Desirability Bias (SDB) in socially sensitive questions.

Method: Conducted a study using ANES data on LLMs (Llama-3.1 and GPT-4.1-mini), testing four prompt-based mitigation methods: reformulated, reverse-coded, priming, and preamble.

Result: Reformulated prompts improved alignment with ANES data by reducing bias; reverse-coding had mixed results; priming and preamble showed no systematic benefit.

Conclusion: Prompt-based framing controls can mitigate SDB in LLMs, offering a practical approach for more representative silicon samples.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate population responses, a method known as ``Silicon Sampling''. However, responses to socially sensitive questions frequently exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB), diverging from real human data toward socially acceptable answers. Existing studies on social desirability bias in LLM-based sampling remain limited. In this work, we investigate whether minimal, psychologically grounded prompt wording can mitigate this bias and improve alignment between silicon and human samples. We conducted a study using data from the American National Election Study (ANES) on three LLMs from two model families: the open-source Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini. We first replicate a baseline silicon sampling study, confirming the persistent Social Desirability Bias. We then test four prompt-based mitigation methods: \emph{reformulated} (neutral, third-person phrasing), \emph{reverse-coded} (semantic inversion), and two meta-instructions, \emph{priming} and \emph{preamble}, respectively encouraging analytics and sincerity. Alignment with ANES is evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results demonstrate that reformulated prompts most effectively improve alignment by reducing distribution concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results across eligible items, while the Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity and showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation. Our findings validate the efficacy of prompt-based framing controls in mitigating inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical path toward more representative silicon samples.

### [198] [Data Augmentation for Classification of Negative Pregnancy Outcomes in Imbalanced Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22732)
*Md Badsha Biswas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using social media data (e.g., Twitter) to study negative pregnancy outcomes, addressing dataset gaps with NLP techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infant mortality and birth defects are major concerns; current datasets lack comprehensiveness for studying pregnancy outcomes.

Method: An NLP pipeline processes social media data to classify pregnancy experiences (positive/negative outcomes) and assess causal impacts of interventions.

Result: The study demonstrates social media data's potential as a supplementary resource for epidemiological research on pregnancy outcomes.

Conclusion: Social media data can enhance traditional datasets, offering new insights into pregnancy outcomes and intervention impacts.

Abstract: Infant mortality remains a significant public health concern in the United States, with birth defects identified as a leading cause. Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups. In a broader context, our research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes.

### [199] [WeDLM: Reconciling Diffusion Language Models with Standard Causal Attention for Fast Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22737)
*Aiwei Liu,Minghua He,Shaoxun Zeng,Sijun Zhang,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Wei Jia,Yuan Liu,Xiao Zhou,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TL;DR: WeDLM is a diffusion decoding framework using causal attention for parallel generation, achieving speedups over autoregressive models while preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the parallelism limitations of autoregressive (AR) generation in LLMs and the inefficiencies of bidirectional attention in Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs).

Method: WeDLM uses Topological Reordering and causal attention to enable prefix-cache friendly parallel generation, with a streaming decoding procedure.

Result: WeDLM achieves up to 3x speedup on reasoning tasks and up to 10x in low-entropy scenarios, outperforming optimized AR engines.

Conclusion: Diffusion-style decoding with causal attention can outperform optimized AR engines in practice while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) generation is the standard decoding paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), but its token-by-token nature limits parallelism at inference time. Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.

*Dongning Rao,Yunbiao Zeng,Zhihua Jiang,Jujian Lv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TEXT, a model enhancing Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) with explanations and temporal alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored potential of explanations and temporal alignments in MSA.

Method: Uses Multi-modal Large Language Models for explanations, aligns audio and video with a temporality-oriented neural network, and employs a text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts.

Result: TEXT achieves top performance across four datasets, reducing mean absolute error by 13.5% on CH-SIMS.

Conclusion: TEXT effectively integrates explanations and temporal alignment for superior MSA performance.

Abstract: Human-interaction-involved applications underscore the need for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). Although many approaches have been proposed to address the subtle emotions in different modalities, the power of explanations and temporal alignments is still underexplored. Thus, this paper proposes the Text-routed sparse mixture-of-Experts model with eXplanation and Temporal alignment for MSA (TEXT). TEXT first augments explanations for MSA via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM), and then novelly aligns the epresentations of audio and video through a temporality-oriented neural network block. TEXT aligns different modalities with explanations and facilitates a new text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion. Our temporal alignment block merges the benefits of Mamba and temporal cross-attention. As a result, TEXT achieves the best performance cross four datasets among all tested models, including three recently proposed approaches and three MLLMs. TEXT wins on at least four metrics out of all six metrics. For example, TEXT decreases the mean absolute error to 0.353 on the CH-SIMS dataset, which signifies a 13.5% decrement compared with recently proposed approaches.

*Muhammad Zain Ali,Bernhard Pfahringer,Tony Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain adaptation before fine-tuning improves fake news detection in Urdu for XLM-RoBERTa but shows mixed results for mBERT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited attention to misinformation detection in low-resource languages like Urdu necessitates effective methods leveraging multilingual pretrained models.

Method: Employ staged training with domain-adaptive pretraining using Urdu news corpus before fine-tuning XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT for fake news classification.

Result: Domain-adapted XLM-RoBERTa outperforms its vanilla version; mBERT shows inconsistent gains.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation enhances performance for certain multilingual models in low-resource settings, highlighting its potential.

Abstract: Misinformation on social media is a widely acknowledged issue, and researchers worldwide are actively engaged in its detection. However, low-resource languages such as Urdu have received limited attention in this domain. An obvious approach is to utilize a multilingual pretrained language model and fine-tune it for a downstream classification task, such as misinformation detection. However, these models struggle with domain-specific terms, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of domain adaptation before fine-tuning for fake news classification in Urdu, employing a staged training approach to optimize model generalization. We evaluate two widely used multilingual models, XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT, and apply domain-adaptive pretraining using a publicly available Urdu news corpus. Experiments on four publicly available Urdu fake news datasets show that domain-adapted XLM-R consistently outperforms its vanilla counterpart, while domain-adapted mBERT exhibits mixed results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates rule-based baselines, domain-specific transformers, and large language models for segmenting clinical notes, finding API-based models like GPT-5-mini perform best (72.4 F1). Lightweight baselines work well for structured tasks but struggle with unstructured text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes are often unstructured, complicating secondary analysis. Reliable section identification is crucial for structuring them and enabling downstream applications.

Method: Evaluated rule-based baselines, domain-specific transformers, and large language models (e.g., GPT-5-mini) on a curated dataset of 1,000 MIMIC-IV notes.

Result: Large API-based models (GPT-5-mini) achieved the best average F1 (72.4). Lightweight baselines were competitive for structured tasks but performed poorly on unstructured text.

Conclusion: The results guide method selection for clinical note segmentation and support downstream tasks like information extraction and summarization.

Abstract: Clinical notes are often stored in unstructured or semi-structured formats after extraction from electronic medical record (EMR) systems, which complicates their use for secondary analysis and downstream clinical applications. Reliable identification of section boundaries is a key step toward structuring these notes, as sections such as history of present illness, medications, and discharge instructions each provide distinct clinical contexts. In this work, we evaluate rule-based baselines, domain-specific transformer models, and large language models for clinical note segmentation using a curated dataset of 1,000 notes from MIMIC-IV. Our experiments show that large API-based models achieve the best overall performance, with GPT-5-mini reaching a best average F1 of 72.4 across sentence-level and freetext segmentation. Lightweight baselines remain competitive on structured sentence-level tasks but falter on unstructured freetext. Our results provide guidance for method selection and lay the groundwork for downstream tasks such as information extraction, cohort identification, and automated summarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of semi-automated environment synthesis and unstable simulated users in RL for language-based agents.

Method: Introduces a unified pipeline for automated environment synthesis and an environment-level RL algorithm mitigating user instability.

Result: Validated effectiveness on benchmarks (tau-bench, tau2-Bench, VitaBench) and demonstrated out-of-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The method enhances training stability and efficiency while broadening applicability.

Abstract: Conducting reinforcement learning (RL) in simulated environments offers a cost-effective and highly scalable way to enhance language-based agents. However, previous work has been limited to semi-automated environment synthesis or tasks lacking sufficient difficulty, offering little breadth or depth. In addition, the instability of simulated users integrated into these environments, along with the heterogeneity across simulated environments, poses further challenges for agentic RL. In this work, we propose: (1) a unified pipeline for automated and scalable synthesis of simulated environments associated with high-difficulty but easily verifiable tasks; and (2) an environment level RL algorithm that not only effectively mitigates user instability but also performs advantage estimation at the environment level, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. Comprehensive evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and VitaBench, validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further in-depth analyses underscore its out-of-domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by refining the pre-training objective to balance diversity and precision, improving RL exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve RL's effectiveness in LLMs by understanding how pre-trained token distributions shape the exploration space for RL.

Method: Introduces a generalized pre-training objective using RL principles, balancing diversity and precision through reward-shaping with a scaling factor and rank-aware mechanism.

Result: Precision-oriented priors create better RL exploration spaces than high-entropy distributions, enhancing reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Refining pre-training objectives with precision-focused rewards optimizes RL exploration, boosting LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.

*Mengdi Chai,Ali R. Zomorrodi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates three LLMs (ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, LIama 3.3 70B) in clinical decision support, revealing task-specific variability and mixed effects of prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the practical utility of LLMs in real-world clinical decision-making, focusing on performance variability and the potential of prompt engineering.

Method: Evaluated three LLMs across five clinical tasks using 36 case studies under different temperature settings and applied MedPrompt-based prompt engineering techniques.

Result: LLMs showed high task-specific variability; prompt engineering improved performance in low-accuracy tasks but was counterproductive elsewhere. Targeted few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering's impact is model- and task-dependent, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies to integrate LLMs into healthcare.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in medical knowledge assessments, yet their practical utility in real-world clinical decision-making remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs-ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B-in clinical decision support across the entire clinical reasoning workflow of a typical patient encounter. Using 36 case studies, we first assessed LLM's out-of-the-box performance across five key sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings (default vs. zero): differential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. All models showed high variability by task, achieving near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in relevant diagnostic testing, and moderate performance in remaining tasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT performed better under the zero temperature, whereas LIama showed stronger performance under the default temperature. Next, we assessed whether prompt engineering could enhance LLM performance by applying variations of the MedPrompt framework, incorporating targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that prompt engineering is not a one-size-fit-all solution. While it significantly improved the performance on the task with lowest baseline accuracy (relevant diagnostic testing), it was counterproductive for others. Another key finding was that the targeted dynamic few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection, indicating that the presumed benefits of closely matched examples may be counterbalanced by loss of broader contextual diversity. These findings suggest that the impact of prompt engineering is highly model and task-dependent, highlighting the need for tailored, context-aware strategies for integrating LLMs into healthcare.

*Tao Yu,Yongqi An,Kuan Zhu,Guibo Zhu,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FANG is a post-training pruning framework for LLMs that addresses calibration bias by grouping and pruning neurons based on their functional roles, achieving better performance-sparsity trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods for LLMs suffer from limited generalization due to inadequate calibration sets. FANG aims to preserve functionally critical neurons and improve downstream accuracy.

Method: FANG groups neurons by semantic function, weights tokens correlating with these functions during importance estimation, and adaptively allocates sparsity based on functional complexity.

Result: FANG improves downstream accuracy while maintaining language modeling performance, outperforming FLAP and OBC by 1.5%--8.5% under 30% and 40% sparsity.

Conclusion: FANG sets a new SOTA by effectively pruning LLMs while preserving critical functional neurons, offering a robust solution for post-training structured pruning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance across natural language tasks but incur substantial computational and storage costs due to their scale. Post-training structured pruning offers an efficient solution. However, when few-shot calibration sets fail to adequately reflect the pretraining data distribution, existing methods exhibit limited generalization to downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework that alleviates calibration bias by identifying and preserving neurons critical to specific function. FANG groups neurons with similar function based on the type of semantic context they process and prunes each group independently. During importance estimation within each group, tokens that strongly correlate with the functional role of the neuron group are given higher weighting. Additionally, FANG also preserves neurons that contribute across multiple context types. To achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance, it allocates sparsity to each block adaptively based on its functional complexity. Experiments show that FANG improves downstream accuracy while preserving language modeling performance. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results when combined with FLAP and OBC, two representative pruning methods. Specifically, FANG outperforms FLAP and OBC by 1.5%--8.5% in average accuracy under 30% and 40% sparsity.

TL;DR: LENS aligns multimodal sensing data with language models to generate clinically meaningful mental-health narratives, outperforming baselines in NLP metrics and symptom-severity accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translate numerical health-sensing data into natural language, addressing challenges with LLMs' inability to process long sensor streams and scarcity of paired sensor-text datasets.

Method: Constructs a dataset from EMA responses, creates sensor-text QA pairs, and trains a patch-level encoder to integrate sensor signals into LLM representation space.

Result: LENS outperforms baselines in NLP metrics and symptom-severity accuracy, with user studies confirming its narratives are clinically meaningful.

Conclusion: LENS advances LLMs for health sensing, enabling scalable reasoning over raw behavioral signals to support clinical decisions.

Abstract: Multimodal health sensing offers rich behavioral signals for assessing mental health, yet translating these numerical time-series measurements into natural language remains challenging. Current LLMs cannot natively ingest long-duration sensor streams, and paired sensor-text datasets are scarce. To address these challenges, we introduce LENS, a framework that aligns multimodal sensing data with language models to generate clinically grounded mental-health narratives. LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space. Our results show that LENS outperforms strong baselines on standard NLP metrics and task-specific measures of symptom-severity accuracy. A user study with 13 mental-health professionals further indicates that LENS-produced narratives are comprehensive and clinically meaningful. Ultimately, our approach advances LLMs as interfaces for health sensing, providing a scalable path toward models that can reason over raw behavioral signals and support downstream clinical decision-making.

*Kerem Zaman,Shashank Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques Biasing Features for mislabeling CoT as unfaithful due to incompleteness rather than unfaithfulness, introduces faithful@k to show token budgets improve hint verbalization, and advocates diverse interpretability metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the confusion between unfaithfulness and incompleteness in CoT evaluations, highlighting the limitations of Biasing Features and proposing alternative metrics.

Method: They use multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, introduce the faithful@k metric, and employ Causal Mediation Analysis to study non-verbalized hints.

Result: Many CoTs labeled unfaithful by Biasing Features were found faithful by other metrics. Larger token budgets increased hint verbalization (up to 90%). Non-verbalized hints still causally influenced predictions.

Conclusion: The authors caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and recommend incorporating diverse tools like causal mediation and corruption-based metrics for better interpretability.

Abstract: Recent work, using the Biasing Features metric, labels a CoT as unfaithful if it omits a prompt-injected hint that affected the prediction. We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics.

TL;DR: Prompt Choreography is a framework for efficient execution of LLM workflows using a dynamic KV cache, reducing latency and speeding up workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in multi-agent LLM workflows by reducing redundant computations and improving latency.

Method: Introduces Prompt Choreography with a dynamic KV cache allowing reordered subsets of messages and parallel calls, fine-tuning LLMs for cache compatibility.

Result: Achieves 2.0--6.2x faster time-to-first-token and >2.2x end-to-end speedups in some workflows.

Conclusion: Prompt Choreography effectively optimizes LLM workflows by leveraging cached encodings and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent workflows. We introduce Prompt Choreography, a framework that efficiently executes LLM workflows by maintaining a dynamic, global KV cache. Each LLM call can attend to an arbitrary, reordered subset of previously encoded messages. Parallel calls are supported. Though caching messages' encodings sometimes gives different results from re-encoding them in a new context, we show in diverse settings that fine-tuning the LLM to work with the cache can help it mimic the original results. Prompt Choreography significantly reduces per-message latency (2.0--6.2$\times$ faster time-to-first-token) and achieves substantial end-to-end speedups ($>$2.2$\times$) in some workflows dominated by redundant computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder incorporating modern architectural advancements like RoPE, FlashAttention, and refined normalization, which TabiBERT aims to address.

Method: TabiBERT integrates ModernBERT architecture (RoPE, FlashAttention, refined normalization) and is trained on a curated corpus of one trillion tokens from diverse domains (web text, scientific publications, etc.).

Result: TabiBERT supports 8,192-token context, achieves 2.65x inference speedup, reduces GPU memory usage, and scores 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and setting state-of-the-art in 5/8 categories.

Conclusion: TabiBERT demonstrates robust cross-domain generalization and establishes new benchmarks for Turkish NLP, with released resources for transparent research.

Abstract: Since the inception of BERT, encoder-only Transformers have evolved significantly in computational efficiency, training stability, and long-context modeling. ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). The model supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories: question answering (+9.55), code retrieval (+2.41), and document retrieval (+0.60). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization. We release model weights, training configurations, and evaluation code for transparent, reproducible Turkish encoder research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of large language models (LLMs) by improving efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Method: Introduces a MatMul-free LM with fixed/shared weights and reservoir layers, combined operations for memory efficiency.

Result: Reduces parameters by 19%, training time by 9.9%, inference time by 8.0%, with comparable performance.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively balances computational efficiency and model performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing; however, their high computational cost remains a major bottleneck. In this study, we target computational efficiency by focusing on a matrix multiplication free language model (MatMul-free LM) and further reducing the training cost through an architecture inspired by reservoir computing. Specifically, we partially fix and share the weights of selected layers in the MatMul-free LM and insert reservoir layers to obtain rich dynamic representations without additional training overhead. Additionally, several operations are combined to reduce memory accesses. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture reduces the number of parameters by up to 19%, training time by 9.9%, and inference time by 8.0%, while maintaining comparable performance to the baseline model.

Motivation: The study aims to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating scientific TLDRs and compare them with human-authored summaries, addressing the lack of a high-quality dataset.

Method: The authors propose BiomedTLDR, a dataset of researcher-authored summaries, and test open-weight LLMs for TLDR generation based on abstracts.

Result: LLMs tend to be more extractive, aligning closely with the original text's style, while some produce human-like summaries.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential but differ from humans in summarization style; BiomedTLDR enables better evaluation and development of LLMs.

Abstract: High-quality scientific extreme summary (TLDR) facilitates effective science communication. How do large language models (LLMs) perform in generating them? How are LLM-generated summaries different from those written by human experts? However, the lack of a comprehensive, high-quality scientific TLDR dataset hinders both the development and evaluation of LLMs' summarization ability. To address these, we propose a novel dataset, BiomedTLDR, containing a large sample of researcher-authored summaries from scientific papers, which leverages the common practice of including authors' comments alongside bibliography items. We then test popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on abstracts. Our analysis reveals that, although some of them successfully produce humanoid summaries, LLMs generally exhibit a greater affinity for the original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, hence tend to be more extractive rather than abstractive in general, compared to humans. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/netknowledge/LLM_summarization (Lyu and Ke, 2025).

TL;DR: LLM-PeerReview is an unsupervised LLM ensemble method that selects the best response from multiple candidates using a peer-review-inspired framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The method aims to harness the collective strengths of diverse LLMs to improve response quality without requiring supervision.

Method: It uses LLM-as-a-Judge for scoring, aggregates scores via graphical models or averaging, and selects the highest-scoring response.

Result: Outperforms Smoothie-Global by 6.9% and 7.3% across four datasets.

Conclusion: LLM-PeerReview is a simple yet powerful approach for improving LLM ensemble performance.

Abstract: We propose LLM-PeerReview, an unsupervised LLM Ensemble method that selects the most ideal response from multiple LLM-generated candidates for each query, harnessing the collective wisdom of multiple models with diverse strengths. LLM-PeerReview is built on a novel, peer-review-inspired framework that offers a clear and interpretable mechanism, while remaining fully unsupervised for flexible adaptability and generalization. Specifically, it operates in three stages: For scoring, we use the emerging LLM-as-a-Judge technique to evaluate each response by reusing multiple LLMs at hand; For reasoning, we can apply a principled graphical model-based truth inference algorithm or a straightforward averaging strategy to aggregate multiple scores to produce a final score for each response; Finally, the highest-scoring response is selected as the best ensemble output. LLM-PeerReview is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. The two variants of the proposed approach obtain strong results across four datasets, including outperforming the recent advanced model Smoothie-Global by 6.9% and 7.3% points, respectively.

*Saif Khalfan Saif Al Mazrouei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Anka, a constrained DSL for data pipelines, significantly boosts LLM code generation accuracy, especially on multi-step tasks, compared to flexible languages like Python.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with systematic errors in multi-step programming tasks due to the ambiguity of general-purpose languages. Anka addresses this by introducing explicit, constrained syntax.

Method: Developed Anka, a DSL for data transformation pipelines, and tested its effectiveness with LLMs like Claude 3.5 Haiku and GPT-4o-mini on benchmark tasks.

Result: Claude 3.5 Haiku achieved 99.9% parse success and 95.8% task accuracy with Anka, outperforming Python by 40 percentage points on multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: Constrained DSLs like Anka can enhance LLM accuracy on complex tasks, demonstrating their potential over general-purpose languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, yet they exhibit systematic errors on complex, multi-step programming tasks. We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management. To test this hypothesis, we introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines designed with explicit, constrained syntax that reduces ambiguity in code generation. Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training. We release the complete language implementation, benchmark suite, and evaluation framework to facilitate further research.

*Dianyun Wang,Qingsen Ma,Yuhu Shang,Zhifeng Lu,Lechen Ning,Zhenbo Xu,Huijia Wu,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled space for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, achieving high performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current low-rank adaptation methods lack interpretability and direct control due to implicit subspace learning.

Method: Leverages SAEs to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled space and constructs an interpretable low-rank subspace for adapter initialization.

Result: Achieves up to 99.6% safety rate (exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points) while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters.

Conclusion: Incorporating mechanistic interpretability improves both performance and transparency in fine-tuning.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become the dominant paradigm for adapting large language models to downstream tasks. Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features. Our work demonstrates that incorporating mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address false advertising and evasion tactics in e-commerce live streaming, particularly in health and medical sectors.

Method: Transform LiveAMR into a text-to-text generation task, leveraging LLMs for additional training data.

Result: Improved performance in detecting morphs and enhancing live streaming regulation.

Conclusion: LiveAMR effectively tackles pronunciation-based evasion, aiding regulatory efforts.

Abstract: E-commerce live streaming in China, particularly on platforms like Douyin, has become a major sales channel, but hosts often use morphs to evade scrutiny and engage in false advertising. This study introduces the Live Auditory Morph Resolution (LiveAMR) task to detect such violations. Unlike previous morph research focused on text-based evasion in social media and underground industries, LiveAMR targets pronunciation-based evasion in health and medical live streams. We constructed the first LiveAMR dataset with 86,790 samples and developed a method to transform the task into a text-to-text generation problem. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate additional training data, we improved performance and demonstrated that morph resolution significantly enhances live streaming regulation.

TL;DR: AI4Reading is a multi-agent system using LLMs and speech synthesis to automate audiobook interpretations, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual audiobook interpretation creation is resource-heavy; AI4Reading seeks to automate this process efficiently.

Method: The system employs 11 specialized agents (e.g., topic analysts, narrators) to collaboratively generate scripts while maintaining content fidelity and clarity.

Result: AI4Reading's scripts are simpler and more accurate than manual ones but lag slightly in speech quality.

Conclusion: AI4Reading shows promise for automating audiobook interpretations, though speech synthesis improvements are needed.

Abstract: Audiobook interpretations are attracting increasing attention, as they provide accessible and in-depth analyses of books that offer readers practical insights and intellectual inspiration. However, their manual creation process remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose AI4Reading, a multi-agent collaboration system leveraging large language models (LLMs) and speech synthesis technology to generate podcast, like audiobook interpretations. The system is designed to meet three key objectives: accurate content preservation, enhanced comprehensibility, and a logical narrative structure. To achieve these goals, we develop a framework composed of 11 specialized agents,including topic analysts, case analysts, editors, a narrator, and proofreaders that work in concert to explore themes, extract real world cases, refine content organization, and synthesize natural spoken language. By comparing expert interpretations with our system's output, the results show that although AI4Reading still has a gap in speech generation quality, the generated interpretative scripts are simpler and more accurate.

Result: A comprehensive framework connecting cognitive neuroscience with AI memory mechanisms, highlighting gaps and future opportunities.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of memory in AI, proposing future research focuses like multimodal memory and skill acquisition.

Abstract: Memory serves as the pivotal nexus bridging past and future, providing both humans and AI systems with invaluable concepts and experience to navigate complex tasks. Recent research on autonomous agents has increasingly focused on designing efficient memory workflows by drawing on cognitive neuroscience. However, constrained by interdisciplinary barriers, existing works struggle to assimilate the essence of human memory mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge of memory, connecting insights from cognitive neuroscience with LLM-driven agents. Specifically, we first elucidate the definition and function of memory along a progressive trajectory from cognitive neuroscience through LLMs to agents. We then provide a comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage mechanisms, and the complete management lifecycle from both biological and artificial perspectives. Subsequently, we review the mainstream benchmarks for evaluating agent memory. Additionally, we explore memory security from dual perspectives of attack and defense. Finally, we envision future research directions, with a focus on multimodal memory systems and skill acquisition.

TL;DR: SGR enhances LLMs' reasoning by dynamically generating external subgraphs tailored to queries, guiding step-by-step reasoning for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with noisy data and inconsistency in tasks requiring deep reasoning. SGR aims to mitigate these issues by leveraging structured external knowledge.

Method: SGR constructs query-relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and uses them to guide multi-step reasoning, integrating paths for final answers.

Result: SGR outperforms baselines on benchmark datasets, showing improved reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: SGR effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning by reducing noise and grounding inference in structured knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks in recent years, including machine translation, text generation, and question answering. As their applications extend to increasingly complex scenarios, however, LLMs continue to face challenges in tasks that require deep reasoning and logical inference. In particular, models trained on large scale textual corpora may incorporate noisy or irrelevant information during generation, which can lead to incorrect predictions or outputs that are inconsistent with factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs based on external subgraph generation, termed SGR. The proposed framework dynamically constructs query relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and leverages their semantic structure to guide the reasoning process. By performing reasoning in a step by step manner over structured subgraphs, SGR reduces the influence of noisy information and improves reasoning accuracy. Specifically, the framework first generates an external subgraph tailored to the input query, then guides the model to conduct multi step reasoning grounded in the subgraph, and finally integrates multiple reasoning paths to produce the final answer. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method, addresses performance degradation in autoregressive LLMs during multi-epoch training by selectively masking low-entropy tokens and using a curriculum schedule for regularization strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation in autoregressive models due to repeated data exposure, caused by an imbalance in learning dynamics where low-entropy tokens dominate optimization.

Method: Introduces EntroDrop, which selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and adjusts regularization strength dynamically via a curriculum schedule.

Result: Experiments on models with 0.6B to 8B parameters show EntroDrop outperforms standard regularization and maintains performance in multi-epoch training.

Conclusion: Aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics improves LLM adaptation in data-constrained domains, with EntroDrop offering a promising solution.

Abstract: As access to high-quality, domain-specific data grows increasingly scarce, multi-epoch training has become a practical strategy for adapting large language models (LLMs). However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. Our approach offers a promising pathway toward more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains.

### [221] [The Effect of Gender Diversity on Scientific Team Impact: A Team Roles Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23429)
*Yi Zhao,Yongjun Zhu,Donghun Kim,Yuzhuo Wang,Heng Zhang,Chao Lu,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how gender diversity in leadership and support roles affects scientific team success, measured by citations. Findings reveal an inverted U-shape relationship, with all-female leaders and all-male support teams performing best. Team size moderates the impact of leadership diversity but not support diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research on gender diversity's impact on team success is inconsistent and overlooks role differentiation, prompting a need for nuanced analysis of leadership and support roles.

Method: Analyzed 130,000+ PLOS papers using author contribution statements to classify roles (leadership/support) and multivariable/threshold regression models to assess diversity's impact on citations.

Result: Inverted U-shape relationship found for diversity in both roles; all-female leadership with all-male support teams performed best. Leadership diversity's effect varies with team size, while support diversity's impact remains consistently positive.

Conclusion: Gender diversity's effect on team impact is nuanced, dependent on roles and team size, highlighting the importance of role-specific analysis in understanding team success.

Abstract: The influence of gender diversity on the success of scientific teams is of great interest to academia. However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams. In contrast, the estimates for support-group gender diversity remain significant and positive, regardless of team size.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClinDEF is a dynamic framework for evaluating LLMs' clinical reasoning via simulated dialogues, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by incorporating granular, multi-level assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks lack representation of dynamic clinical reasoning processes, relying on static Q&A or limited datasets. ClinDEF aims to provide a more nuanced evaluation.

Method: ClinDEF uses a disease knowledge graph to generate patient cases and simulate multi-turn dialogues between an LLM doctor and automated patient agent. It includes fine-grained efficiency and rubric-based quality assessments.

Result: ClinDEF successfully identifies clinical reasoning gaps in top LLMs, demonstrating a more meaningful evaluation than traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: ClinDEF offers a robust, clinically relevant framework for assessing LLMs' diagnostic capabilities, highlighting its potential for improving medical AI evaluations.

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis begins with doctor-patient interaction, during which physicians iteratively gather information, determine examination and refine differential diagnosis through patients' response. This dynamic clinical-reasoning process is poorly represented by existing LLM benchmarks that focus on static question-answering. To mitigate these gaps, recent methods explore dynamic medical frameworks involving interactive clinical dialogues. Although effective, they often rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation. In this work, we propose ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, our method dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. Our evaluation protocol goes beyond diagnostic accuracy by incorporating fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality. Experiments show that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, offering a more nuanced and clinically meaningful evaluation paradigm.

*Ang Lv,Jin Ma,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ERC loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss for MoE models, ensuring router decisions align with expert capabilities through constraints on activations, improving performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE models lack constraints to align router decisions with expert capabilities, limiting performance. The goal is to enhance this alignment without heavy computational costs.

Method: Propose ERC loss, treating router embeddings as proxy tokens and enforcing two constraints: (1) experts activate more for their own proxies, (2) proxies activate more from their own experts.

Result: ERC loss improves MoE model performance (3B to 15B parameters) with minimal computational overhead, offering insights into expert specialization.

Conclusion: ERC loss effectively aligns router decisions with expert capabilities, enhancing MoE model performance and providing valuable training insights.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.

TL;DR: A nested density clustering method is proposed to hierarchically classify semantic relationships in text corpora using LLM embeddings, validated on diverse datasets for robustness and applied to scientometrics and topic evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover hierarchical semantic relationships in text corpora, which remain opaque despite the use of LLM embeddings for similarity retrieval.

Method: Nested density clustering relaxed iteratively merges dense clusters into diffuse ones, constructing a hierarchical tree of semantic relationships.

Result: Validated on scientific abstracts, newsgroups, and movie reviews, the method robustly reveals hierarchical semantic structures without predefined categories.

Conclusion: The approach enables data-driven discovery of semantic hierarchies and applications in scientometrics and topic evolution, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Semantic text classification has undergone significant advances in recent years due to the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their high dimensional embeddings. While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster - the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 News- groups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.

TL;DR: ACT is a three-stage algorithm for detecting biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature, outperforming existing methods with high F1, Recall, and Precision scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks struggle with short, paraphrased, or embedded quotations. ACT aims to address these gaps.

Method: ACT combines morphology-aware alignment with context-sensitive enrichment to identify complex citation patterns.

Result: ACT-QE achieves F1=0.91, Recall=0.89, Precision=0.94, outperforming baselines like Dicta and Passim.

Conclusion: ACT improves quotation detection and opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents ACT (Allocate Connections between Texts), a novel three-stage algorithm for the automatic detection of biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature. Unlike existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations, ACT combines a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage that identifies complex citation patterns such as "Wave" and "Echo" quotations.
  Our approach was evaluated against leading systems, including Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, as well as human-annotated critical editions. We further assessed three ACT configurations to isolate the contribution of each component. Results demonstrate that the full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms all baselines, achieving an F1 score of 0.91, with superior Recall (0.89) and Precision (0.94). Notably, ACT-2, which lacks stylistic enrichment, achieves higher Recall (0.90) but suffers in Precision, while ACT-3, using longer n-grams, offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity.
  In addition to improving quotation detection, ACT's ability to classify stylistic patterns across corpora opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis. This work contributes to digital humanities and computational philology by addressing the methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment. ACT lays a foundation for broader applications in historical textual analysis, especially in morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Aggadic literature.

Result: Semantic generation improves understanding; shows better data scaling/utilization and effective visual detail capture via autoregression.

Conclusion: Semantics generation enhances understanding in unified models, with superior data efficiency and detail capture.

Abstract: Vision-language large models are moving toward the unification of visual understanding and visual generation tasks. However, whether generation can enhance understanding is still under-explored on large data scale. In this work, we analysis the unified model with a concise structure, UniHetero, under large-scale pretraining (>200M samples). Our key observations are: (1) Generation can improve understanding, but Only if you generate Semantics, Not Pixels. (2) Generation reveals a superior Data Scaling trend and higher Data Utilization. (3) Autoregression on Input Embedding is effective to capture visual details.

*Hazel Kim,Philip Torr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoLaCE, a lightweight framework, combats confirmation bias in LLMs by mixing experts over latent concepts, improving robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from confirmation bias, especially harmful in multi-agent debates where biases are reinforced. MoLaCE addresses this issue.

Method: MoLaCE uses a mixture of experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts to diversify responses and reduce bias.

Result: MoLaCE reduces confirmation bias, enhances robustness, and outperforms multi-agent debate with much less computation.

Conclusion: MoLaCE effectively mitigates LLM confirmation bias, offering scalable and efficient improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly vulnerable to input confirmation bias. When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.

Result: The method achieves up to 16% relative accuracy and 20% F1-score improvements over standard self-detection and SelfCheckGPT.

Conclusion: Structuring LLM outputs as knowledge graphs enhances hallucination detection, offering a low-cost, model-agnostic solution for safer language models.

Abstract: Hallucinations, the generation of apparently convincing yet false statements, remain a major barrier to the safe deployment of LLMs. Building on the strong performance of self-detection methods, we examine the use of structured knowledge representations, namely knowledge graphs, to improve hallucination self-detection. Specifically, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that enriches hallucination self-detection by (i) converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, and (ii) using these graphs to estimate the likelihood that a response contains hallucinations. We evaluate the proposed approach using two widely used LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across two hallucination detection datasets. To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score. Our results show that LLMs can better analyse atomic facts when they are structured as knowledge graphs, even when initial outputs contain inaccuracies. This low-cost, model-agnostic approach paves the way toward safer and more trustworthy language models.

*Daiki Shiono,Shumpei Miyawaki,Ryota Tanaka,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LVLMs lose instruction-following ability post fine-tuning; specifying output formats in training data helps mitigate this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the decline in LVLMs' instruction-following ability after fine-tuning with visual instruction datasets.

Method: Constructed datasets highlighting output format specifications and evaluated their impact on LVLMs' performance.

Result: LVLMs' instruction-following declines with standard datasets but improves when output format instructions are included.

Conclusion: Including output format instructions in training datasets can help preserve LVLMs' instruction-following abilities.

Abstract: Following the initial flourishing of large language models (LLMs), there has been a surge in proposed large vision-language models (LVLMs) that integrate LLMs with vision capabilities. However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities.

### [230] [Style Amnesia: Investigating Speaking Style Degradation and Mitigation in Multi-Turn Spoken Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23578)
*Yu-Xiang Lin,Cheng-Han Chiang,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs fail to maintain instructed speaking styles over multiple turns, termed 'style amnesia'; explicit recall prompts help partially mitigate this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why SLMs lose instructed speaking styles (emotion, accent, volume, speed) over conversations.

Method: Evaluated three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, testing style maintenance and recall ability.

Result: SLMs cannot maintain styles but can recall instructions; system prompts worsen style adherence.

Conclusion: Style amnesia persists in SLMs; explicit recall and user prompts partially address the issue.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that when spoken language models (SLMs) are instructed to speak in a specific speaking style at the beginning of a multi-turn conversation, they cannot maintain the required speaking styles after several turns of interaction; we refer to this as the style amnesia of SLMs. We focus on paralinguistic speaking styles, including emotion, accent, volume, and speaking speed. We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.

TL;DR: InfTool is a fully autonomous framework that enhances LLMs' tool invocation by using self-evolving multi-agent synthesis to generate diverse, verified trajectories, improving accuracy from 19.8% to 70.9% on BFCL without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind InfTool is to overcome challenges like expensive human annotation, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings in existing approaches for LLMs to reliably invoke external tools.

Method: InfTool employs a closed-loop framework with three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, MCP Server) to generate diverse trajectories from raw API specs. It uses GRPO with gated rewards for training.

Result: Experiments on BFCL show InfTool boosts a 32B model's accuracy from 19.8% to 70.9%, surpassing larger models and rivaling Claude-Opus, all from synthetic data.

Conclusion: InfTool effectively breaks barriers in autonomous tool invocation for LLMs, achieving significant performance gains through self-evolving synthesis and closed-loop training.

Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to reliably invoke external tools remains a critical bottleneck for autonomous agents. Existing approaches suffer from three fundamental challenges: expensive human annotation for high-quality trajectories, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings inherent in single-model synthesis that perpetuate biases and coverage gaps. We introduce InfTool, a fully autonomous framework that breaks these barriers through self-evolving multi-agent synthesis. Given only raw API specifications, InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) to generate diverse, verified trajectories spanning single-turn calls to complex multi-step workflows. The framework establishes a closed loop: synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps, and this cycle iterates without human intervention. Experiments on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) demonstrate that InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, and entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.

TL;DR: A new dataset, CHQ-Sum, is introduced to address the lack of domain-expert annotated datasets for summarizing consumer health questions, aiding natural language understanding in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The web is flooded with overly descriptive consumer health questions, making natural language understanding challenging. Summarizing these questions can help distill key information.

Method: Created CHQ-Sum, a dataset with 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and summaries sourced from community forums.

Result: The dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts and supports benchmarking state-of-the-art summarization models.

Conclusion: CHQ-Sum fills a critical gap in healthcare summarization tasks and facilitates the development of efficient summarization systems.

Abstract: The quest for seeking health information has swamped the web with consumers health-related questions. Generally, con- sumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media. We benchmark the dataset on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to show the effectiveness of the dataset

TL;DR: LLMs are vulnerable to hidden prompt injection attacks in academic papers, with English, Japanese, and Chinese injections significantly altering review outcomes, while Arabic has minimal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the vulnerability of LLMs used in academic peer review to hidden adversarial prompt injections across different languages.

Method: Constructed a dataset of ~500 ICML-accepted papers, embedding hidden adversarial prompts in four languages (English, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic), and evaluated LLM review outcomes.

Result: English, Japanese, and Chinese injections caused major changes in review scores/decisions; Arabic had little effect.

Conclusion: LLM-based reviewing systems are susceptible to prompt injection, with varying impacts across languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered for use in high-impact workflows, including academic peer review. However, LLMs are vulnerable to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks. In this work, we construct a dataset of approximately 500 real academic papers accepted to ICML and evaluate the effect of embedding hidden adversarial prompts within these documents. Each paper is injected with semantically equivalent instructions in four different languages and reviewed using an LLM. We find that prompt injection induces substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, while Arabic injections produce little to no effect. These results highlight the susceptibility of LLM-based reviewing systems to document-level prompt injection and reveal notable differences in vulnerability across languages.

TL;DR: ProfASR-Bench is a professional-talk evaluation suite addressing challenges like domain terminology and entity errors in ASR, revealing a context-utilization gap where current systems underuse contextual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASR benchmarks overlook challenges in professional settings, such as dense terminology and critical entity errors, necessitating a specialized evaluation suite.

Method: ProfASR-Bench pairs natural-language prompts with entity-rich utterances to measure context-conditioned recognition, using Whisper and Qwen-Omni models under various contextual conditions.

Result: Lightweight textual context shows minimal impact on WER, highlighting a context-utilization gap where systems underuse available side information.

Conclusion: ProfASR-Bench offers a standardized testbed for context-aware ASR evaluation, revealing gaps in current models' prompt utilization.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.

*Sky CH-Wang,Justin Svegliato,Helen Appel,Jason Eisner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for fine-tuning language models using structured feedback-driven improvement chains outperforms standard preference tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve preference tuning of language models by leveraging fine-grained feedback and incremental revisions.

Method: Uses annotator feedback to mark liked/disliked spans, then rewrites disliked spans incrementally to form preference pairs for alignment.

Result: Outperforms standard A/B preference ranking and full contrastive rewrites.

Conclusion: Structured, revision-based supervision enhances preference tuning efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: We present a method and dataset for fine-tuning language models with preference supervision using feedback-driven improvement chains. Given a model response, an annotator provides fine-grained feedback by marking ``liked'' and ``disliked'' spans and specifying what they liked or disliked about them. The base model then rewrites the disliked spans accordingly, proceeding from left to right, forming a sequence of incremental improvements. We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits. We find that our approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for multi-turn behavior elicitation in LLMs, categorizing methods and showing online methods outperform static ones with higher success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve evaluation of LLMs by identifying specific behaviors in multi-turn conversations, extending beyond single-turn settings.

Method: Proposes an analytical framework categorizing elicitation methods into three families (prior knowledge, offline, online) and introduces a generalized multi-turn formulation for online methods.

Result: Online methods achieve success rates of 45-77% with few thousand queries, outperforming static methods which find few/no failure cases.

Conclusion: Highlights the effectiveness of online methods for multi-turn behavior elicitation and advocates for dynamic benchmarks in LLM evaluation.

Abstract: Identifying specific and often complex behaviors from large language models (LLMs) in conversational settings is crucial for their evaluation. Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.

### [238] [Pruning Graphs by Adversarial Robustness Evaluation to Strengthen GNN Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22128)
*Yongyu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pruning framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that uses adversarial robustness evaluation to remove fragile graph components, enhancing resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their reliance on graph topology and node features, which can amplify noise or perturbations.

Method: The framework leverages robustness scores to identify and prune edges likely to degrade model reliability, creating cleaner graph representations.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the method significantly improves GNN defense capability in high-perturbation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed pruning framework effectively enhances GNN robustness by selectively removing detrimental graph components.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data, thanks to their ability to jointly exploit node features and relational information encoded in the graph topology. This joint modeling, however, also introduces a critical weakness: perturbations or noise in either the structure or the features can be amplified through message passing, making GNNs highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and spurious connections. In this work, we introduce a pruning framework that leverages adversarial robustness evaluation to explicitly identify and remove fragile or detrimental components of the graph. By using robustness scores as guidance, our method selectively prunes edges that are most likely to degrade model reliability, thereby yielding cleaner and more resilient graph representations. We instantiate this framework on three representative GNN architectures and conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks. The experimental results show that our approach can significantly enhance the defense capability of GNNs in the high-perturbation regime.

*Hans Jarett J. Ong,Brian Godwin S. Lim,Dominic Dayta,Renzo Roel P. Tan,Kazushi Ikeda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANCA proposes a causal autoencoder with ANM constraints for unsupervised discovery, outperforming baselines by transforming residual independence into an optimization objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangling causal variables from observational data is challenging without supervision. LANCA aims to address this by leveraging ANM as an inductive bias.

Method: LANCA uses a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) with a differentiable ANM Layer, focusing on residual independence as an explicit objective.

Result: LANCA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow) and photorealistic environments (CANDLE).

Conclusion: LANCA's ANM-based approach resolves component-wise indeterminacy and enhances robustness against spurious correlations.

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning seeks to recover latent generative factors, yet standard methods relying on statistical independence often fail to capture causal dependencies. A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective. Empirically, LANCA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic physics benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow), and on photorealistic environments (CANDLE), where it demonstrates superior robustness to spurious correlations arising from complex background scenes.

TL;DR: TIDES is an LLM-based framework that enhances urban wireless traffic prediction by capturing spatial-temporal correlations through clustering, prompt engineering, and a DeepSeek module, outperforming existing methods efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for intelligent, adaptive resource management in wireless networks highlights the gap in current LLM-based models overlooking spatial dependencies in traffic dynamics.

Method: TIDES uses clustering for regional traffic patterns, prompt engineering to bridge data-LLM gaps, and a DeepSeek module for spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, fine-tuning lightweight components for efficiency.

Result: TIDES outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets, demonstrating scalability for 6G networks.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial awareness into LLM-based predictors is crucial for scalable and intelligent network management in future wireless systems.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent, adaptive resource management in next-generation wireless networks has underscored the importance of accurate and scalable wireless traffic prediction. While recent advancements in deep learning and foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising forecasting capabilities, they largely overlook the spatial dependencies inherent in city-scale traffic dynamics. In this paper, we propose TIDES (Traffic Intelligence with DeepSeek-Enhanced Spatial-temporal prediction), a novel LLM-based framework that captures spatial-temporal correlations for urban wireless traffic prediction. TIDES first identifies heterogeneous traffic patterns across regions through a clustering mechanism and trains personalized models for each region to balance generalization and specialization. To bridge the domain gap between numerical traffic data and language-based models, we introduce a prompt engineering scheme that embeds statistical traffic features as structured inputs. Furthermore, we design a DeepSeek module that enables spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, allowing the LLM to leverage information from spatially related regions. By fine-tuning only lightweight components while freezing core LLM layers, TIDES achieves efficient adaptation to domain-specific patterns without incurring excessive training overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets demonstrate that TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and robustness. Our results indicate that integrating spatial awareness into LLM-based predictors is the key to unlocking scalable and intelligent network management in future 6G systems.

*Rajeeb Thapa Chhetri,Zhixiong Chen,Saurab Thapa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Sculpting, a two-stage framework addressing generalization collapse in supervised deep learning by enforcing topological constraints in the latent space, achieving superior zero-shot anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised deep learning struggles with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data due to lack of topological constraints, leading to diffuse manifolds and poor generalization.

Method: Proposes Latent Sculpting: Stage 1 uses a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder with Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to sculpt benign data into a low-entropy cluster. Stage 2 employs Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) for density estimation.

Result: Achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on zero-shot anomalies, outperforming supervised (F1 ~0.30) and unsupervised (F1 0.76) baselines, with 88.89% detection rate on complex shifts.

Conclusion: Explicit manifold sculpting enables robust zero-shot generalization, suggesting decoupling structure learning from density estimation improves scalable anomaly detection.

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains is "Generalization Collapse": models learn precise decision boundaries for known distributions but fail catastrophically when facing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. We hypothesize that this failure stems from the lack of topological constraints in the latent space, resulting in diffuse manifolds where novel anomalies remain statistically indistinguishable from benign data. To address this, we propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage representation learning framework. Stage 1 utilizes a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder trained with a novel Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to actively "sculpt" benign traffic into a low-entropy, hyperspherical cluster. Unlike standard contrastive losses that rely on triplet mining, DCCL optimizes global cluster centroids to enforce absolute manifold density. Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on this pre-structured manifold to learn an exact density estimate. We evaluate this methodology on the rigorous CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, treating it as a proxy for complex, non-stationary data streams. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization. While supervised baselines suffered catastrophic performance collapse on unseen distribution shifts (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline achieved only 0.76, our framework achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies. Notably, we report an 88.89% detection rate on "Infiltration" scenarios--a complex distributional shift where state-of-the-art supervised models achieved 0.00% accuracy. These findings suggest that decoupling structure learning from density estimation provides a scalable path toward generalized anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a reinforcement learning framework using DDQN and curriculum learning to optimize tennis strategy, achieving high win rates but revealing a defensive bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tennis strategy optimization is complex due to hierarchical scoring, stochastic outcomes, and opponent adaptation. The goal is to develop a robust RL solution.

Method: A custom tennis simulation integrates DDQN with curriculum learning, modeling scoring, fatigue, and opponent skill. Dueling architecture and double Q-learning stabilize training.

Result: The agent achieves 98-100% win rates against balanced opponents, with serve and return efficiencies at 63.0-67.5% and 52.8-57.1%, respectively. Defensive bias is noted.

Conclusion: While successful, the win-rate focus reveals defensive biases, highlighting the need for better reward design in sports RL.

Abstract: Tennis strategy optimization is a challenging sequential decision-making problem involving hierarchical scoring, stochastic outcomes, long-horizon credit assignment, physical fatigue, and adaptation to opponent skill. I present a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a custom tennis simulation environment with a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network(DDQN) trained using curriculum learning. The environment models complete tennis scoring at the level of points, games, and sets, rally-level tactical decisions across ten discrete action categories, symmetric fatigue dynamics, and a continuous opponent skill parameter. The dueling architecture decomposes action-value estimation into state-value and advantage components, while double Q-learning reduces overestimation bias and improves training stability in this long-horizon stochastic domain. Curriculum learning progressively increases opponent difficulty from 0.40 to 0.50, enabling robust skill acquisition without the training collapse observed under fixed opponents. Across extensive evaluations, the trained agent achieves win rates between 98 and 100 percent against balanced opponents and maintains strong performance against more challenging opponents. Serve efficiency ranges from 63.0 to 67.5 percent, and return efficiency ranges from 52.8 to 57.1 percent. Ablation studies demonstrate that both the dueling architecture and curriculum learning are necessary for stable convergence, while a standard DQN baseline fails to learn effective policies. Despite strong performance, tactical analysis reveals a pronounced defensive bias, with the learned policy prioritizing error avoidance and prolonged rallies over aggressive point construction. These results highlight a limitation of win-rate driven optimization in simplified sports simulations and emphasize the importance of reward design for realistic sports reinforcement learning.

Building on this, we present Bayesian PINNs as a principled framework to quantify epistemic uncertainty and deliver robust predictions under sparse data. Finally, we outline emerging research directions that highlight the potential of physics-aware and trustworthy machine learning for critical power assets.

KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.

TL;DR: The paper explores Neural Networks (NNs) and their extensions for power transformer condition monitoring, addressing limitations of traditional methods with advanced ML techniques like CNNs and RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional condition monitoring methods for power transformers struggle with uncertainty and complexity, necessitating more robust solutions using ML.

Method: The paper introduces Neural Networks (NNs), applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for condition monitoring, and integrates NNs with Reinforcement Learning (RL) for decision-making.

Result: Advanced ML techniques, particularly CNNs and RL, enhance accuracy in diagnostics, prognostics, and control for power transformers.

Conclusion: NNs and their extensions offer promising solutions for transformer health management, with emerging research directions highlighted.

Abstract: Power transformers are critical assets in power networks, whose reliability directly impacts grid resilience and stability. Traditional condition monitoring approaches, often rule-based or purely physics-based, struggle with uncertainty, limited data availability, and the complexity of modern operating conditions. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) provide powerful tools to complement and extend these methods, enabling more accurate diagnostics, prognostics, and control. In this two-part series, we examine the role of Neural Networks (NNs) and their extensions in transformer condition monitoring and health management tasks. This first paper introduces the basic concepts of NNs, explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for condition monitoring using diverse data modalities, and discusses the integration of NN concepts within the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm for decision-making and control. Finally, perspectives on emerging research directions are also provided.

### [246] [The Law of Multi-Model Collaboration: Scaling Limits of Model Ensembling for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23340)
*Dakuan Lu,Jiaqi Zhang,Cheng Yuan,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, predicting performance limits of LLM ensembles based on aggregated parameter budgets, showing superior scaling compared to single models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM performance is bounded individually, but interactions among multiple models can exceed these limits. A theoretical framework for multi-model collaboration is lacking.

Method: Introduces a method-agnostic formulation assuming an idealized integration oracle, predicting ensemble performance via minimum cross-entropy loss from any model in the pool.

Result: Multi-model systems scale via power-law with total parameters, showing greater improvement and lower loss than single models. Heterogeneous ensembles outperform homogeneous ones.

Conclusion: Model collaboration, especially with diversity, is key to advancing LLM intelligence beyond individual model limits.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been largely driven by scaling laws for individual models, which predict performance improvements as model parameters and data volume increase. However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.

*Jiahao Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the spectral bias of CNNs, introduces a framework to track weight frequencies, and proposes a metric (SSR) to quantify regularizers' low-pass filtering effects. It shows L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy and discusses an accuracy-robustness trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the physical mechanisms behind regularization techniques like L2 and Dropout, particularly their feature frequency selection, which is poorly understood.

Method: The authors introduce a Visual Diagnostic Framework to monitor weight frequency evolution and propose the Spectral Suppression Ratio (SSR) to measure regularization effects. They address aliasing in small kernels using discrete radial profiling.

Result: Empirical results on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10 show L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by over 3x. L2 models are sensitive to Gaussian noise but robust against high-frequency information loss, outperforming baselines in blurred scenarios by >6%.

Conclusion: The work confirms that regularization imposes a spectral inductive bias towards low-frequency structures, offering a signal-processing perspective on generalization.

Abstract: Regularization techniques such as L2 regularization (Weight Decay) and Dropout are fundamental to training deep neural networks, yet their underlying physical mechanisms regarding feature frequency selection remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the Spectral Bias of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We introduce a Visual Diagnostic Framework to track the dynamic evolution of weight frequencies during training and propose a novel metric, the Spectral Suppression Ratio (SSR), to quantify the "low-pass filtering" intensity of different regularizers. By addressing the aliasing issue in small kernels (e.g., 3x3) through discrete radial profiling, our empirical results on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by over 3x compared to unregularized baselines. Furthermore, we reveal a critical Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off: while L2 models are sensitive to broadband Gaussian noise due to over-specialization in low frequencies, they exhibit superior robustness against high-frequency information loss (e.g., low resolution), outperforming baselines by >6% in blurred scenarios. This work provides a signal-processing perspective on generalization, confirming that regularization enforces a strong spectral inductive bias towards low-frequency structures.

### [248] [Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS): A Homeostatic Framework for Adaptive Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22200)
*Dhruv Tiwari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a bio-inspired framework replacing traditional reward functions with continuous, internal feedback mechanisms like curiosity and stress to improve agent robustness and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI methods rely on static reward functions, leading to fragile performance in dynamic environments. The paper argues for integrating biological emotion analogs to enhance autonomy.

Method: Proposes EILS, modeling emotions as continuous, homeostatic signals (e.g., curiosity, stress) derived from interaction history. These dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape.

Result: Hypothesizes that EILS will outperform traditional methods in sample efficiency and adaptation to non-stationary environments.

Conclusion: EILS offers a unified, bio-inspired approach to enhance agent robustness by replacing scattered heuristics with internal feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: The ruling method in modern Artificial Intelligence spanning from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) relies on a surge of static, externally defined reward functions. While this "extrinsic maximization" approach has rendered superhuman performance in closed, stationary fields, it produces agents that are fragile in open-ended, real-world environments. Standard agents lack internal autonomy: they struggle to explore without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and require extensive manual tuning of static hyperparameters. This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation.

### [249] [Transformer Reconstructed with Dynamic Value Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22212)
*Xiaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Dynamic Value Attention (DVA), a method replacing multi-head attention in transformers with a single-head approach that dynamically adjusts values per query, reducing complexity and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The static value assignment per query in traditional transformers is inefficient, and multi-head attention is limited by complexity. The goal is to optimize this by dynamically assigning values per query.

Method: The authors introduce DVA, which dynamically selects values for each query, eliminating redundant heads and simplifying the architecture by removing the need for subsequent feed-forward networks.

Result: Experiments show DVA reduces training time by 37.6% compared to the original transformer while enhancing learning capability.

Conclusion: A single-head DVA is sufficient and more efficient than traditional multi-head attention in transformers, offering significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Since transformer was firstly published in 2017, several works have been proposed to optimize it. However, the major structure of transformer remains unchanged, ignoring one of its main intrinsic limitations, which is the same static value is used for every query in a head. Transformer itself tries to solve this problem by implementing multi-head attentions, yet the number of heads is limited by complexity. I propose a method to decide a value for each query dynamically, which could cut down all the redundant heads, keeping only one. Consequently, the following feed forward network could be cut down entirely, as each revised embedding has already fetched enough useful values far beyond the context. As a result, a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) is all you need in a transformer. According to the experiment, DVA may save 37.6% training time than the original transformer meanwhile increasing the learning capability.

### [250] [On the Existence and Behaviour of Secondary Attention Sinks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22213)
*Jeffrey T. H. Wong,Cheng Zhang,Louis Mahon,Wayne Luk,Anton Isopoussu,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and analyzes secondary attention sinks in transformer models, contrasting them with primary sinks, and explores their formation, properties, and impact on attention mechanisms across various model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works studied primary attention sinks (like BOS tokens), but this work aims to uncover and understand secondary sinks, which differ in behavior and impact.

Method: The study involves extensive experiments across 11 model families, analyzing sink properties, formation mechanisms (linked to MLP modules), and their influence on attention.

Result: Secondary sinks arise in middle layers, persist variably, and are formed by MLPs aligning token representations with primary sinks. Their norms determine sink scores and longevity.

Conclusion: Secondary sinks are distinct from primary sinks, emerging deterministically in larger models with measurable impacts on attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Attention sinks are tokens, often the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token, that receive disproportionately high attention despite limited semantic relevance. In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.

*Soroush Vahidi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed a framework for semi-supervised node classification that adapts to homophilic and heterophilic graphs using combinatorial inference, offering interpretability, tunability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses GNNs' struggle with heterophily by focusing on explicit combinatorial inference instead of deep message passing.

Method: Uses a confidence-ordered greedy procedure with an additive scoring function combining class priors, neighborhood stats, feature similarity, and label compatibility. Introduces a hybrid strategy with optional neural refinement.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks while maintaining interpretability and efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms modern GNNs in heterophilic scenarios, providing adaptability, transparency, and computational benefits.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance on homophilic graphs but often struggle under heterophily, where adjacent nodes frequently belong to different classes. We propose an interpretable and adaptive framework for semi-supervised node classification based on explicit combinatorial inference rather than deep message passing. Our method assigns labels using a confidence-ordered greedy procedure driven by an additive scoring function that integrates class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and training-derived label-label compatibility. A small set of transparent hyperparameters controls the relative influence of these components, enabling smooth adaptation between homophilic and heterophilic regimes.
  We further introduce a validation-gated hybrid strategy in which combinatorial predictions are optionally injected as priors into a lightweight neural model. Hybrid refinement is applied only when it improves validation performance, preserving interpretability when neuralization is unnecessary. All adaptation signals are computed strictly from training data, ensuring a leakage-free evaluation protocol. Experiments on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with modern GNNs while offering advantages in interpretability, tunability, and computational efficiency.

*Gnankan Landry Regis N'guessan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSN introduces learnable fractional power bases for neural networks, outperforming standard MLPs in approximating singular functions with fewer parameters and better accuracy, especially in physics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard neural networks struggle with approximating singular or fractional power functions common in physics. MSN aims to address this limitation by leveraging classical approximation theory.

Method: MSN replaces fixed activations with learnable fractional power bases, allowing exponents and coefficients to be trained. It uses $φ(x) = \sum_k a_k |x|^{μ_k} + \sum_k b_k \mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{λ_k}$ as its activation function.

Result: MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters on singular functions. In PINN benchmarks, it shows 3-6x improvement and learns interpretable exponents matching known physics solutions.

Conclusion: Theory-guided design like MSN significantly improves performance for scientifically relevant function classes, offering better accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Standard neural network architectures employ fixed activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid) that are poorly suited for approximating functions with singular or fractional power behavior, a structure that arises ubiquitously in physics, including boundary layers, fracture mechanics, and corner singularities. We introduce Müntz-Szász Networks (MSN), a novel architecture that replaces fixed smooth activations with learnable fractional power bases grounded in classical approximation theory. Each MSN edge computes $φ(x) = \sum_k a_k |x|^{μ_k} + \sum_k b_k \mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{λ_k}$, where the exponents $\{μ_k, λ_k\}$ are learned alongside the coefficients. We prove that MSN inherits universal approximation from the Müntz-Szász theorem and establish novel approximation rates: for functions of the form $|x|^α$, MSN achieves error $\mathcal{O}(|μ- α|^2)$ with a single learned exponent, whereas standard MLPs require $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-1/α})$ neurons for comparable accuracy. On supervised regression with singular target functions, MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a particularly demanding application for singular function approximation; on PINN benchmarks including a singular ODE and stiff boundary-layer problems, MSN achieves 3-6x improvement while learning interpretable exponents that match the known solution structure. Our results demonstrate that theory-guided architectural design can yield dramatic improvements for scientifically-motivated function classes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGAIN is a multi-stage framework combining traffic summarization, retrieval-augmented generation, and LLM reasoning for transparent, accurate network traffic analysis, achieving high accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional network traffic analysis systems suffer from high false positives and lack interpretability, limiting analyst trust.

Method: ReGAIN uses traffic summarization, embeds summaries into a vector database, and employs hierarchical retrieval with metadata filtering, MMR sampling, cross-encoder reranking, and abstention mechanisms.

Result: Achieves 95.95%-98.82% accuracy on ICMP ping and TCP SYN flood traces, validated against ground truth and expert assessments.

Conclusion: ReGAIN outperforms rule-based, ML, and deep learning baselines while providing trustworthy, verifiable responses.

Abstract: Modern networks generate vast, heterogeneous traffic that must be continuously analyzed for security and performance. Traditional network traffic analysis systems, whether rule-based or machine learning-driven, often suffer from high false positives and lack interpretability, limiting analyst trust. In this paper, we present ReGAIN, a multi-stage framework that combines traffic summarization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for transparent and accurate network traffic analysis. ReGAIN creates natural-language summaries from network traffic, embeds them into a multi-collection vector database, and utilizes a hierarchical retrieval pipeline to ground LLM responses with evidence citations. The pipeline features metadata-based filtering, MMR sampling, a two-stage cross-encoder reranking mechanism, and an abstention mechanism to reduce hallucinations and ensure grounded reasoning. Evaluated on ICMP ping flood and TCP SYN flood traces from the real-world traffic dataset, it demonstrates robust performance, achieving accuracy between 95.95% and 98.82% across different attack types and evaluation benchmarks. These results are validated against two complementary sources: dataset ground truth and human expert assessments. ReGAIN also outperforms rule-based, classical ML, and deep learning baselines while providing unique explainability through trustworthy, verifiable responses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiRL is an efficient post-training framework for Diffusion Language Models, combining FlexAttention training with LMDeploy-optimized inference, achieving top math performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-training methods for dLLMs are inefficient and misaligned with inference, limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics.

Method: DiRL integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference, enabling efficient two-stage post-training (SFT followed by RL). DiPO, an unbiased GRPO implementation, is also introduced.

Result: DiRL-8B-Instruct achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and outperforms comparable models in the Qwen2.5 series on benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiRL addresses inefficiencies in dLLM post-training, demonstrating superior performance on complex tasks like mathematics.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to Auto-Regressive (AR) models. While recent efforts have validated their pre-training potential and accelerated inference speeds, the post-training landscape for dLLMs remains underdeveloped. Existing methods suffer from computational inefficiency and objective mismatches between training and inference, severely limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics. To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and surpasses comparable models in the Qwen2.5 series on several benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student) is a mask-progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to distill knowledge from large vision-language teachers to compact students efficiently and stably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are impractical for mobile or edge devices due to their size, necessitating compact yet capable models. Distilling knowledge from large teachers to small students is challenging because of the size gap.

Method: Masters uses mask-progressive reinforcement learning to reduce teacher complexity by masking non-dominant weights, then progressively restores the teacher's capacity. It includes an offline RL stage with accuracy and distillation rewards for efficient knowledge transfer.

Result: The framework enables stable learning and richer representation transfer, achieving strong performance without the computational cost of online think-answer RL.

Conclusion: Masters successfully addresses the challenges of distilling large VLMs into compact models, offering a practical solution for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have recently achieved remarkable multimodal understanding, but their massive size makes them impractical for deployment on mobile or edge devices. This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.

*Chama Bensmail*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoXplain is a framework that evaluates the stability of model explanations across repeated training, revealing multiple explanatory modes even in high-accuracy models like Logistic Regression and Random Forests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study challenges the assumption that high predictive accuracy implies trustworthy explanations by investigating whether models achieve similar outcomes through different internal logic.

Method: EvoXplain treats explanations as samples from stochastic optimization, examining if they form coherent explanations or separate into distinct modes, tested on Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets.

Result: Explanations often show multimodality, even in stable models like Logistic Regression, revealing explanatory instability not tied to hyperparameters or performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: EvoXplain highlights interpretability as a property of model classes under repeated training, not individual models, making explanatory instability visible and quantifiable.

Abstract: Machine learning models are primarily judged by predictive performance, especially in applied settings. Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.

*Abdul Malik Al Mardhouf Al Saadi,Amrita Basak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning model enhances bead geometry prediction in L-DED by leveraging cross-dataset knowledge transfer, outperforming traditional methods with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in predicting bead geometry accurately due to scarce and varied experimental datasets in L-DED.

Method: Two meta-learning algorithms, MAML and Reptile, are employed to enable rapid adaptation to new conditions with minimal data.

Result: Both algorithms achieve accurate predictions with few examples, showing strong generalization across diverse L-DED processes.

Conclusion: Meta-learning effectively transfers knowledge across heterogeneous L-DED settings, improving prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate bead geometry prediction in laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) is often hindered by the scarcity and heterogeneity of experimental datasets collected under different materials, machine configurations, and process parameters. To address this challenge, a cross-dataset knowledge transfer model based on meta-learning for predicting deposited track geometry in L-DED is proposed. Specifically, two gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, i.e., Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Reptile, are investigated to enable rapid adaptation to new deposition conditions with limited data. The proposed framework is performed using multiple experimental datasets compiled from peer-reviewed literature and in-house experiments and evaluated across powder-fed, wire-fed, and hybrid wire-powder L-DED processes. Results show that both MAML and Reptile achieve accurate bead height predictions on unseen target tasks using as few as three to nine training examples, consistently outperforming conventional feedforward neural networks trained under comparable data constraints. Across multiple target tasks representing different printing conditions, the meta-learning models achieve strong generalization performance, with R-squared values reaching up to approximately 0.9 and mean absolute errors between 0.03-0.08 mm, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer across heterogeneous L-DED settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates fairness and performance disparities in AI models (Sybil and Venkadesh21) for lung cancer risk estimation across demographic groups, revealing significant differences not explained by clinical factors. Emphasizes need for improved fairness in screening tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential biases and performance disparities in AI models used for lung cancer risk estimation across diverse demographic groups, ensuring equitable healthcare outcomes.

Method: Evaluated Sybil and Venkadesh21 models using NLST data, assessed AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across subgroups, and explored confounding factors using the JustEFAB framework.

Result: Significant performance differences were found, e.g., Sybil's AUROC was higher for women than men, and Venkadesh21's sensitivity was lower for Black participants. Confounders did not explain these disparities.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for monitoring and improving AI model fairness in lung cancer screening, urging further research on algorithmic equity.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in adults worldwide. Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB. Our findings highlight the importance of improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups, and further research on algorithmic fairness, in lung cancer screening.

TL;DR: The study uses neural networks and transfer learning to predict mycotoxin contamination in Irish oat crops, identifying weather history and seed moisture as key predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mycotoxin contamination risks crop quality and food safety, prompting the need for accurate prediction models to enable early intervention.

Method: Five models (MLP, MLP with pre-training, TabPFN, TabNet, FT-Transformer) were evaluated using regression and classification metrics on Irish oat data.

Result: TabPFN performed best, followed by baseline MLP. Weather history and seed moisture were the most influential predictors.

Conclusion: Transfer learning models, especially TabPFN, are effective for mycotoxin prediction, with weather history being critical.

Abstract: Mycotoxin contamination poses a significant risk to cereal crop quality, food safety, and agricultural productivity. Accurate prediction of mycotoxin levels can support early intervention strategies and reduce economic losses. This study investigates the use of neural networks and transfer learning models to predict mycotoxin contamination in Irish oat crops as a multi-response prediction task. Our dataset comprises oat samples collected in Ireland, containing a mix of environmental, agronomic, and geographical predictors. Five modelling approaches were evaluated: a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP), an MLP with pre-training, and three transfer learning models; TabPFN, TabNet, and FT-Transformer. Model performance was evaluated using regression (RMSE, $R^2$) and classification (AUC, F1) metrics, with results reported per toxin and on average. Additionally, permutation-based variable importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential predictors across both prediction tasks. The transfer learning approach TabPFN provided the overall best performance, followed by the baseline MLP. Our variable importance analysis revealed that weather history patterns in the 90-day pre-harvest period were the most important predictors, alongside seed moisture content.

*Bhaktipriya Radharapu,Eshika Saxena,Kenneth Li,Chenxi Whitehouse,Adina Williams,Nicola Cancedda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probes trained with Brier score-based loss offer efficient and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for LLM judges, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based judges need efficient and accurate uncertainty estimates for production use, but current methods are either poorly calibrated or costly.

Method: Linear probes trained with Brier score-based loss extract calibrated uncertainty from hidden states without additional model training.

Result: Probes achieve better calibration, computational efficiency (~10x savings), and generalize well to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Interpretability-based uncertainty estimation is a practical solution for LLM judges, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: As LLM-based judges become integral to industry applications, obtaining well-calibrated uncertainty estimates efficiently has become critical for production deployment. However, existing techniques, such as verbalized confidence and multi-generation methods, are often either poorly calibrated or computationally expensive. We introduce linear probes trained with a Brier score-based loss to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates from reasoning judges' hidden states, requiring no additional model training. We evaluate our approach on both objective tasks (reasoning, mathematics, factuality, coding) and subjective human preference judgments. Our results demonstrate that probes achieve superior calibration compared to existing methods with $\approx10$x computational savings, generalize robustly to unseen evaluation domains, and deliver higher accuracy on high-confidence predictions. However, probes produce conservative estimates that underperform on easier datasets but may benefit safety-critical deployments prioritizing low false-positive rates. Overall, our work demonstrates that interpretability-based uncertainty estimation provides a practical and scalable plug-and-play solution for LLM judges in production.

### [261] [The Affine Divergence: Aligning Activation Updates Beyond Normalisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22247)
*George Bird*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a mismatch between ideal and effective activation updates during gradient descent, proposing corrective solutions that incidentally derive normalization from first principles. It introduces "PatchNorm" as an alternative to traditional normalization, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activations are closer to the loss and carry sample-dependent information, making them impactful for optimization. However, their updates don't follow the steepest-descent step, prompting corrective measures.

Method: Solutions include trivial corrections leading to normalization and the introduction of "PatchNorm," a functionally distinct normalizer for convolutions. Activation-function-like maps with parameterized scaling are proposed.

Result: The proposed methods outperform traditional normalization techniques across several tests, offering validated new functions.

Conclusion: The work reframes normalization mechanistically, questions the affine + nonlinear approach, and provides empirically successful alternatives.

Abstract: A systematic mismatch exists between mathematically ideal and effective activation updates during gradient descent. As intended, parameters update in their direction of steepest descent. However, activations are argued to constitute a more directly impactful quantity to prioritise in optimisation, as they are closer to the loss in the computational graph and carry sample-dependent information through the network. Yet their propagated updates do not take the optimal steepest-descent step. These quantities exhibit non-ideal sample-wise scaling across affine, convolutional, and attention layers. Solutions to correct for this are trivial and, entirely incidentally, derive normalisation from first principles despite motivational independence. Consequently, such considerations offer a fresh and conceptual reframe of normalisation's action, with auxiliary experiments bolstering this mechanistically. Moreover, this analysis makes clear a second possibility: a solution that is functionally distinct from modern normalisations, without scale-invariance, yet remains empirically successful, outperforming conventional normalisers across several tests. This is presented as an alternative to the affine map. This generalises to convolution via a new functional form, "PatchNorm", a compositionally inseparable normaliser. Together, these provide an alternative mechanistic framework that adds to, and counters some of, the discussion of normalisation. Further, it is argued that normalisers are better decomposed into activation-function-like maps with parameterised scaling, thereby aiding the prioritisation of representations during optimisation. Overall, this constitutes a theoretical-principled approach that yields several new functions that are empirically validated and raises questions about the affine + nonlinear approach to model creation.

*Rohit Pandey,Rohan Pandey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simulation-based neural network method predicts aerodynamic parameters for model rockets using synthetic data, achieving accurate apogee predictions without real flight training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for predicting rocket flight performance are either computationally expensive or require costly real flight data. This work aims to bridge the gap using synthetic data and neural networks.

Method: The approach trains a neural network on synthetic flight data from a physics simulator and applies it to real flights without fine-tuning. It predicts drag and thrust factors from apogee measurements and motor/config features.

Result: Evaluated on 8 real flights, the method achieved a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction, outperforming OpenRocket baselines.

Conclusion: The method shows promising sim-to-real transfer with zero real training data, though a systematic bias highlights the physics-real world gap. Public implementation encourages community adoption.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of model rocket flight performance requires estimating aerodynamic parameters that are difficult to measure directly. Traditional approaches rely on computational fluid dynamics or empirical correlations, while data-driven methods require extensive real flight data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. We present a simulation-based amortized inference approach that trains a neural network on synthetic flight data generated from a physics simulator, then applies the learned model to real flights without any fine-tuning. Our method learns to invert the forward physics model, directly predicting drag coefficient and thrust correction factor from a single apogee measurement combined with motor and configuration features. In this proof-of-concept study, we train on 10,000 synthetic flights and evaluate on 8 real flights, achieving a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction - demonstrating promising sim-to-real transfer with zero real training examples. Analysis reveals a systematic positive bias in predictions, providing quantitative insight into the gap between idealized physics and real-world flight conditions. We additionally compare against OpenRocket baseline predictions, showing that our learned approach reduces apogee prediction error. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and adoption in the amateur rocketry community.

### [263] [Temporal Visual Semantics-Induced Human Motion Understanding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22249)
*Zheng Xing,Weibing Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel unsupervised human motion segmentation (HMS) method by integrating temporal vision semantics (TVS) extracted via LLM into subspace clustering, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subspace clustering methods for HMS ignore temporal semantic exploration. This paper aims to leverage LLM-derived TVS to enhance clustering performance.

Method: Extracts textual motion info from frames using LLM, integrates TVS into subspace clustering, and introduces temporal constraints and feedback for optimization.

Result: The method achieves superior performance on four benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Incorporating TVS via LLM and temporal constraints significantly improves HMS, demonstrating the potential of semantic exploration in subspace clustering.

Abstract: Unsupervised human motion segmentation (HMS) can be effectively achieved using subspace clustering techniques. However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.

*Pascal Passigan,Kevin zhu,Angelina Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework integrating multimodal embeddings into a biomedical knowledge graph to predict gene expression changes caused by drugs, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to uncover mechanistic insights into how small molecules affect gene expression, beyond simple binary drug-disease associations.

Method: The authors construct a merged biomedical graph combining PrimeKG++ and LINCS L1000 data, initialized with multimodal embeddings. They train a graph attention network (GAT) to predict gene expression changes.

Result: The framework performs better than MLP baselines under scaffold and random splits, with ablation studies confirming the importance of biomedical KG edges.

Conclusion: This approach advances mechanistic drug modeling by predicting transcriptional effects, offering insights beyond traditional drug-disease associations.

Abstract: Understanding how small molecules perturb gene expression is essential for uncovering drug mechanisms, predicting off-target effects, and identifying repurposing opportunities. While prior deep learning frameworks have integrated multimodal embeddings into biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) and further improved these representations through graph neural network message-passing paradigms, these models have been applied to tasks such as link prediction and binary drug-disease association, rather than the task of gene perturbation, which may unveil more about mechanistic transcriptomic effects. To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits. Ablation experiments with edge shuffling and node feature randomization further demonstrate that the edges provided by biomedical KGs enhance perturbation-level prediction. More broadly, our framework provides a path toward mechanistic drug modeling: moving beyond binary drug-disease association tasks to granular transcriptional effects of therapeutic intervention.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAATNet, a novel Graph Attention Adaptive Transfer Network, to address challenges in link prediction (LP) with GNNs, especially for large-scale sparse graphs and transfer learning. It combines pre-training and fine-tuning with innovative strategies for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based LP methods struggle with large-scale sparse graphs and dataset alignment in transfer learning. Self-supervised methods have been successful but overlook transfer learning's potential across datasets.

Method: GAATNet combines pre-training and fine-tuning to capture global node embeddings. It includes strategies like distant neighbor embeddings for global features and a lightweight self-adapter module for efficiency.

Result: Experiments on seven datasets show GAATNet achieves state-of-the-art LP performance, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer and scalability.

Conclusion: GAATNet provides a scalable solution integrating GNNs and transfer learning for LP tasks, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have brought revolutionary advancements to the field of link prediction (LP), providing powerful tools for mining potential relationships in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when dealing with large-scale sparse graphs and the need for a high degree of alignment between different datasets in transfer learning. Besides, although self-supervised methods have achieved remarkable success in many graph tasks, prior research has overlooked the potential of transfer learning to generalize across different graph datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Graph Attention Adaptive Transfer Network (GAATNet). It combines the advantages of pre-training and fine-tuning to capture global node embedding information across datasets of different scales, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer and improved LP performance. To enhance the model's generalization ability and accelerate training, we design two key strategies: 1) Incorporate distant neighbor embeddings as biases in the self-attention module to capture global features. 2) Introduce a lightweight self-adapter module during fine-tuning to improve training efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that GAATNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in LP tasks. This study provides a general and scalable solution for LP tasks to effectively integrate GNNs with transfer learning.

*Daniil Burakov,Ivan Petrov,Dmitrii Khelimskii,Ivan Bessonov,Mikhail Lazarev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study develops a predictive model for cardiac death post-PCI using real and synthetic data, identifies key mortality factors, and evaluates model performance with and without oversampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prediction of cardiac death after PCI by addressing class imbalance and identifying influential factors using machine learning.

Method: Analyzed 2,044 PCI patients, generated 500 synthetic samples for imbalance correction, applied multiple ML models, and used permutation feature importance for analysis.

Result: Models achieved high accuracy (0.92-0.93) but ignored minority class without oversampling. Augmentation improved minority-class recall and identified Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease as key features.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation enhances model robustness for imbalanced clinical prediction, advocating routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests.

Abstract: Patient status, angiographic and procedural characteristics encode crucial signals for predicting long-term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiac death based on the real and synthetic data of patients undergoing PCI and to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on mortality. We analyzed 2,044 patients, who underwent a PCI for bifurcation lesions. The primary outcome was cardiac death at 3-year follow-up. Several machine learning models were applied to predict three-year mortality after PCI. To address class imbalance and improve the representation of the minority class, an additional 500 synthetic samples were generated and added to the training set. To evaluate the contribution of individual features to model performance, we applied permutation feature importance. An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate how the model's predictions would change after removing non-informative features from the training and test datasets. Without oversampling, all models achieve high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93), yet they almost completely ignore the minority class. Across models, augmentation consistently increases minority-class recall with minimal loss of AUROC, improves probability quality, and yields more clinically reasonable risk estimates on the constructed severe profiles. According to feature importance analysis, four features emerged as the most influential: Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease. These results show that straightforward augmentation with realistic and extreme cases can expose, quantify, and reduce brittleness in imbalanced clinical prediction using only tabular records, and motivate routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests alongside headline metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator, revealing redundant constraints and dominant physical effects on machine learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of physics-constrained data generation in scientific domains where real data are scarce, particularly identifying necessary physical components without over-constraining models.

Method: The study uses a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator, selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise to analyze their impact.

Result: Findings include the redundancy of explicit energy conservation enforcement, dominance of Fabry-Perot oscillations in bandwidth variability, and pitfalls in noise-addition pipelines. The generator operates efficiently at 200 samples per second.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable guidance for physics-informed dataset design and demonstrates machine learning performance as a tool for assessing constraint relevance, highlighting a physics-learnability trade-off.

Abstract: Physics-constrained data generation is essential for machine learning in scientific domains where real data are scarce; however, existing approaches often over-constrain models without identifying which physical components are necessary. We present a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. By selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise, we uncover a physics constraint paradox: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant when the underlying equations are physically consistent, with constrained and unconstrained variants achieving identical conservation accuracy (mean error approximately 7 x 10^-9). In contrast, Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate threshold-based bandwidth variability, accounting for a 72 percent reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed (with bandwidth spread reduced from 132.3 nm to 37.4 nm). We further identify a subtle pitfall: standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization pipelines introduce 0.5 percent unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples per second, enabling high-throughput data generation and remaining orders of magnitude faster than typical full-wave solvers reported in the literature. Finally, downstream machine learning evaluation reveals a clear physics-learnability trade-off: while central wavelength prediction remains unaffected, removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction accuracy by 31.3 percent in R-squared and reduces RMSE by 73.8 percent. These findings provide actionable guidance for physics-informed dataset design and highlight machine learning performance as a diagnostic tool for assessing constraint relevance.

Abstract: PNNs present promising opportunities for accelerating machine learning by leveraging the unique benefits of photonic circuits. However, current state of the art PNN simulation tools face significant scalability challenges when training large-scale PNNs, due to the computational demands of transfer matrix calculations, resulting in high memory and time consumption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Slicing method, an efficient transfer matrix computation approach compatible with back-propagation. We integrate this method into LuxIA, a unified simulation and training framework. The Slicing method substantially reduces memory usage and execution time, enabling scalable simulation and training of large PNNs. Experimental evaluations across various photonic architectures and standard datasets, including MNIST, Digits, and Olivetti Faces, show that LuxIA consistently surpasses existing tools in speed and scalability. Our results advance the state of the art in PNN simulation, making it feasible to explore and optimize larger, more complex architectures. By addressing key computational bottlenecks, LuxIA facilitates broader adoption and accelerates innovation in AI hardware through photonic technologies. This work paves the way for more efficient and scalable photonic neural network research and development.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores LLMs' ability to analyze temporal motifs in dynamic graphs, introduces a benchmark (LLMTM), and proposes a tool-augmented LLM agent with a structure-aware dispatcher to balance cost and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored area of LLMs' capability in temporal motif analysis within dynamic graphs, which is crucial for understanding anomalies and unique phenomena.

Method: The authors create the LLMTM benchmark with six tasks across nine temporal motif types, test various prompting techniques and LLMs, and develop a tool-augmented agent with a structure-aware dispatcher.

Result: The tool-augmented agent achieves high accuracy but at high cost; the structure-aware dispatcher maintains accuracy while reducing costs.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates effective LLM performance in temporal motif tasks and offers a cost-efficient solution through intelligent query dispatching.

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated a growing interest in their capacity for processing dynamic graphs. Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost.

TL;DR: SoDip, a hierarchical stacking optimization framework, improves reproducibility in radiation-induced grafting (RIG) by integrating diverse data types and quantifying uncertainty, outperforming prior models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility in RIG is limited by unreported variability in base-film morphology, leading to inconsistent graft gradients and performance. SoDip addresses this gap.

Method: SoDip combines a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1), TabNet, XGBoost, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM), and Bayesian Optimization to model multimodal data and quantify uncertainty.

Result: SoDip achieves ~33% improvement over GPR in cross-validation, with calibrated confidence intervals identifying low-reproducibility regimes.

Conclusion: SoDip outperforms prior models, integrating sparse textual and numerical inputs to enable reproducible, morphology-aware design in graft polymerization research.

Abstract: Radiation-induced grafting (RIG) enables precise functionalization of polymer films for ion-exchange membranes, CO2-separation membranes, and battery electrolytes by generating radicals on robust substrates to graft desired monomers. However, reproducibility remains limited due to unreported variability in base-film morphology (crystallinity, grain orientation, free volume), which governs monomer diffusion, radical distribution, and the Trommsdorff effect, leading to spatial graft gradients and performance inconsistencies. We present a hierarchical stacking optimization framework with a Dirichlet's Process (SoDip), a hierarchical data-driven framework integrating: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors (irradiation source, grafting type, substrate manufacturer); (2) TabNet and XGBoost for modelling multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for efficient exploration of high-dimensional synthesis space. A diverse dataset was curated using ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer, incorporating numerical and textual variables across hundreds of RIG studies. In cross-validation, SoDip achieved ~33% improvement over GPR while providing calibrated confidence intervals that identify low-reproducibility regimes. Its stacked architecture integrates sparse textual and numerical inputs of varying quality, outperforming prior models and establishing a foundation for reproducible, morphology-aware design in graft polymerization research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Valori introduces deterministic AI memory using fixed-point arithmetic to ensure bit-identical results across platforms, addressing non-determinism in floating-point embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating-point arithmetic in AI systems causes non-determinism, leading to inconsistent memory states and retrieval results across hardware. This hinders replayability and safe deployment, especially in regulated sectors.

Method: Valori replaces floating-point operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine.

Result: Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across different hardware platforms.

Conclusion: Deterministic memory is essential for trustworthy AI systems, and Valori provides a practical solution.

Abstract: Modern AI systems rely on vector embeddings stored and searched using floating-point arithmetic. While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms. We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary. Our results suggest that deterministic memory is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems. The reference implementation is open-source and available at https://github.com/varshith-Git/Valori-Kernel (archived at https://zenodo.org/records/18022660).

TL;DR: DBAW-PIKAN enhances PINNs by addressing gradient-related challenges in multi-scale problems, improving accuracy and convergence without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with multi-scale or high-frequency features due to gradient flow stiffness and spectral bias, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Combines Kolmogorov-Arnold network architecture with adaptive weighting and dynamic decay upper bounds to mitigate gradient issues.

Result: Achieves faster convergence and at least an order of magnitude better accuracy in benchmarks like Klein-Gordon, Burgers, and Helmholtz equations.

Conclusion: DBAW-PIKAN effectively overcomes PINNs' limitations, offering superior performance in accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have led to significant advancements in scientific computing by integrating fundamental physical principles with advanced data-driven techniques. However, when dealing with problems characterized by multi-scale or high-frequency features, PINNs encounter persistent and severe challenges related to stiffness in gradient flow and spectral bias, which significantly limit their predictive capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Dynamic Balancing Adaptive Weighting Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (DBAW-PIKAN), designed to mitigate such gradient-related failure modes and overcome the bottlenecks in function representation. The core of DBAW-PIKAN combines the Kolmogorov-Arnold network architecture, based on learnable B-splines, with an adaptive weighting strategy that incorporates a dynamic decay upper bound. Compared to baseline models, the proposed method accelerates the convergence process and improves solution accuracy by at least an order of magnitude without introducing additional computational complexity. A series of numerical benchmarks, including the Klein-Gordon, Burgers, and Helmholtz equations, demonstrate the significant advantages of DBAW-PIKAN in enhancing both accuracy and generalization performance.

*Zikun Guoa,Adeyinka. P. Adedigbaa,Rammohan Mallipeddi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cluster Aggregated GAN, a hybrid framework for generating synthetic appliance data by addressing limitations in existing GAN-based methods, improving realism, diversity, and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled datasets for non-intrusive load monitoring and privacy-preserving energy research motivates the need for better synthetic data generation, as current methods fail to account for behavioral differences between appliance types.

Method: The proposed Cluster Aggregated GAN uses a hybrid approach: intermittent appliances are grouped by clusters with dedicated generators, while continuous appliances are handled by an LSTM-based generator with sequence compression for stability.

Result: Experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset show the framework outperforms baselines in realism, diversity, and training stability, with clustering improving interpretability and scalability.

Conclusion: The Cluster Aggregated GAN is an effective solution for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Synthetic appliance data are essential for developing non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms and enabling privacy preserving energy research, yet the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a significant barrier. Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability. These findings establish the proposed framework as an effective approach for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research.

TL;DR: Co-GRPO optimizes Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) by aligning training with inference through a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP), improving generation quality without costly backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the discrepancy between MDM training (single-step BERT-style) and inference (multi-step iterative), which leaves inference schedules unoptimized.

Method: Introduces Co-GRPO, a unified MDP framework combining model and schedule optimization using Group Relative Policy Optimization at trajectory level.

Result: Shows improved generation quality across benchmarks (ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, DPG-Bench).

Conclusion: Co-GRPO effectively bridges the training-inference gap in MDMs, enhancing performance holistically.

Abstract: Recently, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have shown promising potential across vision, language, and cross-modal generation. However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores how algorithmic oversight impacts worker wellbeing and performance, revealing nonmonotonic patterns missed by linear models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the effects of person-centered HR practices under algorithmic management, especially when oversight is unclear or transparent.

Method: Double Machine Learning framework to estimate moderated mediation without restrictive functional forms, using survey data from 464 gig workers.

Result: Supportive HR improves wellbeing, but performance link weakens with unclear algorithmic oversight, strengthening again when oversight is transparent.

Conclusion: Clear rules and credible recourse make strong oversight workable; Double Machine Learning effectively captures nonlinear effects.

Abstract: A central question for the future of work is whether person centered management can survive when algorithms take on managerial roles. Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable. Methodologically, the paper shows how Double Machine Learning can be used to estimate conditional indirect effects in organizational research without forcing the data into a linear shape.

### [276] [Learning from Negative Examples: Why Warning-Framed Training Data Teaches What It Warns Against](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22293)
*Tsogt-Ochir Enkhbayar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Warning-framed training data doesn't teach models to avoid flagged behavior, as models reproduce it similarly to direct exposure. Overlapping latent features and 'stealth slip' prevent differentiation. Training-time feature ablation helps, but co-occurrence dominates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why language models fail to learn from warnings in training data and reproduce warned-against behaviors.

Method: Experiments comparing reproduction rates of flagged content with and without warnings, sparse autoencoder analysis to identify latent feature overlaps, and investigation of 'stealth slip'.

Result: Models reproduced warned content at similar rates (76.7% vs. 83.3%) due to overlapping features (e.g., Feature #8684) and 'stealth slip.' Pragmatic interpretation is overshadowed by statistical co-occurrence.

Conclusion: Current architectures prioritize co-occurrence over understanding warnings. Training-time feature ablation is effective, but models fail to learn 'why' behaviors appear.

Abstract: Warning-framed content in training data (e.g., "DO NOT USE - this code is vulnerable") does not, it turns out, teach language models to avoid the warned-against behavior. In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: "describing X" and "performing X" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call "stealth slip", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context, not why it appeared there.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Mixture of Experts (QMoE) architecture to address limitations in classical MoE models, leveraging quantum routing for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like expert imbalance and computational complexity in classical MoE models by integrating quantum machine learning principles.

Method: A Quantum Gating Network (Router) is combined with classical experts, utilizing quantum feature maps and wave interference for efficient routing.

Result: The Quantum Router outperforms classical routers on non-linearly separable data (e.g., Two Moons dataset) and shows robustness against quantum noise.

Conclusion: The QMoE architecture offers topological advantages and is feasible for near-term quantum hardware, with potential applications in federated and privacy-preserving learning.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling deep learning models, yet it is fundamentally limited by challenges such as expert imbalance and the computational complexity of classical routing mechanisms. This paper investigates the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to address these limitations through a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Mixture of Experts (QMoE) architecture. Specifically, we conduct an ablation study using a Quantum Gating Network (Router) combined with classical experts to isolate the source of quantum advantage. Our central finding validates the Interference Hypothesis: by leveraging quantum feature maps (Angle Embedding) and wave interference, the Quantum Router acts as a high-dimensional kernel method, enabling the modeling of complex, non-linear decision boundaries with superior parameter efficiency compared to its classical counterparts. Experimental results on non-linearly separable data, such as the Two Moons dataset, demonstrate that the Quantum Router achieves a significant topological advantage, effectively "untangling" data distributions that linear classical routers fail to separate efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the architecture's robustness against simulated quantum noise, confirming its feasibility for near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. We discuss practical applications in federated learning, privacy-preserving machine learning, and adaptive systems that could benefit from this quantum-enhanced routing paradigm.

TL;DR: PDx is an MLOps-driven system for credit risk forecasting that addresses limitations of static PD models by integrating continuous monitoring, retraining, and validation through a dynamic lifecycle management approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PD models lack adaptability to changing borrower behavior, leading to degraded performance over time. PDx aims to solve this by enabling continuous model updates and validation.

Method: PDx uses a champion-challenger framework for dynamic model updates, leveraging MLOps for monitoring, retraining, and validation. Decision tree-based ensemble models are employed for better performance.

Result: Empirical analysis shows decision tree ensembles outperform linear models and neural networks but require frequent updates. PDx mitigates value erosion in short-term loans with rapidly shifting borrower behavior.

Conclusion: PDx proves effective and scalable for modern credit risk forecasting, validated across diverse lending datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents PDx, an adaptive, machine learning operations (MLOps) driven decision system for forecasting credit risk using probability of default (PD) modeling in digital lending. While conventional PD models prioritize predictive accuracy during model development with complex machine learning algorithms, they often overlook continuous adaptation to changing borrower behaviour, resulting in static models that degrade over time in production and generate inaccurate default predictions. Many financial institutes also find it difficult transitioning ML models from development environment to production and maintaining their health. With PDx we aimed to addresses these limitations using a dynamic, end-to-end model lifecycle management approach that integrates continuous model monitoring, retraining, and validation through a robust MLOps pipeline. We introduced a dynamic champion-challenger framework for PDx to regularly update baseline models to recalibrate independent parameters with the latest data and select the best-performing model through out-of-time validation, ensuring resilience against data drift and changing credit risk patterns. Our empirical analysis shows that decision tree-based ensemble models consistently outperform others in classifying defaulters but require frequent updates to sustain performance. Linear models (e.g., logistic regression) and neural networks exhibit greater performance degradation. The study demonstrate with PDx we can mitigates value erosion for digital lenders, particularly in short-term, small-ticket loans, where borrower behavior shifts rapidly. We have validated the effectiveness of PDx using datasets from peer-to-peer lending, business loans, and auto loans, demonstrating its scalability and adaptability for modern credit risk forecasting.

TL;DR: LLMBoost is a novel ensemble fine-tuning framework leveraging intermediate LLM states for enhanced performance via cross-model attention, chain training, and near-parallel inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ensemble methods treat LLMs as black boxes, ignoring rich internal representations and interactions. LLMBoost addresses this gap by utilizing intermediate states.

Method: Introduces cross-model attention for hierarchical error correction, chain training for progressive fine-tuning, and near-parallel inference for efficiency.

Result: Demonstrates improved accuracy on commonsense and arithmetic reasoning tasks while reducing inference latency.

Conclusion: LLMBoost provides a theoretically grounded and efficient approach to ensemble learning by leveraging intermediate LLM states.

Abstract: Ensemble learning of LLMs has emerged as a promising alternative to enhance performance, but existing approaches typically treat models as black boxes, combining the inputs or final outputs while overlooking the rich internal representations and interactions across models.In this work, we introduce LLMBoost, a novel ensemble fine-tuning framework that breaks this barrier by explicitly leveraging intermediate states of LLMs. Inspired by the boosting paradigm, LLMBoost incorporates three key innovations. First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation. Third, a near-parallel inference paradigm design pipelines hidden states across models layer by layer, achieving inference efficiency approaching single-model decoding. We further establish the theoretical foundations of LLMBoost, proving that sequential integration guarantees monotonic improvements under bounded correction assumptions. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMBoost consistently boosts accuracy while reducing inference latency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS) for learning threshold policies under fairness constraints, achieving high reward with minimal constraint violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness and service constraints in closed-loop systems with feedback effects, ensuring non-stationary data doesn't amplify disparities.

Method: OFS uses grid-based confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals, selecting thresholds that appear feasible and maximize reward.

Result: OFS outperforms baselines in synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks, achieving near-oracle performance.

Conclusion: OFS is effective for low-dimensional policy classes, balancing fairness and utility while minimizing constraint violations.

Abstract: Closed-loop decision-making systems (e.g., lending, screening, or recidivism risk assessment) often operate under fairness and service constraints while inducing feedback effects: decisions change who appears in the future, yielding non-stationary data and potentially amplifying disparities. We study online learning of a one-dimensional threshold policy from bandit feedback under demographic parity (DP) and, optionally, service-rate constraints. The learner observes only a scalar score each round and selects a threshold; reward and constraint residuals are revealed only for the chosen threshold.
  We propose Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a simple grid-based method that maintains confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals for each candidate threshold. At each round, OFS selects a threshold that appears feasible under confidence bounds and, among those, maximizes optimistic reward; if no threshold appears feasible, OFS selects the threshold minimizing optimistic constraint violation. This design directly targets feasible high-utility thresholds and is particularly effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes where discretization is natural.
  We evaluate OFS on (i) a synthetic closed-loop benchmark with stable contraction dynamics and (ii) two semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks grounded in German Credit and COMPAS, constructed by training a score model and feeding group-dependent acceptance decisions back into population composition. Across all environments, OFS achieves higher reward with smaller cumulative constraint violation than unconstrained and primal-dual bandit baselines, and is near-oracle relative to the best feasible fixed threshold under the same sweep procedure. Experiments are reproducible and organized with double-blind-friendly relative outputs.

TL;DR: LangPrecip integrates meteorological text with radar data to improve short-term precipitation nowcasting, achieving significant gains in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack strong constraints on future motion in precipitation nowcasting, leading to ambiguity.

Method: Proposes LangPrecip, a language-aware framework treating text as semantic motion constraints under Rectified Flow.

Result: Achieves over 60% and 19% gains in heavy-rainfall CSI at 80-minute lead time on Swedish and MRMS datasets.

Conclusion: LangPrecip effectively integrates textual and radar data for more accurate and physically consistent nowcasting.

Abstract: Short-term precipitation nowcasting is an inherently uncertain and under-constrained spatiotemporal forecasting problem, especially for rapidly evolving and extreme weather events. Existing generative approaches rely primarily on visual conditioning, leaving future motion weakly constrained and ambiguous. We propose a language-aware multimodal nowcasting framework(LangPrecip) that treats meteorological text as a semantic motion constraint on precipitation evolution. By formulating nowcasting as a semantically constrained trajectory generation problem under the Rectified Flow paradigm, our method enables efficient and physically consistent integration of textual and radar information in latent space.We further introduce LangPrecip-160k, a large-scale multimodal dataset with 160k paired radar sequences and motion descriptions. Experiments on Swedish and MRMS datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 60 \% and 19\% gains in heavy-rainfall CSI at an 80-minute lead time.

*Chorok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings conflate emerging entities and novel relational contexts due to relation-agnostic variances, leading to poor OOD detection. The paper proposes decomposing uncertainty into semantic and structural components, combining them for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic methods fail to distinguish between emerging entities and novel relational contexts, leading to poor out-of-distribution detection.

Method: Introduces uncertainty decomposition into semantic (entity variance) and structural (entity-relation co-occurrence) components, combining them via learned weights (CAGP).

Result: Achieves 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection, a 60-80 percent improvement over baselines, and reduces selective prediction errors by 43 percent at 85 percent answer rate.

Conclusion: Combining semantic and structural uncertainty outperforms relation-agnostic methods, proving their non-redundancy and effectiveness.

Abstract: Probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings represent entities as distributions, using learned variances to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone. Our method (CAGP) combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights, achieving 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks, a 60-80 percent relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. Empirical validation confirms complete frequency overlap on three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10). On selective prediction, our method reduces errors by 43 percent at 85 percent answer rate.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing Bitcoin's extreme volatility and non-stationarity, the paper seeks to enhance forecasting by leveraging macroeconomic indicators.

Method: Uses TimeXer-Exog, a liquidity-conditioned model, compared against LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and univariate TimeXer.

Result: TimeXer-Exog achieves MSE 1.08e8 at a 70-day horizon, outperforming baselines by 89%.

Conclusion: Global liquidity conditioning significantly improves long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasts.

Abstract: Bitcoin price forecasting is characterized by extreme volatility and non-stationarity, often defying traditional univariate time-series models over long horizons. This paper addresses a critical gap by integrating Global M2 Liquidity, aggregated from 18 major economies, as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag structure. Using the TimeXer architecture, we compare a liquidity-conditioned forecasting model (TimeXer-Exog) against state-of-the-art benchmarks including LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and a standard univariate TimeXer. Experiments conducted on daily Bitcoin price data from January 2020 to August 2025 demonstrate that explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon forecasts. At a 70-day forecast horizon, the proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent. These results highlight that conditioning deep learning models on global liquidity provides substantial improvements in long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasting.

*Matthew Riemer,Erik Miehling,Miao Liu,Djallel Bouneffouf,Murray Campbell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient methods like LoRA can degrade model capabilities during fine-tuning, but small training tweaks, including regularization and replay, mitigate this while preserving general knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue where LoRA-based fine-tuning can harm model capabilities and seeks solutions to maintain performance without excessive overhead.

Method: The authors propose a regularized approximate replay approach, penalizing KL divergence from the initial model and interleaving next-token prediction data from a similar corpus.

Result: Applied to Qwen models, this method preserves general knowledge and task plasticity with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Small adjustments in training procedures can effectively prevent catastrophic degradation in parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, only modify a small subset of parameters, they can have a significant impact on the model. Our instruction-tuning experiments show that LoRA-based supervised fine-tuning can catastrophically degrade model capabilities, even when trained on very small datasets for relatively few steps. With that said, we demonstrate that while the most straightforward approach (that is likely the most used in practice) fails spectacularly, small tweaks to the training procedure with very little overhead can virtually eliminate the problem. Particularly, in this paper we consider a regularized approximate replay approach which penalizes KL divergence with respect to the initial model and interleaves in data for next token prediction from a different, yet similar, open access corpus to what was used in pre-training. When applied to Qwen instruction-tuned models, we find that this recipe preserves general knowledge in the model without hindering plasticity to new tasks by adding a modest amount of computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper extends neural network parameterisations like μP by introducing CompleteP(d) for unified scaling in width, depth, batch-size, and training duration, and investigates per-module hyperparameter transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hyperparameter transfer across model sizes and address scalability issues, extending existing methods like μP.

Method: Proposes CompleteP(d) parameterisation for unified scaling and explores per-module hyperparameter optimisation.

Result: Demonstrates successful hyperparameter transfer even in per-module settings, leading to significant training speed improvements.

Conclusion: Proper parameterisation enables effective hyperparameter transfer across model sizes and modules, enhancing training efficiency.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning can dramatically impact training stability and final performance of large-scale models. Recent works on neural network parameterisations, such as $μ$P, have enabled transfer of optimal global hyperparameters across model sizes. These works propose an empirical practice of search for optimal global base hyperparameters at a small model size, and transfer to a large size. We extend these works in two key ways. To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem. We demonstrate that, with the right parameterisation, hyperparameter transfer holds even in the per-module hyperparameter regime. Our study covers an extensive range of optimisation hyperparameters of modern models: learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, and residual block multipliers. Our experiments demonstrate significant training speed improvements in Large Language Models with the transferred per-module hyperparameters.

TL;DR: BLISS is a dynamic sampling strategy for GNNs that uses multi-armed bandits to adaptively select important nodes, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large graphs pose computational challenges for GNNs due to memory and processing bottlenecks from neighbor sampling.

Method: Introduces BLISS, leveraging multi-armed bandits to dynamically sample nodes, balancing exploration and exploitation for better coverage.

Result: BLISS matches or surpasses full-batch training accuracy while being more efficient.

Conclusion: BLISS offers a versatile, adaptive solution for scalable and accurate GNN training.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, but their application to large graphs is hindered by computational costs. The need to process every neighbor for each node creates memory and computational bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce BLISS, a Bandit Layer Importance Sampling Strategy. It uses multi-armed bandits to dynamically select the most informative nodes at each layer, balancing exploration and exploitation to ensure comprehensive graph coverage. Unlike existing static sampling methods, BLISS adapts to evolving node importance, leading to more informed node selection and improved performance. It demonstrates versatility by integrating with both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), adapting its selection policy to their specific aggregation mechanisms. Experiments show that BLISS maintains or exceeds the accuracy of full-batch training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRC is a causality-inspired residual correction framework designed to improve forecasting accuracy safely, preventing performance degradation through structured safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing residual correction methods are greedy and can overcorrect reliable predictions, causing local failures in unseen scenarios. CRC addresses this safety gap.

Method: CRC uses a causality-inspired encoder to decouple dynamics and a hybrid corrector for residuals, governed by a four-fold safety mechanism to prevent harmful updates.

Result: CRC consistently improves accuracy across datasets and ensures high non-degradation rates (NDR) via its safety mechanisms.

Conclusion: CRC is a reliable framework for safe and accurate residual correction in forecasting, suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: While modern multivariate forecasters such as Transformers and GNNs achieve strong benchmark performance, they often suffer from systematic errors at specific variables or horizons and, critically, lack guarantees against performance degradation in deployment. Existing post-hoc residual correction methods attempt to fix these errors, but are inherently greedy: although they may improve average accuracy, they can also "help in the wrong way" by overcorrecting reliable predictions and causing local failures in unseen scenarios.
  To address this critical "safety gap," we propose CRC (Causality-inspired Safe Residual Correction), a plug-and-play framework explicitly designed to ensure non-degradation. CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates.
  Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment.

TL;DR: AFA-LoRA enhances LoRA by introducing non-linear expressivity while retaining mergeability, reducing the gap between LoRA and full-parameter training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's linear adaptation limits expressive power, creating a gap between linear and non-linear training.

Method: AFA-LoRA uses an annealed activation function transitioning from non-linear to linear during training.

Result: AFA-LoRA narrows the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training.

Conclusion: AFA-LoRA offers a more powerful and practical parameter-efficient adaptation paradigm.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. However, its linear adaptation process limits its expressive power. This means there is a gap between the expressive power of linear training and non-linear training. To bridge this gap, we propose AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy that brings non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining its seamless mergeability. Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form. We implement our method on supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding. The results show that AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training. This work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the conflicting needs of high accuracy and clear interpretability in OD flow prediction for GIS and urban analytics.

Method: Augments physical mobility baselines (like PPML gravity) with gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis, focusing on physics-grounded and POI-anchored residuals.

Result: Physics-grounded residuals achieve accuracy comparable to tree-based predictors while remaining interpretable; POI-anchored residuals are robust under spatial generalization.

Conclusion: AMBIT offers a reproducible pipeline with rich diagnostics, supporting urban decision-making by blending physical models with interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: Origin-destination (OD) flow prediction remains a core task in GIS and urban analytics, yet practical deployments face two conflicting needs: high accuracy and clear interpretability. This paper develops AMBIT, a gray-box framework that augments physical mobility baselines with interpretable tree models. We begin with a comprehensive audit of classical spatial interaction models on a year-long, hourly NYC taxi OD dataset. The audit shows that most physical models are fragile at this temporal resolution; PPML gravity is the strongest physical baseline, while constrained variants improve when calibrated on full OD margins but remain notably weaker. We then build residual learners on top of physical baselines using gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis, demonstrating that (i) physics-grounded residuals approach the accuracy of a strong tree-based predictor while retaining interpretable structure, and (ii) POI-anchored residuals are consistently competitive and most robust under spatial generalization. We provide a reproducible pipeline, rich diagnostics, and spatial error analysis designed for urban decision-making.

*Jong-Ik Park,Shreyas Chaudhari,Srinivasa Pranav,Carlee Joe-Wong,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLUE, a gradient-free method, learns to blend expert models efficiently for domain expansion, outperforming heuristic and backpropagation-based methods in accuracy and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for generalized models beyond specialist domains drives the development of GLUE, addressing inefficiencies in prior blending methods.

Method: GLUE learns mixture coefficients via a gradient-free two-point (SPSA) update, requiring only two forward passes per step.

Result: GLUE improves test accuracy by up to 9.1% over baselines and matches or outperforms full-gradient mixing.

Conclusion: GLUE offers an efficient and accurate solution for unifying expert models in domain expansion tasks.

Abstract: In many deployed systems (multilingual ASR, cross-hospital imaging, region-specific perception), multiple pretrained specialist models coexist. Yet, new target domains often require domain expansion: a generalized model that performs well beyond any single specialist's domain. Given such a new target domain, prior works seek a single strong initialization prior for the model parameters by first blending expert models to initialize a target model. However, heuristic blending -- using coefficients based on data size or proxy metrics -- often yields lower target-domain test accuracy, and learning the coefficients on the target loss typically requires computationally-expensive full backpropagation through the network. We propose GLUE, Gradient-free Learning To Unify Experts, which initializes the target model as a convex combination of fixed experts, learning the mixture coefficients of this combination via a gradient-free two-point (SPSA) update that requires only two forward passes per step. Across experiments on three datasets and three network architectures, GLUE produces a single prior that can be fine-tuned effectively to outperform baselines. GLUE improves test accuracy by up to 8.5% over data-size weighting and by up to 9.1% over proxy-metric selection. GLUE either outperforms backpropagation-based full-gradient mixing or matches its performance within 1.4%.

### [291] [The Bayesian Geometry of Transformer Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22471)
*Naman Aggarwal,Siddhartha R. Dalal,Vishal Misra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers perform Bayesian reasoning accurately in controlled settings ('Bayesian wind tunnels'), unlike MLPs, revealing architectural advantages and mechanisms like geometric updates and attention routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to rigorously verify whether transformers perform Bayesian reasoning, addressing gaps in natural data and memorization issues by using controlled environments.

Method: Constructs 'Bayesian wind tunnels' with known true posteriors to test small transformers and MLPs on tasks like bijection elimination and HMM state tracking. Analyzes geometric mechanisms like residual streams and attention patterns.

Result: Transformers achieve high accuracy (10^-3--10^-4 bits) in Bayesian reasoning, while MLPs fail. Reveals consistent geometric mechanisms for inference, such as residual streams as belief substrates and attention for routing.

Conclusion: Transformers inherently implement Bayesian inference via hierarchical attention and geometric design, validated by controlled experiments. Bayesian wind tunnels bridge small-scale verification to large-model reasoning phenomena.

Abstract: Transformers often appear to perform Bayesian reasoning in context, but verifying this rigorously has been impossible: natural data lack analytic posteriors, and large models conflate reasoning with memorization. We address this by constructing \emph{Bayesian wind tunnels} -- controlled environments where the true posterior is known in closed form and memorization is provably impossible. In these settings, small transformers reproduce Bayesian posteriors with \mbox{$10^{-3}$--$10^{-4}$} bit accuracy, while capacity-matched MLPs fail by orders of magnitude, establishing a clear architectural separation.
  Across two tasks -- bijection elimination and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state tracking -- we find that transformers implement Bayesian inference through a consistent geometric mechanism: residual streams serve as the belief substrate, feed-forward networks perform the posterior update, and attention provides content-addressable routing. Geometric diagnostics reveal orthogonal key bases, progressive query--key alignment, and a low-dimensional value manifold parameterized by posterior entropy. During training this manifold unfurls while attention patterns remain stable, a \emph{frame--precision dissociation} predicted by recent gradient analyses.
  Taken together, these results demonstrate that hierarchical attention realizes Bayesian inference by geometric design, explaining both the necessity of attention and the failure of flat architectures. Bayesian wind tunnels provide a foundation for mechanistically connecting small, verifiable systems to reasoning phenomena observed in large language models.

TL;DR: The study introduces a collaborative Boosting model for multiclass imbalance, integrating noise-resistant weight updates and dynamic sampling for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored collaboration between imbalanced learning and model training, which limits performance gains.

Method: Proposes a Boosting model with noise-resistant weight updates and dynamic sampling, integrating density and confidence factors.

Result: Outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines on 20 imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: The model successfully achieves collaborative optimization, enhancing performance in imbalanced learning scenarios.

Abstract: Numerous studies attempt to mitigate classification bias caused by class imbalance. However, existing studies have yet to explore the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training. This constraint hinders further performance improvements. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a collaborative optimization Boosting model of multiclass imbalanced learning. This model is simple but effective by integrating the density factor and the confidence factor, this study designs a noise-resistant weight update mechanism and a dynamic sampling strategy. Rather than functioning as independent components, these modules are tightly integrated to orchestrate weight updates, sample region partitioning, and region-guided sampling. Thus, this study achieves the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training. Extensive experiments on 20 public imbalanced datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines.

*Hassan Wasswa,Timothy Lynar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that avoids continuous retraining by using latent-space representations and graph neural networks, maintaining performance under concept drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-based IoT threat detection relies on static datasets, leading to computational overhead and catastrophic forgetting when dealing with dynamic IoT traffic.

Method: Trains a classifier on historical traffic's latent-space, uses an alignment model for incoming traffic, and employs graph neural networks for classification.

Result: Demonstrates robust detection performance under concept drift on real-world IoT traffic datasets.

Conclusion: The framework is practical for dynamic and large-scale IoT environments, eliminating the need for continuous retraining.

Abstract: Although AI-based models have achieved high accuracy in IoT threat detection, their deployment in enterprise environments is constrained by reliance on stationary datasets that fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world IoT NetFlow traffic, which is frequently affected by concept drift. Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks. To capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, the low-dimensional latent representations are further transformed into a graph-structured format and classified using a graph neural network. Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical deployment in dynamic and large-scale IoT environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) applies to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via LoRA, revealing sparse subnetworks that perform as well as dense ones. The study proposes Partial-LoRA, reducing parameters by 87% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LTH extends to PEFT, specifically LoRA, and to develop efficient fine-tuning methods.

Method: Investigates sparse subnetworks in LoRA, finding their effectiveness depends on sparsity per layer. Proposes Partial-LoRA for systematic identification and training of task-relevant sparse adapters.

Result: Partial-LoRA reduces trainable parameters by up to 87% while matching or improving performance across 20 vision and language tasks.

Conclusion: The findings enhance theoretical understanding of transfer learning and offer efficient adaptation strategies.

Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests that over-parameterized neural networks contain sparse subnetworks ("winning tickets") capable of matching full model performance when trained from scratch. With the growing reliance on fine-tuning large pretrained models, we investigate whether LTH extends to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), specifically focusing on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods. Our key finding is that LTH holds within LoRAs, revealing sparse subnetworks that can match the performance of dense adapters. In particular, we find that the effectiveness of sparse subnetworks depends more on how much sparsity is applied in each layer than on the exact weights included in the subnetwork. Building on this insight, we propose Partial-LoRA, a method that systematically identifies said subnetworks and trains sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces of the pre-trained model. Experiments across 8 vision and 12 language tasks in both single-task and multi-task settings show that Partial-LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to 87\%, while maintaining or improving accuracy. Our results not only deepen our theoretical understanding of transfer learning and the interplay between pretraining and fine-tuning but also open new avenues for developing more efficient adaptation strategies.

*Lucky Susanto,Anasta Pranawijayana,Cortino Sukotjo,Soni Prasad,Derry Wijaya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores predicting the correctness of LLM responses in high-stakes domains like healthcare, using metadata and hallucination signals. It tests GPT-4o and OSS-120B on a prosthodontics exam, showing metadata can improve accuracy but isn't reliable for hallucination prediction. Prompting strategies affect model behavior but not overall accuracy. Results are promising but not robust for critical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored problem of predicting LLM correctness in high-stakes domains, where factual errors (hallucinations) pose significant risks.

Method: Researchers analyzed GPT-4o and OSS-120B on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam, using metadata and hallucination signals across three prompting strategies to build correctness predictors.

Result: Metadata improved accuracy by up to 7.14% and achieved 83.12% precision over a baseline. Hallucination signals were strong indicators of incorrectness, but metadata alone couldn't reliably predict hallucinations. Prompting strategies altered model behavior without affecting accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for developing LLM reliability signals but isn't yet robust enough for critical deployment, highlighting the need for further refinement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and medical education, where the risk of generating factually incorrect (i.e., hallucinated) information is a major concern. While significant efforts have been made to detect and mitigate such hallucinations, predicting whether an LLM's response is correct remains a critical yet underexplored problem. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair. Our findings demonstrate that this metadata-based approach can improve accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieve a precision of 83.12% over a baseline that assumes all answers are correct. We further show that while actual hallucination is a strong indicator of incorrectness, metadata signals alone are not reliable predictors of hallucination. Finally, we reveal that prompting strategies, despite not affecting overall accuracy, significantly alter the models' internal behaviors and the predictive utility of their metadata. These results present a promising direction for developing reliability signals in LLMs but also highlight that the methods explored in this paper are not yet robust enough for critical, high-stakes deployment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to decompose task vectors into shared and unique components, enabling precise control over concept manipulation in large models across image classification, diffusion models, and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting large pre-trained models effectively for specific behaviors remains challenging, especially when combining task vectors leads to unpredictable outcomes due to overlapping concepts.

Method: A principled decomposition method separates task vectors into shared knowledge and unique task-specific components, using invariant subspaces for precise control.

Result: Improved multi-task merging in image classification (5%), clean style mixing in diffusion models, and 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving general performance.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition framework enhances understanding and control of task vector arithmetic, addressing limitations in model editing operations.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have transformed machine learning, yet adapting these models effectively to exhibit precise, concept-specific behaviors remains a significant challenge. Task vectors, defined as the difference between fine-tuned and pre-trained model parameters, provide a mechanism for steering neural networks toward desired behaviors. This has given rise to large repositories dedicated to task vectors tailored for specific behaviors. The arithmetic operation of these task vectors allows for the seamless combination of desired behaviors without the need for large datasets. However, these vectors often contain overlapping concepts that can interfere with each other during arithmetic operations, leading to unpredictable outcomes. We propose a principled decomposition method that separates each task vector into two components: one capturing shared knowledge across multiple task vectors, and another isolating information unique to each specific task. By identifying invariant subspaces across projections, our approach enables more precise control over concept manipulation without unintended amplification or diminution of other behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our decomposition method across three domains: improving multi-task merging in image classification by 5% using shared components as additional task vectors, enabling clean style mixing in diffusion models without generation degradation by mixing only the unique components, and achieving 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving performance on general knowledge tasks by negating the toxic information isolated to the unique component. Our approach provides a new framework for understanding and controlling task vector arithmetic, addressing fundamental limitations in model editing operations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ASSG and SA-PGD to improve gradient accuracy and attack stability for evaluating SNN adversarial robustness, revealing current SNNs' robustness is overestimated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unreliable adversarial robustness evaluation in SNNs due to vanishing gradients caused by binary spike activations.

Method: Introduces Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG) for better gradient accuracy and Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD) for stable attacks.

Result: ASSG and SA-PGD significantly improve attack success rates, showing current SNN robustness is overestimated.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more reliable evaluation of SNN robustness, calling for better adversarial training methods.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) utilize spike-based activations to mimic the brain's energy-efficient information processing. However, the binary and discontinuous nature of spike activations causes vanishing gradients, making adversarial robustness evaluation via gradient descent unreliable. While improved surrogate gradient methods have been proposed, their effectiveness under strong adversarial attacks remains unclear. We propose a more reliable framework for evaluating SNN adversarial robustness. We theoretically analyze the degree of gradient vanishing in surrogate gradients and introduce the Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG), which adaptively evolves the shape of the surrogate function according to the input distribution during attack iterations, thereby enhancing gradient accuracy while mitigating gradient vanishing. In addition, we design an adversarial attack with adaptive step size under the $L_\infty$ constraint-Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD), achieving faster and more stable convergence under imprecise gradients. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially increases attack success rates across diverse adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures and neuron models, providing a more generalized and reliable evaluation of SNN adversarial robustness. The experimental results further reveal that the robustness of current SNNs has been significantly overestimated and highlighting the need for more dependable adversarial training methods.

*Jaebin Lee,Hankook Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimePerceiver is a unified encoder-decoder framework for time-series forecasting that integrates encoding, decoding, and training strategies, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work in time-series forecasting often separates encoder design from prediction and training. TimePerceiver unifies these aspects for better performance.

Method: Proposes a flexible encoder-decoder architecture with latent bottleneck representations for encoding and learnable queries for decoding, handling diverse temporal objectives.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: TimePerceiver provides a comprehensive solution for time-series forecasting, achieving superior results through unified design and training.

Abstract: In machine learning, effective modeling requires a holistic consideration of how to encode inputs, make predictions (i.e., decoding), and train the model. However, in time-series forecasting, prior work has predominantly focused on encoder design, often treating prediction and training as separate or secondary concerns. In this paper, we propose TimePerceiver, a unified encoder-decoder forecasting framework that is tightly aligned with an effective training strategy. To be specific, we first generalize the forecasting task to include diverse temporal prediction objectives such as extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation. Since this generalization requires handling input and target segments that are arbitrarily positioned along the temporal axis, we design a novel encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly perceive and adapt to these varying positions. For encoding, we introduce a set of latent bottleneck representations that can interact with all input segments to jointly capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies. For decoding, we leverage learnable queries corresponding to target timestamps to effectively retrieve relevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of benchmark datasets.

*Taeyun Kim*

TL;DR: Rank-based input normalization lacks formal stability criteria; existing methods fail due to design flaws. Proposed axioms ensure invariance and stability, leading to a new operator adhering to these principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of formal structural conditions ensuring stability in rank-based normalization under common invariances like monotone transformations and batch variations.

Method: Propose three axioms for invariance and stability, prove necessity of factorization into rank representation and monotone Lipschitz map, and construct a minimal operator meeting these.

Result: Existing differentiable sorting/ranking operators fail stability criteria due to design flaws; proposed operator satisfies axioms and shows empirical validity.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the design space for rank-based normalization, distinguishing it from existing methods and providing a stable, axiom-adherent alternative.

Abstract: Rank-based input normalization is a workhorse of modern machine learning, prized for its robustness to scale, monotone transformations, and batch-to-batch variation. In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down.
  We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices.
  To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups. Together, our results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods.

TL;DR: This study analyzes 2,500+ AV crash records using K-means clustering and ARM to identify crash patterns and contributors, offering insights for safer AV deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AV safety concerns persist despite their potential benefits, with limited research on crash trends across automation levels.

Method: A two-stage approach: K-means clusters crash records, then ARM extracts multivariate relationships among crash factors.

Result: Identified 4 behavioral clusters and key contributors like lighting, surface, and vehicle dynamics influencing crash patterns.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for AV developers and policymakers to enhance safety and reduce crash risks.

Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AV) hold potential to reduce or eliminate human driving errors, enhance traffic safety, and support sustainable mobility. Recently, crash data has increasingly revealed that AV behavior can deviate from expected safety outcomes, raising concerns about the technology's safety and operational reliability in mixed traffic environments. While past research has investigated AV crash, most studies rely on small-size California-centered datasets, with a limited focus on understanding crash trends across various SAE Levels of automation. This study analyzes over 2,500 AV crash records from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), covering SAE Levels 2 and 4, to uncover underlying crash dynamics. A two-stage data mining framework is developed. K-means clustering is first applied to segment crash records into 4 distinct behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors. Then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used to extract interpretable multivariate relationships between crash patterns and crash contributors including lighting conditions, surface condition, vehicle dynamics, and environmental conditions within each cluster. These insights provide actionable guidance for AV developers, safety regulators, and policymakers in formulating AV deployment strategies and minimizing crash risks.

TL;DR: EnFlow unifies flow matching and energy modeling to improve molecular conformer generation and ground-state identification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with minimal computational steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-based pipelines for generating low-energy conformer ensembles are computationally expensive, and current learning-based approaches lack integration between diversity and energy accuracy.

Method: EnFlow combines flow matching with an explicitly learned energy model, using energy-guided sampling along a non-Gaussian FM path to steer trajectories toward lower-energy regions.

Result: EnFlow enhances conformational fidelity in few-step regimes and improves generation metrics and ground-state prediction accuracy on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs datasets.

Conclusion: EnFlow offers a unified, efficient solution for molecular conformer generation and ground-state identification, surpassing existing methods.

Abstract: Generating low-energy conformer ensembles and identifying ground-state conformations from molecular graphs remain computationally demanding with physics-based pipelines. Current learning-based approaches often suffer from a fragmented paradigm: generative models capture diversity but lack reliable energy calibration, whereas deterministic predictors target a single structure and fail to represent ensemble variability. Here we present EnFlow, a unified framework that couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model through an energy-guided sampling scheme defined along a non-Gaussian FM path. By incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling, our method steers trajectories toward lower-energy regions, substantially improving conformational fidelity, particularly in the few-step regime. The learned energy function further enables efficient energy-based ranking of generated ensembles for accurate ground-state identification. Extensive experiments on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs demonstrate that EnFlow simultaneously improves generation metrics with 1--2 ODE-steps and reduces ground-state prediction errors compared with state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency price forecasting is crucial for investors, but existing methods lack accuracy or efficiency. This paper introduces PGRU to address these limitations.

Method: PGRU uses parallel recurrent neural networks with distinct price-related features as inputs, combining their outputs via another neural network for prediction.

Result: The model achieves MAPE scores of 3.243% and 2.641% for window lengths 20 and 15, respectively, showing improved accuracy and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: PGRU offers a superior approach for cryptocurrency price prediction, combining accuracy, efficiency, and reduced data requirements.

Abstract: According to the advent of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, many investments and businesses are now conducted online through cryptocurrencies. Among them, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to make transactions secure, transparent, traceable, and immutable. It also exhibits significant price fluctuations and performance, which has attracted substantial attention, especially in financial sectors. Consequently, a wide range of investors and individuals have turned to investing in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most important challenges in economics is price forecasting for future trades. Cryptocurrencies are no exception, and investors are looking for methods to predict prices; various theories and methods have been proposed in this field. This paper presents a new deep model, called \emph{Parallel Gated Recurrent Units} (PGRU), for cryptocurrency price prediction. In this model, recurrent neural networks forecast prices in a parallel and independent way. The parallel networks utilize different inputs, each representing distinct price-related features. Finally, the outputs of the parallel networks are combined by a neural network to forecast the future price of cryptocurrencies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.243% and 2.641% for window lengths 20 and 15, respectively. Our method therefore attains higher accuracy and efficiency with fewer input data and lower computational cost compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting of the gold market is challenging due to its complexity and economic-political influences. A reliable model benefits developers and investors.

Method: Uses two LSTM networks for daily and monthly forecasts, integrated via an MLP network. GWO optimizes neuron counts based on RMSE.

Result: Achieved a 171% return in three months with MAE of $0.21 for daily and $22.23 for monthly closing price predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed LSTM-MLP model is effective for gold price forecasting, offering practical trading strategies and high accuracy.

Abstract: The global gold market, by its fundamentals, has long been home to many financial institutions, banks, governments, funds, and micro-investors. Due to the inherent complexity and relationship between important economic and political components, accurate forecasting of financial markets has always been challenging. Therefore, providing a model that can accurately predict the future of the markets is very important and will be of great benefit to their developers. In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for daily and monthly gold forecasting is presented. Two Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are responsible for daily and monthly forecasting, the results of which are integrated into a Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) network and provide the final forecast of the next day prices. The algorithm forecasts the highest, lowest, and closing prices on the daily and monthly time frame. Based on these forecasts, a trading strategy for live market trading was developed, according to which the proposed model had a return of 171% in three months. Also, the number of internal neurons in each network is optimized by the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm based on the least RMSE error. The dataset was collected between 2010 and 2021 and includes data on macroeconomic, energy markets, stocks, and currency status of developed countries. Our proposed LSTM-MLP model predicted the daily closing price of gold with the Mean absolute error (MAE) of $ 0.21 and the next month's price with $ 22.23.

*Tomas Ortega,Chun-Yin Huang,Xiaoxiao Li,Hamid Jafarkhani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new frameworks, CAFe and CAFe-S, to address communication bottlenecks in Federated Learning (FL) by enabling biased compression without compromising privacy or requiring client-side state. These methods outperform existing compression schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce communication costs in FL, especially uplink transmission, without violating privacy or relying on client-specific states.

Method: Two frameworks are proposed: CAFe uses aggregated updates as shared control variates, while CAFe-S leverages a server's private dataset for better accuracy. Both are analyzed using Distributed Gradient Descent.

Result: Analytical proofs show CAFe's superiority over DCGD with biased compression, and CAFe-S converges faster with more representative server data. Experiments confirm their effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks successfully address FL communication bottlenecks while maintaining privacy and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Distributed learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), faces a significant bottleneck in the communication cost, particularly the uplink transmission of client-to-server updates, which is often constrained by asymmetric bandwidth limits at the edge. Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective TTS improves LLM agents' reasoning in multi-stage tasks by distributing compute and pruning low-quality branches early, outperforming traditional Test-Time Scaling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of traditional TTS in tasks with unverifiable rewards or insufficient data, leading to error accumulation in multi-stage pipelines.

Method: Introduces Selective TTS, distributing compute across stages and using process-specific judges to prune low-quality branches early.

Result: Improves insight quality (mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86) and reduces variance in a data science pipeline task.

Conclusion: Selective TTS is a promising approach for scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, like scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can increasingly automate complex reasoning through Test-Time Scaling (TTS), iterative refinement guided by reward signals. However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. We hope our findings serve as the first step toward to scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation.

*Achraf Hsain,Fouad Mohammed Abbou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantum generative models are applied to latent space representations of CFD data for the first time, showing superior performance over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of quantum generative models in modeling physics-derived latent distributions from CFD data, a previously unexplored area.

Method: A GPU-accelerated LBM simulator generates fluid vorticity fields, compressed into a 7D latent space via VQ-VAE. Quantum models (QCBM, QGAN) are compared to a classical LSTM baseline.

Result: Quantum models outperformed the LSTM baseline, with QCBM showing the best metrics in sample quality.

Conclusion: The study bridges CFD simulation and quantum ML, offering insights and a foundation for future research in quantum generative modeling for physics simulations.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of quantum generative models to learned latent space representations of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data. While recent work has explored quantum models for learning statistical properties of fluid systems, the combination of discrete latent space compression with quantum generative sampling for CFD remains unexplored. We develop a GPU-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulator to generate fluid vorticity fields, which are compressed into a discrete 7-dimensional latent space using a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The central contribution is a comparative analysis of quantum and classical generative approaches for modeling this physics-derived latent distribution: we evaluate a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) against a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) baseline. Under our experimental conditions, both quantum models produced samples with lower average minimum distances to the true distribution compared to the LSTM, with the QCBM achieving the most favorable metrics. This work provides: (1)~a complete open-source pipeline bridging CFD simulation and quantum machine learning, (2)~the first empirical study of quantum generative modeling on compressed latent representations of physics simulations, and (3)~a foundation for future rigorous investigation at this intersection.

*Donghwa Kang,Shana Moothedath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores decentralized multi-task representation learning with a low-rank structured feature matrix, proposing an efficient algorithm with reduced communication costs and outperforming centralized methods in some scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored area of decentralized representation learning, particularly in multi-task settings where data is distributed across nodes with constrained communication.

Method: The authors propose an alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm designed for decentralized multi-task representation learning, focusing on a low-rank feature matrix.

Result: The algorithm achieves provable accuracy guarantees with communication complexity independent of target accuracy, reducing costs. Numerical simulations confirm its effectiveness and superiority over centralized methods in certain cases.

Conclusion: The study concludes that decentralized learning, with the proposed algorithm, offers efficient communication and performance advantages over centralized federated approaches in specific regimes.

Abstract: Representation learning is a widely adopted framework for learning in data-scarce environments, aiming to extract common features from related tasks. While centralized approaches have been extensively studied, decentralized methods remain largely underexplored. We study decentralized multi-task representation learning in which the features share a low-rank structure. We consider multiple tasks, each with a finite number of data samples, where the observations follow a linear model with task-specific parameters. In the decentralized setting, task data are distributed across multiple nodes, and information exchange between nodes is constrained by a communication network. The goal is to recover the underlying feature matrix whose rank is much smaller than both the parameter dimension and the number of tasks. We propose a new alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm with provable accuracy guarantees. We provide comprehensive characterizations of the time, communication, and sample complexities. Importantly, the communication complexity is independent of the target accuracy, which significantly reduces communication cost compared to prior methods. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis across different dimensions and network topologies, and demonstrate regimes in which decentralized learning outperforms centralized federated approaches.

### [308] [Learning with the $p$-adics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22692)
*André F. T. Martins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using p-adic numbers (Q_p) instead of real numbers (R) in machine learning, highlighting their hierarchical structure and potential advantages in representation learning and code theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML frameworks rely on real numbers, but the paper questions if alternatives like p-adic numbers could offer unique benefits, such as hierarchical representations and simplified models like Quillian semantic networks.

Method: The paper provides theoretical foundations for classification, regression, and representation learning using p-adic numbers, including learning models and algorithms.

Result: The study shows that p-adic numbers enable compact representations like p-adic linear networks, which are unachievable with real numbers.

Conclusion: The framework opens new research directions for hierarchical learning and coding theory, with potential applications yet to be explored.

Abstract: Existing machine learning frameworks operate over the field of real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) and learn representations in real (Euclidean or Hilbert) vector spaces (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^d$). Their underlying geometric properties align well with intuitive concepts such as linear separability, minimum enclosing balls, and subspace projection; and basic calculus provides a toolbox for learning through gradient-based optimization.
  But is this the only possible choice? In this paper, we study the suitability of a radically different field as an alternative to $\mathbb{R}$ -- the ultrametric and non-archimedean space of $p$-adic numbers, $\mathbb{Q}_p$. The hierarchical structure of the $p$-adics and their interpretation as infinite strings make them an appealing tool for code theory and hierarchical representation learning. Our exploratory theoretical work establishes the building blocks for classification, regression, and representation learning with the $p$-adics, providing learning models and algorithms. We illustrate how simple Quillian semantic networks can be represented as a compact $p$-adic linear network, a construction which is not possible with the field of reals. We finish by discussing open problems and opportunities for future research enabled by this new framework.

### [309] [Predictive Modeling of Power Outages during Extreme Events: Integrating Weather and Socio-Economic Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22699)
*Antar Kumar Biswas,Masoud H. Nazari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework uses machine learning to predict power outages during extreme events, integrating diverse data sources and identifying LSTM as the most accurate model among RF, SVM, AdaBoost, and LSTM. Economic and infrastructure factors reduce outage risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address low-probability, high-consequence power outage scenarios by leveraging publicly available data to understand community vulnerability and outage risks during extreme events.

Method: The approach integrates EAGLE-I outage records (2014-2024) with weather, socio-economic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Four machine learning models (RF, SVM, AdaBoost, LSTM) are evaluated on Michigan county data.

Result: The LSTM model achieves the lowest prediction error. Findings also show stronger economic conditions and developed infrastructure correlate with fewer outages.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively predicts power outages, with LSTM outperforming other models. Socio-economic and infrastructure factors play a significant role in reducing outage risks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting power outages caused by extreme events. The proposed approach specifically targets low-probability, high-consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources. We integrate EAGLE-I outage records (2014-2024) with weather, socio-economic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals underlying patterns of community vulnerability and provides a clearer understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) are evaluated. Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves the lowest prediction error. Additionally, the results demonstrate that stronger economic conditions and more developed infrastructure are associated with lower outage occurrence.

*Valentina Moretti,Andrea Cini,Ivan Marisca,Cesare Alippi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TL;DR: The paper analyzes deep learning architectures for time series forecasting, emphasizing the importance of design principles like locality and globality over specific modeling layers. It critiques benchmarking practices and proposes a model card.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to clarify the impact of design choices in deep learning models for time series forecasting, given contradictory empirical results and the abundance of new architectures.

Method: The paper evaluates design dimensions and trade-offs in forecasting architectures, focusing on principles like locality and globality, and assesses overlooked implementation details.

Result: Simple, well-designed architectures can match state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of foundational aspects over specific layers.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for rethinking benchmarking practices and introduces an auxiliary forecasting model card to standardize architecture characterization.

Abstract: Deep learning models have grown increasingly popular in time series applications. However, the large quantity of newly proposed architectures, together with often contradictory empirical results, makes it difficult to assess which components contribute significantly to final performance. We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art. We discuss how overlooked implementation details in existing architectures (1) fundamentally change the class of the resulting forecasting method and (2) drastically affect the observed empirical results. Our results call for rethinking current faulty benchmarking practices and the need to focus on the foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures. As a step in this direction, we propose an auxiliary forecasting model card, whose fields serve to characterize existing and new forecasting architectures based on key design choices.

*Jiaqi Shao,Yufeng Miao,Wei Zhang,Bing Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FoldAct addresses scalability challenges in long-horizon RL for LLMs by tackling gradient dilution, self-conditioning, and computational costs via separated loss computation, full context consistency, and selective segment training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for context folding overlook the policy-dependent, non-stationary observation distribution, leading to inefficiencies and instability in training.

Method: FoldAct introduces separated loss computation for summary and action tokens, full context consistency loss, and selective segment training to stabilize training and reduce computational costs.

Result: FoldAct achieves stable training with a 5.19× speedup, addressing non-stationary observation issues.

Conclusion: FoldAct effectively resolves scalability challenges in long-horizon RL for LLMs through innovative loss computation and training techniques.

Abstract: Long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models faces critical scalability challenges from unbounded context growth, leading to context folding methods that compress interaction history during task execution. However, existing approaches treat summary actions as standard actions, overlooking that summaries fundamentally modify the agent's future observation space, creating a policy-dependent, non-stationary observation distribution that violates core RL assumptions. This introduces three fundamental challenges: (1) gradient dilution where summary tokens receive insufficient training signal, (2) self-conditioning where policy updates change summary distributions, creating a vicious cycle of training collapse, and (3) computational cost from processing unique contexts at each turn. We introduce \textbf{FoldAct}\footnote{https://github.com/SHAO-Jiaqi757/FoldAct}, a framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through three key innovations: separated loss computation for independent gradient signals on summary and action tokens, full context consistency loss to reduce distribution shift, and selective segment training to reduce computational cost. Our method enables stable training of long-horizon search agents with context folding, addressing the non-stationary observation problem while improving training efficiency with 5.19$\times$ speedup.

*Sungwoo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MTL improves classification but degrades regression performance due to data imbalance and property independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether multi-task learning (MTL) can leverage shared underlying physics for better predictions across related material properties.

Method: Simultaneously predicting electrical resistivity, Vickers hardness, and amorphous-forming ability using 54,028 alloy samples, comparing single-task models against standard and structured MTL.

Result: MTL significantly degrades regression performance (resistivity and hardness) but improves classification (amorphous-forming ability). Analysis shows near-zero inter-task weights, indicating property independence.

Conclusion: Recommend independent models for precise regression and MTL for classification tasks where recall is critical.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) assumes related material properties share underlying physics that can be leveraged for better predictions. We test this by simultaneously predicting electrical resistivity, Vickers hardness, and amorphous-forming ability using 54,028 alloy samples. We compare single-task models against standard and structured MTL. Results reveal a striking dichotomy: MTL significantly degrades regression performance (resistivity $R^2$: 0.897 $\to$ 0.844; hardness $R^2$: 0.832 $\to$ 0.694, $p < 0.01$) but improves classification (amorphous F1: 0.703 $\to$ 0.744, $p < 0.05$; recall +17%). Analysis shows near-zero inter-task weights, indicating property independence. Regression failure is attributed to negative transfer caused by severe data imbalance (52k vs. 800 samples). We recommend independent models for precise regression, while reserving MTL for classification tasks where recall is critical.

### [313] [Bridging Global Intent with Local Details: A Hierarchical Representation Approach for Semantic Validation in Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22744)
*Rihong Qiu,Zhibang Yang,Xinke Jiang,Weibin Liao,Xin Gao,Xu Chu,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HEROSQL introduces a hierarchical SQL representation integrating global intent and local details for semantic validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-SQL validation focuses on syntactic correctness, lacking effective semantic validation. Challenges include capturing user intent and SQL structural details, and generating high-quality sub-SQL annotations.

Method: HEROSQL uses Logical Plans (LPs) for global intent and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for local details, with a Nested Message Passing Neural Network (NMPNN) for relational information. It also employs an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods with a 9.40% AUPRC and 12.35% AUROC improvement in detecting semantic inconsistencies, excelling at fine-grained error detection.

Conclusion: HEROSQL enhances Text-to-SQL reliability and interpretability by addressing semantic validation challenges and improving feedback granularity.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translates natural language questions into SQL statements grounded in a target database schema. Ensuring the reliability and executability of such systems requires validating generated SQL, but most existing approaches focus only on syntactic correctness, with few addressing semantic validation (detecting misalignments between questions and SQL). As a consequence, effective semantic validation still faces two key challenges: capturing both global user intent and SQL structural details, and constructing high-quality fine-grained sub-SQL annotations. To tackle these, we introduce HEROSQL, a hierarchical SQL representation approach that integrates global intent (via Logical Plans, LPs) and local details (via Abstract Syntax Trees, ASTs). To enable better information propagation, we employ a Nested Message Passing Neural Network (NMPNN) to capture inherent relational information in SQL and aggregate schema-guided semantics across LPs and ASTs. Additionally, to generate high-quality negative samples, we propose an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy, supporting robust optimization of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. Extensive experiments conducted on Text-to-SQL validation benchmarks (both in-domain and out-of-domain settings) demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average 9.40% improvement of AUPRC and 12.35% of AUROC in identifying semantic inconsistencies. It excels at detecting fine-grained semantic errors, provides large language models with more granular feedback, and ultimately enhances the reliability and interpretability of data querying platforms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphLogDebugger, a dynamic graph-based framework for debugging tabular logs, outperforming LLMs with a simpler GNN approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for processing tabular logs rely too heavily on LLMs, lacking flexibility and scalability.

Method: The framework constructs dynamic graphs from tabular logs using heterogeneous nodes and edges, modeling system evolution.

Result: A simple dynamic GNN outperforms LLMs in debugging tabular logs, validated by experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GraphLogDebugger offers a scalable and flexible alternative to LLM-based approaches for log debugging.

Abstract: Tabular log abstracts objects and events in the real-world system and reports their updates to reflect the change of the system, where one can detect real-world inconsistencies efficiently by debugging corresponding log entries. However, recent advances in processing text-enriched tabular log data overly depend on large language models (LLMs) and other heavy-load models, thus suffering from limited flexibility and scalability. This paper proposes a new framework, GraphLogDebugger, to debug tabular log based on dynamic graphs. By constructing heterogeneous nodes for objects and events and connecting node-wise edges, the framework recovers the system behind the tabular log as an evolving dynamic graph. With the help of our dynamic graph modeling, a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network (GNN) is representative enough to outperform LLMs in debugging tabular log, which is validated by experimental results on real-world log datasets of computer systems and academic papers.

TL;DR: The paper studies third-party platform pricing with strategic agents, developing an algorithm with optimal regret and revealing supply-side noise's impact on demand learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of demand learning under confounding when only equilibrium prices and quantities are observable, aiming for revenue maximization.

Method: Develops an algorithm with optimal regret, uses non-i.i.d. actions as instrumental variables, and introduces a homeomorphic construction for demand learning with deep neural networks.

Result: Achieves optimal regret $	ilde{O}(\\sqrt{T}\\wedge\\sigma_S^{-2})$, showing supply-side noise affects demand learnability and enabling practical applications via simulations and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively learns demand under confounding, with theoretical guarantees and practical validation.

Abstract: We study the pricing behavior of third-party platforms facing strategic agents. Assuming the platform is a revenue maximizer, it observes market features that generally affect demand. Since only the equilibrium price and quantity are observable, this presents a general demand learning problem under confounding. Mathematically, we develop an algorithm with optimal regret of $\Tilde{\cO}(\sqrt{T}\wedgeσ_S^{-2})$. Our results reveal that supply-side noise fundamentally affects the learnability of demand, leading to a phase transition in regret. Technically, we show that non-i.i.d. actions can serve as instrumental variables for learning demand. We also propose a novel homeomorphic construction that allows us to establish estimation bounds without assuming star-shapedness, providing the first efficiency guarantee for learning demand with deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach through simulations and real-world data from Zomato and Lyft.

*Eswarasanthosh Kumar Mamillapalli,Nishtha Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A micro-macro ML framework integrates individual and environmental data to predict childhood obesity risk, highlighting geographic disparities and potential for public health applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of traditional epidemiological studies in analyzing interactions between individual and environmental factors influencing childhood obesity.

Method: Combines NHANES microdata (anthropometric, socioeconomic) with macro-level environmental features (food access, air quality, socioeconomic vulnerability) using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

Result: XGBoost performed best; geographic similarity found between high environmental burden states and predicted obesity risk.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates multi-scale data, offering scalable applications for public health informatics.

Abstract: Childhood obesity remains a major public health challenge in the United States, strongly influenced by a combination of individual-level, household-level, and environmental-level risk factors. Traditional epidemiological studies typically analyze these levels independently, limiting insights into how structural environmental conditions interact with individual-level characteristics to influence health outcomes. In this study, we introduce a micro-macro machine learning framework that integrates (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features, including food access, air quality, and socioeconomic vulnerability extracted from USDA and EPA datasets. Four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained to predict obesity using NHANES microdata. XGBoost achieved the strongest performance. A composite environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) was constructed using normalized indicators from USDA and EPA at the state level. Multi-level comparison revealed strong geographic similarity between states with high environmental burden and the nationally predicted micro-level obesity risk distribution. This demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multi-scale datasets to identify environment-driven disparities in obesity risk. This work contributes a scalable, data-driven, multi-level modeling pipeline suitable for public health informatics, demonstrating strong potential for expansion into causal modeling, intervention planning, and real-time analytics.

Motivation: To improve Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning by integrating Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning into a single framework.

Method: Analyzes a composite objective gradient (KL divergence + task rewards) decomposed into Dense Gradient (token-level imitation) and Sparse Gradient (reward optimization).

Result: Dense Gradient allows closed-form logit-level computation, enabling efficient GPU implementation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances imitation and reward optimization for scalable LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning that integrates Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning. By analyzing the gradient of a composite objective combining trajectory-level KL divergence with task rewards, we derive a natural decomposition into two components: (1) an analytically computable Dense Gradient for token-level imitation, and (2) a Monte Carlo estimated Sparse Gradient for long-horizon reward optimization. The Dense Gradient admits a closed-form logit-level formula, enabling efficient GPU implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for hyperparameter (HP) transfer across model scales, showing that fast transfer is asymptotically efficient. It explores conditions for successful transfer, highlighting empirical results with the Maximal Update Parameterization (μP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prohibitive cost of hyperparameter optimization for large deep learning models by enabling efficient HP transfer across scales.

Method: Develops a conceptual framework for HP transfer, analyzes conditions for fast transfer, and investigates empirical behavior using μP and synthetic settings.

Result: Fast HP transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. Empirical work shows μP facilitates transfer, but success depends on problem structure.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and empirical insights into HP transfer, identifying conditions for successful scaling and proposing a decomposition-based explanation for observed fast transfer.

Abstract: The growing scale of deep learning models has rendered standard hyperparameter (HP) optimization prohibitively expensive. A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($μ$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $μ$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum. We present empirical evidence for this hypothesis across various settings, including large language model pretraining.

*Xuyan Li,Jie Wang,Zheng Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRExplainer is a universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs), addressing limitations like lack of generality, high computational costs, and poor user-friendliness in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency and explainability in TGNNs hinders their practical adoption. Existing methods are limited by specificity, inefficiency, and complexity.

Method: GRExplainer uses node sequences as a unified feature representation, breadth-first search for efficiency, and a generative RNN model for automated explanations.

Result: Experiments on six datasets with three TGNNs show GRExplainer surpasses baselines in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

Conclusion: GRExplainer effectively addresses key issues in TGNN explainability, offering a versatile and practical solution.

Abstract: Dynamic graphs are widely used to represent evolving real-world networks. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends neural scaling laws to include granularity (G) as a scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D), demonstrating that familial models can achieve deployment flexibility without losing compute-optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing scaling laws that assume a single dense model output, ignoring the potential of familial models for heterogeneous deployments.

Method: Introduces a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and uses IsoFLOP experimental design to parameterize it, isolating architectural impact from computational scale.

Result: Finds that granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with a small exponent, validating the 'train once, deploy many' paradigm.

Conclusion: Familial models with granularity scaling offer deployment flexibility while maintaining compute-optimality, bridging theory and practice.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks "Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this "one-run, many-models" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the "train once, deploy many" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.

*Truong Son Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Schrödinger AI is a quantum-inspired ML framework with three components: wave-energy solver, dynamical solver, and low-rank operator calculus. It offers robust generalization and interpretable semantics, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a physics-driven alternative to conventional ML methods like cross-entropy training and transformer attention, focusing on robust generalization and interpretable semantics.

Method: The framework combines a time-independent wave-energy solver, a time-dependent dynamical solver, and a low-rank operator calculus to treat perception, classification, and symbolic transformations quantum-mechanically.

Result: Empirical results show emergent semantic manifolds, dynamic reasoning adaptability, and exact operator generalization in tasks like modular arithmetic.

Conclusion: Schrödinger AI suggests a new foundational direction for ML by learning and navigating semantic energy landscapes, offering interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Schrödinger AI}, a unified machine learning framework inspired by quantum mechanics. The system is defined by three tightly coupled components: (1) a {time-independent wave-energy solver} that treats perception and classification as spectral decomposition under a learned Hamiltonian; (2) a {time-dependent dynamical solver} governing the evolution of semantic wavefunctions over time, enabling context-aware decision revision, re-routing, and reasoning under environmental changes; and (3) a {low-rank operator calculus} that learns symbolic transformations such as modular arithmetic through learned quantum-like transition operators. Together, these components form a coherent physics-driven alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention, providing robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology.
  Empirically, Schrödinger AI demonstrates: (a) emergent semantic manifolds that reflect human-conceived class relations without explicit supervision; (b) dynamic reasoning that adapts to changing environments, including maze navigation with real-time potential-field perturbations; and (c) exact operator generalization on modular arithmetic tasks, where the system learns group actions and composes them across sequences far beyond training length. These results suggest a new foundational direction for machine learning, where learning is cast as discovering and navigating an underlying semantic energy landscape.

*Kasra Jalaldoust,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Circuit-TR, an algorithm for zero-shot compositional generalization using causal transportability theory, leveraging qualitative domain knowledge and limited target data for domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable generalization across domains by utilizing causal transportability theory and qualitative domain knowledge, addressing the challenge of zero-shot compositional generalization.

Method: Circuit-TR learns local predictors (modules) from source data and transports/composes them into circuits for target domain prediction, guided by causal structure and discrepancies oracle. It also adapts for supervised domain adaptation without explicit causal structure.

Result: Theoretical results identify classes of few-shot learnable tasks through graphical circuit transportability criteria, linking few-shot generalizability to circuit size complexity. Simulations validate these findings.

Conclusion: Circuit-TR effectively addresses zero-shot generalization and domain adaptation using causal transportability, with theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: Generalization across the domains is not possible without asserting a structure that constrains the unseen target domain w.r.t. the source domain. Building on causal transportability theory, we design an algorithm for zero-shot compositional generalization which relies on access to qualitative domain knowledge in form of a causal graph for intra-domain structure and discrepancies oracle for inter-domain mechanism sharing. \textit{Circuit-TR} learns a collection of modules (i.e., local predictors) from the source data, and transport/compose them to obtain a circuit for prediction in the target domain if the causal structure licenses. Furthermore, circuit transportability enables us to design a supervised domain adaptation scheme that operates without access to an explicit causal structure, and instead uses limited target data. Our theoretical results characterize classes of few-shot learnable tasks in terms of graphical circuit transportability criteria, and connects few-shot generalizability with the established notion of circuit size complexity; controlled simulations corroborate our theoretical results.

TL;DR: VL-RouterBench introduces a systematic benchmark for evaluating vision-language model routing systems, covering diverse datasets and models, and highlights gaps in current routing methods compared to an ideal Oracle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work lacks a systematic and reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in routing, necessitating a comprehensive framework like VL-RouterBench.

Method: The benchmark uses raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs to construct quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs, covering 14 datasets, 15 open-source models, and 2 API models.

Result: Evaluation shows significant routability gains with current methods, but a clear gap remains compared to the ideal Oracle, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: VL-RouterBench provides a reproducible toolchain for advancing multimodal routing research, with potential improvements suggested in router architecture.

Abstract: Multi-model routing has evolved from an engineering technique into essential infrastructure, yet existing work lacks a systematic, reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). We present VL-RouterBench to assess the overall capability of VLM routing systems systematically. The benchmark is grounded in raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs and constructs quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. In scale, VL-RouterBench covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups, totaling 30,540 samples, and includes 15 open-source models and 2 API models, yielding 519,180 sample-model pairs and a total input-output token volume of 34,494,977. The evaluation protocol jointly measures average accuracy, average cost, and throughput, and builds a ranking score from the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy to enable comparison across router configurations and cost budgets. On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure. We will open-source the complete data construction and evaluation toolchain to promote comparability, reproducibility, and practical deployment in multimodal routing research.

*Zhou Yang,Edward Dougherty,Chen Zhang,Zhenhe Pan,Fang Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes China's SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns using public tracking data, identifying regional differences, hospitalization timelines, and shifts in infection sources over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand effective public health interventions by studying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China.

Method: Collected case reports from health commissions and social media, applied NLP and manual curation to build transmission chains, and analyzed tracking and mobility data to visualize spread dynamics.

Result: Found regional differences in infections (more in larger cities), rapid hospitalization (79% within 5 days), and shifts in infection sources (from travel-linked to social activities).

Conclusion: Public health measures like testing and tracing are crucial, with social activities becoming a dominant transmission source later in the pandemic.

Abstract: A comprehensive retrospective analysis of public health interventions, such as large scale testing, quarantining, and contact tracing, can help identify mechanisms most effective in mitigating COVID-19. We investigate China based SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns (e.g., infection type and likely transmission source) using publicly released tracking data. We collect case reports from local health commissions, the Chinese CDC, and official local government social media, then apply NLP and manual curation to construct transmission/tracking chains. We further analyze tracking data together with Wuhan population mobility data to quantify and visualize temporal and spatial spread dynamics. Results indicate substantial regional differences, with larger cities showing more infections, likely driven by social activities. Most symptomatic individuals (79\%) were hospitalized within 5 days of symptom onset, and those with confirmed-case contact sought admission in under 5 days. Infection sources also shifted over time: early cases were largely linked to travel to (or contact with travelers from) Hubei Province, while later transmission was increasingly associated with social activities.

TL;DR: SNM-Net is a deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition that addresses feature distribution shifts and unknown interference by using geometric decoupling and Mahalanobis distance, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in open-set gas recognition, particularly feature distribution shifts and decision failures caused by unknown interference.

Method: Proposes SNM-Net with geometric decoupling (via cascaded normalization) and Mahalanobis distance scoring, compatible with various backbones like CNN, RNN, and Transformer.

Result: Achieves AUROC of 0.9977 and 99.57% unknown gas detection rate, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with significant robustness.

Conclusion: SNM-Net effectively balances accuracy and stability, offering a reliable solution for industrial E-nose deployment.

Abstract: Electronic nose (E-nose) systems face dual challenges in open-set gas recognition: feature distribution shifts caused by signal drift and decision failures induced by unknown interference. Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance, failing to adequately account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition. The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Additionally, Mahalanobis distance is introduced as the scoring mechanism, utilizing class-wise statistics to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries. SNM-Net is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with CNN, RNN, and Transformer backbones. Systematic experiments on the Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration attains near-theoretical performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR). This performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing a 3.0% improvement in AUROC and a 91.0% reduction in standard deviation compared to Class Anchor Clustering. The framework exhibits exceptional robustness across sensor positions with standard deviations below 0.0028. This work effectively resolves the trade-off between accuracy and stability, providing a solid technical foundation for industrial E-nose deployment.

TL;DR: The paper explores training AI models to generate better research plans by leveraging existing papers and reinforcement learning with self-grading, achieving significant improvements and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models struggle to generate research plans that follow constraints and implicit requirements, necessitating a method to improve their effectiveness as AI co-scientists.

Method: A scalable training corpus is built by extracting research goals and rubrics from papers. Models are trained via reinforcement learning with self-grading, using a frozen initial policy as a grader.

Result: Human experts preferred plans from the finetuned model (Qwen3-30B-A3B) for 70% of goals, and 84% of grading rubrics were approved. The approach also showed 12-22% improvements in other domains.

Conclusion: The automated training method proves effective for improving AI co-scientists, even in domains like medical research where execution feedback is challenging.

Abstract: AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based distillation framework for diffusion models, using dynamic reward signals to train students, achieving efficient performance with fewer steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slow sampling issue in diffusion models by enabling distillation with fewer steps or smaller models, leveraging teacher-student alignment dynamically.

Method: Treats distillation as a policy optimization problem, training students with rewards derived from teacher outputs, exploring multiple denoising paths dynamically.

Result: The framework achieves superior performance with fewer inference steps and computational resources, applicable to various diffusion models.

Conclusion: The RL-driven approach offers a general optimization paradigm for efficient diffusion learning, outperforming existing distillation techniques.

Abstract: Distillation addresses the slow sampling problem in diffusion models by creating models with smaller size or fewer steps that approximate the behavior of high-step teachers. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based distillation framework for diffusion models. Instead of relying on fixed reconstruction or consistency losses, we treat the distillation process as a policy optimization problem, where the student is trained using a reward signal derived from alignment with the teacher's outputs. This RL driven approach dynamically guides the student to explore multiple denoising paths, allowing it to take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions of the data distribution, rather than relying on incremental refinements. Our framework utilizes the inherent ability of diffusion models to handle larger steps and effectively manage the generative process. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques. Additionally, the framework is model agnostic, applicable to any type of diffusion models with suitable reward functions, providing a general optimization paradigm for efficient diffusion learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve mixed-precision training robustness by dynamically selecting tensor representations without compromising model quality.

Method: Per-tensor and sub-tensor level quantization framework (MoR) analyzing numerical properties to choose between FP8 and BF16 dynamically.

Result: Achieved 98.38% FP8 quantization with preserved model quality, showcasing potential for robust low-precision training.

Conclusion: MoR demonstrates effective dynamic quantization, enabling FP8 accuracy without fine-grain partitioning and potential for lower precision formats like NVFP4.

Abstract: Mixed-precision training is a crucial technique for scaling deep learning models, but successful mixedprecision training requires identifying and applying the right combination of training methods. This paper presents our preliminary study on Mixture-of-Representations (MoR), a novel, per-tensor and sub-tensor level quantization framework that dynamically analyzes a tensor's numerical properties to select between a variety of different representations. Based on the framework, we have proposed and experimented concrete algorithms that choose dynamically between FP8 and BF16 representations for both per-tensor and sub-tensor level granularities. Our universal approach is designed to preserve model quality across various quantization partition strategies and datasets. Our initial findings show that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art results with 98.38% of tensors quantized to the FP8 format. This work highlights the potential of dynamic, property-aware quantization while preserving model quality. We believe this approach can generally improve the robustness of low precision training, as demonstrated by achieving FP8 accuracies that are on par with existing approaches without the need for fine-grain partitioning, or can be used in combination with other training methods to improve the leverage of even lower precision number formats such as NVFP4.

*Scott A. Martin,Noah Brenowitz,Dale Durran,Michael Pritchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Long-range distillation trains probabilistic models using synthetic data from autoregressive 'teacher' models to improve long-range weather forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for weather forecasting accumulate errors over time and require large datasets to capture slow climate variability, prompting the need for alternative methods.

Method: A 'student' model is trained with synthetic data generated by a short-timestep autoregressive 'teacher' model (DLESyM), producing over 10,000 years of simulated climate data.

Result: Distilled models outperform climatology, match teacher model skill, and achieve subseasonal-to-seasonal forecast skill comparable to ECMWF after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: AI-generated synthetic data can effectively scale long-range forecast skill, demonstrating potential for improved weather prediction.

Abstract: Accurate long-range weather forecasting remains a major challenge for AI models, both because errors accumulate over autoregressive rollouts and because reanalysis datasets used for training offer a limited sample of the slow modes of climate variability underpinning predictability. Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic "student" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive "teacher" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep. In the real world, they achieve S2S forecast skill comparable to the ECMWF ensemble forecast after ERA5 fine-tuning. The skill of our distilled models scales with increasing synthetic training data, even when that data is orders of magnitude larger than ERA5. This represents the first demonstration that AI-generated synthetic training data can be used to scale long-range forecast skill.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to improve Goal-Conditioned RL by dynamically prioritizing high-uncertainty goals, leading to efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods struggle with sample inefficiency in multi-goal tasks, prompting the need for adaptive, structured learning inspired by biological systems.

Method: Proposes a teacher module that prioritizes goals based on temporal variance in policy confidence (Q-values), providing adaptive learning signals.

Result: Evaluated on 11 robotic and maze tasks, the method outperforms state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection approaches.

Conclusion: The framework accelerates Goal-Conditioned RL efficiently and is compatible with existing RL methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved significant success in solving single-goal tasks. However, uniform goal selection often results in sample inefficiency in multi-goal settings where agents must learn a universal goal-conditioned policy. Inspired by the adaptive and structured learning processes observed in biological systems, we propose a novel Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to accelerate Goal-Conditioned RL. In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress. We establish a theoretical connection between the temporal variance of Q-values and the evolution of the policy, providing insights into the method's underlying principles. Our approach is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing RL frameworks. We demonstrate this through evaluation across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks. The results show consistent and notable improvements over state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection methods.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes target loss estimation error relative to surrogate loss estimation error in machine learning, introducing H-consistency bounds as stronger guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address discrepancies between optimized surrogate losses and target task performance losses, providing stronger guarantees than existing methods.

Method: Analyzing H-consistency bounds for binary and multi-class classification, covering convex surrogates, adversarial settings, and comp-sum losses.

Result: Established tight bounds for various surrogates, introduced smooth adversarial variants, and demonstrated universal growth rates.

Conclusion: The framework offers robust guarantees and insights for surrogate selection, enhancing understanding of loss function discrepancies.

Abstract: In machine learning, the loss functions optimized during training often differ from the target loss that defines task performance due to computational intractability or lack of differentiability. We present an in-depth study of the target loss estimation error relative to the surrogate loss estimation error. Our analysis leads to $H$-consistency bounds, which are guarantees accounting for the hypothesis set $H$. These bounds offer stronger guarantees than Bayes-consistency or $H$-calibration and are more informative than excess error bounds.
  We begin with binary classification, establishing tight distribution-dependent and -independent bounds. We provide explicit bounds for convex surrogates (including linear models and neural networks) and analyze the adversarial setting for surrogates like $ρ$-margin and sigmoid loss. Extending to multi-class classification, we present the first $H$-consistency bounds for max, sum, and constrained losses, covering both non-adversarial and adversarial scenarios. We demonstrate that in some cases, non-trivial $H$-consistency bounds are unattainable. We also investigate comp-sum losses (e.g., cross-entropy, MAE), deriving their first $H$-consistency bounds and introducing smooth adversarial variants that yield robust learning algorithms.
  We develop a comprehensive framework for deriving these bounds across various surrogates, introducing new characterizations for constrained and comp-sum losses. Finally, we examine the growth rates of $H$-consistency bounds, establishing a universal square-root growth rate for smooth surrogates in binary and multi-class tasks, and analyze minimizability gaps to guide surrogate selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reliability and efficiency of LLMs by leveraging multiple experts—deferring uncertain inputs to experts and routing simpler queries to distilled models.

Method: Introduces surrogate losses for abstention and deferral in classification and regression, with single-stage and two-stage settings, backed by non-asymptotic consistency proofs.

Result: Superior performance on datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, with effective algorithms for both abstention and deferral scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework advances learning with deferral and abstention, offering strong theoretical guarantees and practical benefits for LLMs and beyond.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but face critical challenges: hallucinations and high inference costs. Leveraging multiple experts offers a solution: deferring uncertain inputs to more capable experts improves reliability, while routing simpler queries to smaller, distilled models enhances efficiency. This motivates the problem of learning with multiple-expert deferral. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of this problem and the related problem of learning with abstention, supported by strong consistency guarantees.
  First, for learning with abstention (a special case of deferral), we analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations in multi-class classification. We introduce new families of surrogate losses and prove strong non-asymptotic, hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, resolving two existing open questions. We analyze both single-stage and practical two-stage settings, with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithms.
  Second, we address general multi-expert deferral in classification. We design new surrogate losses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios and prove they benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. For the two-stage scenario, we show that our surrogate losses are realizable $H$-consistent for constant cost functions, leading to effective new algorithms.
  Finally, we introduce a novel framework for regression with deferral to address continuous label spaces. Our versatile framework accommodates multiple experts and various cost structures, supporting both single-stage and two-stage methods. It subsumes recent work on regression with abstention. We propose new surrogate losses with proven $H$-consistency and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the resulting algorithms.

*S. Dai,G. Sun,F. Li,X. Tang,Q. Wang,Y. Cong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Federated Multi-Task Clustering (FMTC), a framework addressing the limitations of existing centralized and federated clustering methods by leveraging personalized models and shared knowledge in a privacy-preserving manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering models are centralized and struggle in decentralized environments. Federated learning approaches suffer from poor generalization due to unreliable pseudo-labels and fail to capture client correlations.

Method: FMTC combines client-side personalized clustering (avoiding pseudo-labels) with server-side tensorial correlation (capturing shared knowledge via low-rank tensor regularization). Optimization uses ADMM for privacy-preserving distributed learning.

Result: Experiments show FMTC outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: FMTC effectively addresses heterogeneity and privacy concerns in federated clustering, demonstrating superior performance through personalized and collaborative learning.

Abstract: Spectral clustering has emerged as one of the most effective clustering algorithms due to its superior performance. However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cognitive diagnosis assesses student skill mastery, but existing methods struggle with long-tailed data and dynamic changes.

Method: Uses meta-learning for optimal initialization and a parameter protection mechanism for continual learning.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalization on five real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MetaCD effectively tackles long-tailed data and dynamic changes, enhancing model stability and generalization.

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis is an essential research topic in intelligent education, aimed at assessing the level of mastery of different skills by students. So far, many research works have used deep learning models to explore the complex interactions between students, questions, and skills. However, the performance of existing method is frequently limited by the long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework for cognitive diagnosis based on continual learning (MetaCD). This framework can alleviate the long-tailed problem by utilizing meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization state, enabling the model to achieve good accuracy on new tasks with only a small amount of data. In addition, we utilize a continual learning method named parameter protection mechanism to give MetaCD the ability to adapt to new skills or new tasks, in order to adapt to dynamic changes in data. MetaCD can not only improve the plasticity of our model on a single task, but also ensure the stability and generalization of the model on sequential tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that MetaCD outperforms other baselines in both accuracy and generalization.

*Ünver Çiftçi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sat-EnQ introduces a two-phase framework to stabilize deep Q-learning, first training lightweight Q-networks under a satisficing objective to limit early instability, then distilling into a larger network for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Q-learning is unstable early in training due to maximization amplifying errors. Sat-EnQ aims to make learning robust by adopting a 'good enough' approach before aggressive optimization.

Method: Phase 1 trains lightweight Q-networks with a satisficing objective to limit value growth and avoid overestimation. Phase 2 distills the ensemble into a larger network and fine-tunes with Double DQN.

Result: Sat-EnQ reduces variance by 3.8x, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs 50% for DQN), maintains 79% performance under noise, and uses 2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles.

Conclusion: Sat-EnQ provides a principled path to robust reinforcement learning by prioritizing satisficing before optimization, significantly improving stability and efficiency.

Abstract: Deep Q-learning algorithms remain notoriously unstable, especially during early training when the maximization operator amplifies estimation errors. Inspired by bounded rationality theory and developmental learning, we introduce Sat-EnQ, a two-phase framework that first learns to be ``good enough'' before optimizing aggressively. In Phase 1, we train an ensemble of lightweight Q-networks under a satisficing objective that limits early value growth using a dynamic baseline, producing diverse, low-variance estimates while avoiding catastrophic overestimation. In Phase 2, the ensemble is distilled into a larger network and fine-tuned with standard Double DQN. We prove theoretically that satisficing induces bounded updates and cannot increase target variance, with a corollary quantifying conditions for substantial reduction. Empirically, Sat-EnQ achieves 3.8x variance reduction, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs 50% for DQN), maintains 79% performance under environmental noise}, and requires 2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles. Our results highlight a principled path toward robust reinforcement learning by embracing satisficing before optimization.

*Vincent Herrmann,Eric Alcaide,Michael Wand,Jürgen Schmidhuber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MTD measures computational effort in LMs via KL divergence between full and auxiliary outputs, offering a lightweight, stable solution for analyzing and steering model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for computational effort in language models are invasive or unstable, necessitating a simpler, more reliable measure.

Method: Proposes Multiple Token Divergence (MTD), a KL divergence-based metric between full and auxiliary prediction heads, requiring no additional training. Introduces Divergence Steering for computational control.

Result: MTD outperforms prior methods in distinguishing task complexity, correlates with problem difficulty in math tasks, and associates lower MTD with higher reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: MTD is a practical tool for analyzing and controlling computational effort in language models.

Abstract: Measuring the in-context computational effort of language models is a key challenge, as metrics like next-token loss fail to capture reasoning complexity. Prior methods based on latent state compressibility can be invasive and unstable. We propose Multiple Token Divergence (MTD), a simple measure of computational effort defined as the KL divergence between a model's full output distribution and that of a shallow, auxiliary prediction head. MTD can be computed directly from pre-trained models with multiple prediction heads, requiring no additional training. Building on this, we introduce Divergence Steering, a novel decoding method to control the computational character of generated text. We empirically show that MTD is more effective than prior methods at distinguishing complex tasks from simple ones. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, MTD correlates positively with problem difficulty. Lower MTD is associated with more accurate reasoning. MTD provides a practical, lightweight tool for analyzing and steering the computational dynamics of language models.

### [337] [APO: Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22953)
*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APO introduces an anchored framework using Csiszar alpha-divergence to balance forward and reverse KL divergence, improving stability and performance in alignment practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods either under-exploit high-reward modes or risk mode collapse. APO aims to bridge this gap by interpolating between forward and reverse KL divergence.

Method: APO uses Csiszar alpha-divergence within anchored geometry to unify gradient dynamics. It includes a reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule for transitioning from coverage to exploitation.

Result: Experiments show APO achieves competitive performance with GRPO and GSPO baselines while maintaining stability.

Conclusion: APO provides a flexible and stable approach to alignment by balancing mode-covering and mode-seeking behaviors.

Abstract: Two divergence regimes dominate modern alignment practice. Supervised fine-tuning and many distillation-style objectives implicitly minimize the forward KL divergence KL(q || pi_theta), yielding stable mode-covering updates but often under-exploiting high-reward modes. In contrast, PPO-style online reinforcement learning from human feedback behaves closer to reverse KL divergence KL(pi_theta || q), enabling mode-seeking improvements but risking mode collapse. Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence. We introduce Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization (APO), an anchored framework that uses Csiszar alpha-divergence to continuously interpolate between forward and reverse KL behavior within the same anchored geometry. We derive unified gradient dynamics parameterized by alpha, analyze gradient variance properties, and propose a practical reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule that transitions from coverage to exploitation only when the policy is both improving and confidently calibrated. Experiments on Qwen3-1.7B with math-level3 demonstrate that APO achieves competitive performance with GRPO and GSPO baselines while maintaining training stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited access to real-world longitudinal data due to privacy and logistical constraints hinders research reproducibility and benchmarking in stress modeling and behavioral analysis.

Method: FLOW is generated via a rule-based, feedback-driven simulation, creating coherent temporal dynamics across variables like stress, sleep, and mood for 1,000 individuals over two years.

Result: The dataset and configurable data generation tool provide a publicly available resource for exploratory analysis and methodological benchmarking.

Conclusion: FLOW serves as a controlled experimental environment for research and development where real-world data is unavailable.

Abstract: Access to longitudinal, individual-level data on work-life balance and wellbeing is limited by privacy, ethical, and logistical constraints. This poses challenges for reproducible research, methodological benchmarking, and education in domains such as stress modeling, behavioral analysis, and machine learning.
  We introduce FLOW, a synthetic longitudinal dataset designed to model daily interactions between workload, lifestyle behaviors, and wellbeing. FLOW is generated using a rule-based, feedback-driven simulation that produces coherent temporal dynamics across variables such as stress, sleep, mood, physical activity, and body weight. The dataset simulates 1{,}000 individuals over a two-year period with daily resolution and is released as a publicly available resource.
  In addition to the static dataset, we describe a configurable data generation tool that enables reproducible experimentation under adjustable behavioral and contextual assumptions. FLOW is intended as a controlled experimental environment rather than a proxy for observed human populations, supporting exploratory analysis, methodological development, and benchmarking where real-world data are inaccessible.

*Amirali Vakili,Salar Jahanshiri,Armin Salimi-Badr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging is proposed, addressing class imbalance and limited receptive-field modeling, achieving improved accuracy and N1 stage detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sleep disorders are globally prevalent, and automatic sleep staging using single-channel EEG signals is crucial but faces challenges like class imbalance and lack of interpretability.

Method: Combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling, applies class-weighted loss functions and data augmentation, and uses sub-epoch chunking for final predictions.

Result: Achieves 89.72% accuracy, 85.46% macro-average F1-score, and notably 61.7% F1-score for the N1 stage on SleepEDF datasets.

Conclusion: The framework improves sleep staging performance while ensuring interpretability and clinical applicability.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging is a critical task in healthcare due to the global prevalence of sleep disorders. This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively improves sleep staging performance while maintaining interpretability and suitability for real-world clinical applications.

*Tillmann Rheude,Roland Eils,Benjamin Wild*

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that complex multimodal learning methods improve performance, proposing a simpler baseline (SimBaMM) and showing it often matches or outperforms complex methods under standardized conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically test whether complex multimodal-specific architectures reliably outperform simpler methods, addressing gaps in methodological rigor in the field.

Method: Reimplementation of 19 high-impact methods under standardized conditions, evaluation across nine diverse datasets, and introduction of SimBaMM, a late-fusion Transformer.

Result: Complex methods do not reliably outperform SimBaMM or well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in small-data regimes.

Conclusion: Advocates shifting focus from architectural novelty to methodological rigor, supported by empirical findings and a reliability checklist.

Abstract: Deep learning architectures for multimodal learning have increased in complexity, driven by the assumption that multimodal-specific methods improve performance. We challenge this assumption through a large-scale empirical study reimplementing 19 high-impact methods under standardized conditions, evaluating them across nine diverse datasets with up to 23 modalities, and testing their generalizability to new tasks beyond their original scope, including settings with missing modalities. We propose a Simple Baseline for Multimodal Learning (SimBaMM), a straightforward late-fusion Transformer architecture, and demonstrate that under standardized experimental conditions with rigorous hyperparameter tuning of all methods, more complex architectures do not reliably outperform SimBaMM. Statistical analysis indicates that more complex methods perform comparably to SimBaMM and frequently do not reliably outperform well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in the small-data regime considered in many original studies. To support our findings, we include a case study of a recent multimodal learning method highlighting the methodological shortcomings in the literature. In addition, we provide a pragmatic reliability checklist to promote comparable, robust, and trustworthy future evaluations. In summary, we argue for a shift in focus: away from the pursuit of architectural novelty and toward methodological rigor.

### [341] [Merge before Forget: A Single LoRA Continual Learning via Continual Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23017)
*Fuli Qiao,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel continual learning method for LLMs that uses orthogonal initialization and sequential merging of LoRA updates to address computational memory growth and task interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA-based continual learning methods face issues like growing memory usage, limited storage, and task interference due to ineffective LoRA merging.

Method: The proposed method initializes LoRAs orthogonally and merges them sequentially into a unified LoRA, leveraging orthogonal basis extraction and time-aware scaling.

Result: The approach maintains constant memory complexity, minimizes task interference, and outperforms asymmetric LoRA merging.

Conclusion: The method is effective and efficient, validated by theoretical analysis and experiments across benchmarks.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient continual learning has emerged as a promising approach for large language models (LLMs) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRAs learn new tasks. However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling. We provide theoretical analysis to justify our design and conduct extensive experiments across diverse continual learning benchmarks using various Llama models, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

*Muhammad Haseeb,Salaar Masood,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses Mechanistic Interpretability to study why FedAvg performs poorly with Non-IID data, finding that conflicting updates cause destructive interference in functional sub-networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to uncover the underlying mechanistic reasons for performance degradation in Federated Learning under Non-IID conditions.

Method: The authors train interpretable, sparse neural networks within FL, track circuits across clients, and use Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to measure circuit preservation.

Result: Non-IID data causes structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, degrading the global model.

Conclusion: The findings reframe statistical drift as a mechanistic failure, suggesting more targeted solutions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of models on decentralized data, but its performance degrades significantly under Non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data conditions. While this accuracy loss is well-documented, the internal mechanistic causes remain a black box. This paper investigates the canonical FedAvg algorithm through the lens of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) to diagnose this failure mode. We hypothesize that the aggregation of conflicting client updates leads to circuit collapse, the destructive interference of functional, sparse sub-networks responsible for specific class predictions. By training inherently interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks within an FL framework, we identify and track these circuits across clients and communication rounds. Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data distributions cause structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to their degradation in the global model. Our findings reframe the problem of statistical drift in FL as a concrete, observable failure of mechanistic preservation, paving the way for more targeted solutions.

*Min Zhu,Jingmin Sun,Zecheng Zhang,Hayden Schaeffer,Lu Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PI-MFM is a physics-informed multimodal foundation model for solving PDEs efficiently, outperforming data-driven methods by enforcing physics constraints during training and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PDE solution operators are data-hungry and ignore physics constraints. PI-MFM addresses this by integrating physics directly into training.

Method: PI-MFM uses symbolic PDE inputs, auto-generates residual losses via vectorized derivatives, and enables unified physics-informed training across PDE families.

Result: PI-MFM outperforms data-driven methods on 13 PDE families, especially with sparse data, noisy inputs, or partial observations. It also shows strong zero-shot adaptation to unseen PDEs.

Conclusion: PI-MFM offers a scalable, data-efficient approach for transferable PDE solvers by combining physics-informed training with multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical systems, and recent multimodal foundation models have shown promise for learning PDE solution operators across diverse equation families. However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch. These results show that PI-MFM provides a practical and scalable path toward data-efficient, transferable PDE solvers.

*Boyang Zhang,Xiaobing Chen,Songyang Zhang,Shuai Zhang,Xiangwei Zhou,Mingxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLEX-MoE is a federated MoE framework addressing expert assignment and load balancing challenges in FL with non-IID data and resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in deploying MoE models with FL include resource limits on edge devices and expert load imbalance due to non-IID data.

Method: FLEX-MoE uses client-expert fitness scores and an optimization algorithm to balance expert utilization and specialization.

Result: Experiments show FLEX-MoE's superior performance and balanced expert utilization across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: FLEX-MoE effectively addresses expert utilization skew and enhances MoE model performance in FL settings.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable neural networks through conditional computation. However, their deployment with federated learning (FL) faces two critical challenges: 1) resource-constrained edge devices cannot store full expert sets, and 2) non-IID data distributions cause severe expert load imbalance that degrades model performance. To this end, we propose \textbf{FLEX-MoE}, a novel federated MoE framework that jointly optimizes expert assignment and load balancing under limited client capacity. Specifically, our approach introduces client-expert fitness scores that quantify the expert suitability for local datasets through training feedback, and employs an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide. Unlike existing greedy methods that focus solely on personalization while ignoring load imbalance, our FLEX-MoE is capable of addressing the expert utilization skew, which is particularly severe in FL settings with heterogeneous data. Our comprehensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FLEX-MoE, together with its ability to maintain balanced expert utilization across diverse resource-constrained scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MFT-VLM applies Mask Fine-Tuning to VLMs, outperforming LoRA and full fine-tuning by reusing pre-trained knowledge through gating scores instead of weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for VLMs rely on weight updates, ignoring the potential of reusing pre-trained structures. MFT offers a more efficient alternative.

Method: Apply Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) to language and projector components of VLMs, using learnable gating scores to adapt internal subnetworks without weight updates.

Result: MFT consistently outperforms LoRA variants and full fine-tuning while keeping the backbone frozen, demonstrating effective adaptation through structural reparameterization.

Conclusion: MFT reveals that VLMs can achieve high performance by reconnecting existing knowledge, offering a promising direction for efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Explorations in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), have made impressive progress. However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

*Yingru Li,Jiacai Liu,Jiawei Xu,Yuxuan Tong,Ziniu Li,Baoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the approximation error in policy gradient methods for large language models due to off-policy mismatch, deriving tighter bounds and proposing Trust Region Masking (TRM) to ensure non-vacuous guarantees for long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the unavoidable approximation error in modern LLM-RL due to factors like implementation divergence and distributed training staleness, rendering classical trust region bounds ineffective for long sequences.

Method: The authors derive two tighter bounds (Pinsker-Marginal and Mixed) and introduce Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes sequences violating trust regions from gradient computation.

Result: The derived bounds scale more favorably with sequence length (O(T^{3/2}) and O(T)), focusing on maximum token-level KL divergence, and TRM ensures non-vacuous improvement guarantees.

Conclusion: TRM provides a practical solution for controlling approximation error in long-horizon tasks, offering the first non-vacuous guarantees for such scenarios in LLM-RL.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods for large language models optimize a surrogate objective computed from samples of a rollout policy $π_{\text{roll}}$. When $π_{\text{roll}} \ne π_θ$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.

*Deyang Zheng,Tianyi Zhang,Wenming Zheng,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MFMC is a self-supervised learning framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence for affective computing, outperforming existing methods on emotional state recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotional states involve complex, coordinated physiological responses across multiple modalities, but existing SSL methods fail to capture higher-order interactions due to reliance on pairwise alignment.

Method: Proposes MFMC, which uses Dual Total Correlation (DTC) and Functional Maximum Correlation Analysis (FMCA) to directly model joint multimodal interactions without pairwise contrastive losses.

Result: MFMC achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on three benchmarks, improving accuracy on CEAP-360VR and maintaining robustness on MAHNOB-HCI EEG splits.

Conclusion: MFMC effectively captures higher-order multimodal dependencies in affective computing, demonstrating superior performance and robustness across diverse evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Emotional states manifest as coordinated yet heterogeneous physiological responses across central and autonomic systems, posing a fundamental challenge for multimodal representation learning in affective computing. Learning such joint dynamics is further complicated by the scarcity and subjectivity of affective annotations, which motivates the use of self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most existing SSL approaches rely on pairwise alignment objectives, which are insufficient to characterize dependencies among more than two modalities and fail to capture higher-order interactions arising from coordinated brain and autonomic responses.
  To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective. By deriving a tight sandwich bound and optimizing it using a functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) based trace surrogate, MFMC captures joint multimodal interactions directly, without relying on pairwise contrastive losses.
  Experiments on three public affective computing benchmarks demonstrate that MFMC consistently achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation protocols, highlighting its robustness to inter-subject variability. In particular, MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%, and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1% using the EDA signal alone. Moreover, MFMC remains within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses training-inference mismatch in RL for LLMs, showing its asymmetric impact and proposing dynamic vocabulary pruning to stabilize training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mismatch between high-throughput inference and precise training in LLMs causes destabilizing biases, particularly for low-probability tokens.

Method: Proposes dynamically pruning the RL objective's vocabulary to exclude extreme low-probability tokens, replacing biased mismatches with bounded optimization bias.

Result: Empirically stabilizes training; theoretically bounds the introduced optimization bias.

Conclusion: Dynamic vocabulary pruning effectively mitigates training-inference mismatch by focusing on a 'safe' vocabulary, ensuring stable RL training for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs) faces a fundamental tension: high-throughput inference engines and numerically-precise training systems produce different probability distributions from the same parameters, creating a training-inference mismatch. We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.

*Paul M. Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates when generative and vision-language models (VLMs) can achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated predictions in biomedicine. It focuses on structural assumptions like smooth dependence on low-dimensional semantic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations in biomedicine, avoiding large errors in rare conditions despite low overall loss.

Method: Analyzes VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with prompt embeddings, using classical uniform convergence tools.

Result: Derives finite-sample bounds showing sample complexity depends on intrinsic dimension and eigenvalue decay, not ambient dimension.

Conclusion: Highlights implications for biomedical modeling, emphasizing when current datasets support reliable predictions and pitfalls of average calibration metrics.

Abstract: Modern generative and vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in scientific and medical decision support, where predicted probabilities must be both accurate and well calibrated. Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low.
  We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.
  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements. We conclude with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, including when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may miss worst-case miscalibration.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SE-MLP, a multi-layer perceptron with channel attention and residual connections, for rapid prediction of penetration acceleration features, outperforming other models in accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost and time of obtaining penetration acceleration features through simulations, a faster and more efficient prediction method is needed.

Method: The SE-MLP integrates a channel attention mechanism and residual connections to map physical parameters to acceleration features, validated against MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models.

Result: SE-MLP shows superior accuracy, generalization, and stability, with predicted values within engineering tolerances in simulations and tests.

Conclusion: The method is feasible and practical for generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes efficiently.

Abstract: Accurate identification of the penetration process relies heavily on prior feature values of penetration acceleration. However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances. These results validate the feasibility and engineering applicability of the proposed method and provide a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces METRO, a principled algorithm for optimizing generalized metrics like $F_β$-measure and AM measure in imbalanced classification, with proven theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard binary classification metrics are inadequate for imbalanced or cost-sensitive scenarios. Existing methods lack tailored solutions and finite-sample guarantees.

Method: Reformulates metric optimization as cost-sensitive learning, designing surrogate loss functions with $H$-consistency. Introduces METRO with strong theoretical guarantees.

Result: Experiments show METRO outperforms prior baselines in optimizing generalized metrics.

Conclusion: METRO offers a theoretically grounded and effective solution for metric optimization in imbalanced classification tasks.

Abstract: In applications with significant class imbalance or asymmetric costs, metrics such as the $F_β$-measure, AM measure, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and weighted accuracy offer more suitable evaluation criteria than standard binary classification loss. However, optimizing these metrics present significant computational and statistical challenges. Existing approaches often rely on the characterization of the Bayes-optimal classifier, and use threshold-based methods that first estimate class probabilities and then seek an optimal threshold. This leads to algorithms that are not tailored to restricted hypothesis sets and lack finite-sample performance guarantees. In this work, we introduce principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics, supported by $H$-consistency and finite-sample generalization bounds. Our approach reformulates metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive learning problem, enabling the design of novel surrogate loss functions with provable $H$-consistency guarantees. Leveraging this framework, we develop new algorithms, METRO (Metric Optimization), with strong theoretical performance guarantees. We report the results of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods compared to prior baselines.

TL;DR: GNN-TF model integrates non-Euclidean brain imaging and Euclidean tabular data for superior longitudinal outcome prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in forecasting outcomes from longitudinal imaging studies due to the difficulty of integrating Euclidean and non-Euclidean data.

Method: Time-aware graph neural network with transformer fusion (GNN-TF) integrates tabular and dynamic brain connectivity data.

Result: GNN-TF outperforms existing models in predicting future tobacco usage using longitudinal fMRI data.

Conclusion: GNN-TF is a valuable tool for clinical outcome prediction by leveraging temporal dynamics and multiple data modalities.

Abstract: Integrating non-Euclidean brain imaging data with Euclidean tabular data, such as clinical and demographic information, poses a substantial challenge for medical imaging analysis, particularly in forecasting future outcomes. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.

*Xianqi Liu,Xiangru Li,Lefeng He,Ziyu Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a specialized dataset for weak signal learning (WSL) and proposes a dual-view representation model (PDVFN) to address challenges like low SNR and class imbalance, showing improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weak signal learning is hindered by noise, interference, and lack of dedicated datasets, limiting feature identification and model performance in fields like fault diagnosis and medical imaging.

Method: The authors construct a dataset with low SNR and extreme class imbalance, propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map), and develop PDVFN, a model focusing on local enhancement, noise suppression, and multi-scale capture.

Result: PDVFN outperforms in handling weak signals, high noise, and class imbalance, achieving higher accuracy, especially in low SNR scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides a dedicated WSL dataset, a baseline model (PDVFN), and lays groundwork for future research in weak signal learning.

Abstract: Weak signal learning (WSL) is a common challenge in many fields like fault diagnosis, medical imaging, and autonomous driving, where critical information is often masked by noise and interference, making feature identification difficult. Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios. This study provides a dedicated dataset, a baseline model, and establishes a foundation for future WSL research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of decentralized approaches in representation learning, especially for multi-task linear regression scenarios.

Method: Develops an alternating projected gradient descent and minimization algorithm in a decentralized and federated fashion.

Result: Provides theoretical guarantees on sample and iteration complexity, and demonstrates fast, communication-efficient performance in simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively addresses decentralized multi-task representation learning with validated performance.

Abstract: Representation learning is a widely adopted framework for learning in data-scarce environments to obtain a feature extractor or representation from various different yet related tasks. Despite extensive research on representation learning, decentralized approaches remain relatively underexplored. This work develops a decentralized projected gradient descent-based algorithm for multi-task representation learning. We focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. We present an alternating projected gradient descent and minimization algorithm for recovering a low-rank feature matrix in a diffusion-based decentralized and federated fashion. We obtain constructive, provable guarantees that provide a lower bound on the required sample complexity and an upper bound on the iteration complexity of our proposed algorithm. We analyze the time and communication complexity of our algorithm and show that it is fast and communication-efficient. We performed numerical simulations to validate the performance of our algorithm and compared it with benchmark algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive evaluation of 12 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods under RLVR reveals that structural variants outperform LoRA, while SVD-informed initialization fails due to spectral collapse. Extreme parameter reduction also harms reasoning capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to identify the optimal PEFT architecture for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), as current defaults like LoRA lack thorough evaluation in this context.

Method: The authors evaluate over 12 PEFT methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill families, including structural variants (DoRA, AdaLoRA, MiSS) and SVD-informed strategies (PiSSA, MiLoRA). Ablation studies and scaling experiments further validate results.

Result: Structural PEFT variants consistently outperform LoRA, while SVD-informed methods suffer from spectral collapse. Extreme parameter reduction (&#39;&e.g., VeRA, Rank-1) significantly limits reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The findings advocate for deeper exploration of parameter-efficient RL methods, challenging the default use of LoRA and highlighting the pitfalls of SVD-informed strategies and extreme parameter reduction.

Abstract: We systematically evaluate Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods under the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). RLVR incentivizes language models to enhance their reasoning capabilities through verifiable feedback; however, while methods like LoRA are commonly used, the optimal PEFT architecture for RLVR remains unidentified. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results challenge the default adoption of standard LoRA with three main findings. First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization. Furthermore, our ablations reveal that extreme parameter reduction (\textit{e.g.,} VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity. We further conduct ablation studies and scaling experiments to validate our findings. This work provides a definitive guide for advocating for more exploration for parameter-efficient RL methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LightONS is a variant of ONS that reduces runtime while maintaining optimal regret, solving an open problem in SXO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of ONS in OX and SXO, particularly the high cost of Mahalanobis projections.

Method: Proposes LightONS, which delays expensive projections using domain-conversion techniques to reduce runtime.

Result: Achieves runtime of O(d²T + dω√T log T) with optimal O(d log T) regret, and answers the COLT'13 open problem.

Conclusion: LightONS efficiently balances computational cost and performance, applicable beyond regret minimization.

Abstract: Online eXp-concave Optimization (OXO) is a fundamental problem in online learning. The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $ω\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \tilde{O}(d/ε)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $ε$, and thereby necessitates an $\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$.
  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\sqrt{T \log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with large-scale unstructured meshes and complex geometries in PDE modeling, often losing critical boundary information due to geometric aliasing.

Method: PGOT uses SpecGeo-Attention to preserve multi-scale geometric features with linear complexity and dynamically routes computations based on spatial coordinates for adaptive modeling.

Result: PGOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks and excels in large-scale industrial tasks like airfoil and car designs.

Conclusion: PGOT effectively integrates geometry awareness into physical feature learning, solving key challenges in PDE modeling for complex geometries.

Abstract: While Transformers have demonstrated remarkable potential in modeling Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), modeling large-scale unstructured meshes with complex geometries remains a significant challenge. Existing efficient architectures often employ feature dimensionality reduction strategies, which inadvertently induces Geometric Aliasing, resulting in the loss of critical physical boundary information. To address this, we propose the Physics-Geometry Operator Transformer (PGOT), designed to reconstruct physical feature learning through explicit geometry awareness. Specifically, we propose Spectrum-Preserving Geometric Attention (SpecGeo-Attention). Utilizing a ``physics slicing-geometry injection" mechanism, this module incorporates multi-scale geometric encodings to explicitly preserve multi-scale geometric features while maintaining linear computational complexity $O(N)$. Furthermore, PGOT dynamically routes computations to low-order linear paths for smooth regions and high-order non-linear paths for shock waves and discontinuities based on spatial coordinates, enabling spatially adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling. PGOT achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across four standard benchmarks and excels in large-scale industrial tasks including airfoil and car designs.

*Ziru Niu,Hai Dong,A. K. Qin,Tao Gu,Pengcheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOLF improves Federated Learning efficiency by freezing layers in order and using TOA, achieving higher accuracy and lower resource use than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL faces challenges due to IoT devices' limited resources; existing solutions compromise accuracy or overlook memory constraints.

Method: FedOLF freezes layers in a predefined order and employs Tensor Operation Approximation to reduce overheads.

Result: FedOLF outperforms existing methods in accuracy (e.g., up to 6.4% higher) while being more energy- and memory-efficient.

Conclusion: FedOLF offers a balanced solution for FL on resource-constrained IoT devices, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph federated learning faces unfairness issues due to imbalanced overlapping subgraphs, which harms cross-client fairness despite potential benefits in mitigating data heterogeneity.

Method: FairGFL uses an interpretable weighted aggregation approach leveraging privacy-preserving overlap ratios and integrates a regularizer into the federated loss function.

Result: FairGFL outperforms four baseline algorithms on four benchmark datasets in both model utility and fairness.

Conclusion: FairGFL effectively balances fairness and utility in graph federated learning, addressing the overlooked issue of imbalanced overlaps.

Abstract: Graph federated learning enables the collaborative extraction of high-order information from distributed subgraphs while preserving the privacy of raw data. However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PFed-Signal improves ADR prediction accuracy by using federated learning and Euclidean distance to eliminate biased data from FAERS, outperforming traditional statistical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like ROR and PRR fail to eliminate biased data in FAERS, leading to inaccurate ADR predictions.

Method: PFed-Signal uses Pfed-Split to split data, identifies biased data via Euclidean distance, and trains a Transformer-based model on cleaned data.

Result: PFed-Signal achieves higher accuracy (0.887), F1 score (0.890), recall (0.913), and AUC (0.957) compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The federated learning approach effectively removes biased data, improving ADR prediction accuracy over traditional statistical methods.

Abstract: The adverse drug reactions (ADRs) predicted based on the biased records in FAERS (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System) may mislead diagnosis online. Generally, such problems are solved by optimizing reporting odds ratio (ROR) or proportional reporting ratio (PRR). However, these methods that rely on statistical methods cannot eliminate the biased data, leading to inaccurate signal prediction. In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction. Specifically, we first propose Pfed-Split, a method to split the original dataset into a split dataset based on ADR. Then we propose ADR-signal, an ADR prediction model, including a biased data identification method based on federated learning and an ADR prediction model based on Transformer. The former identifies the biased data according to the Euclidean distance and generates a clean dataset by deleting the biased data. The latter is an ADR prediction model based on Transformer trained on the clean data set. The results show that the ROR and PRR on the clean dataset are better than those of the traditional methods. Furthermore, the accuracy rate, F1 score, recall rate and AUC of PFed-Signal are 0.887, 0.890, 0.913 and 0.957 respectively, which are higher than the baselines.

TL;DR: HC-PINNs enforce boundary conditions via a trial function, altering the learning landscape. A Neural Tangent Kernel framework shows boundary functions act as spectral filters, influencing training convergence. Spectral analysis identifies effective rank as a predictor of convergence, transforming boundary function design into a spectral optimization problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical mechanisms behind HC-PINNs' training dynamics and provide a rigorous framework for analyzing the impact of boundary functions on learning.

Method: Establishes a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework for HC-PINNs, deriving the kernel composition law. Uses spectral analysis to characterize the impact of boundary functions on the learning landscape.

Result: Boundary functions act as spectral filters, reshaping the kernel's eigenspectrum. Effective rank of the residual kernel predicts convergence, revealing potential spectral collapse from poor boundary function choices.

Conclusion: The framework shifts boundary function design from heuristic to principled spectral optimization, offering a theoretical foundation for hard constraints in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks with hard constraints (HC-PINNs) are increasingly favored for their ability to strictly enforce boundary conditions via a trial function ansatz $\tilde{u} = A + B \cdot N$, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing their training dynamics have remained unexplored.
  Unlike soft-constrained formulations where boundary terms act as additive penalties, this work reveals that the boundary function $B$ introduces a multiplicative spatial modulation that fundamentally alters the learning landscape.
  A rigorous Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework for HC-PINNs is established, deriving the explicit kernel composition law.
  This relationship demonstrates that the boundary function $B(\vec{x})$ functions as a spectral filter, reshaping the eigenspectrum of the neural network's native kernel.
  Through spectral analysis, the effective rank of the residual kernel is identified as a deterministic predictor of training convergence, superior to classical condition numbers.
  It is shown that widely used boundary functions can inadvertently induce spectral collapse, leading to optimization stagnation despite exact boundary satisfaction.
  Validated across multi-dimensional benchmarks, this framework transforms the design of boundary functions from a heuristic choice into a principled spectral optimization problem, providing a solid theoretical foundation for geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning.

TL;DR: Splitwise uses Lyapunov-assisted DRL to adaptively partition LLMs between edge and cloud, optimizing latency, energy, and accuracy while handling bandwidth fluctuations and failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs on edge devices face memory and power limits; cloud-only inference introduces latency and cost. Static partitions fail under bandwidth fluctuations.

Method: Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into smaller blocks for flexible partitioning. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, balances metrics and ensures robustness.

Result: Experiments show Splitwise reduces latency by 1.4x-2.8x, cuts energy by up to 41%, and lowers 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% vs. cloud-only, with maintained accuracy.

Conclusion: Splitwise effectively optimizes LLM deployment across edge and cloud, outperforming existing methods in latency, energy, and robustness.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.

TL;DR: The paper extends vectorized backpropagation principles to transformer-based architectures, focusing on layers like embeddings, multi-headed self-attention, and LoRA, while emphasizing manual derivation for deeper intuition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge gaps in understanding how values propagate in transformer architectures by manually deriving backpropagation, despite the availability of automatic tools.

Method: Applies a lightweight index-free methodology to transformer layers (e.g., embeddings, self-attention) and includes gradient expressions for LoRA layers, complemented by a PyTorch implementation.

Result: Provides analytical expressions for gradient updates in a GPT-like network, demonstrating the effectiveness of manual derivation.

Conclusion: Manual backpropagation offers deeper intuition for transformer architectures, reinforced by practical implementation and gradient analysis.

Abstract: This document is a follow-up to our previous paper dedicated to a vectorized derivation of backpropagation in CNNs. Following the same principles and notations already put in place there, we now focus on transformer-based next-token-prediction architectures. To this end, we apply our lightweight index-free methodology to new types of layers such as embedding, multi-headed self-attention and layer normalization. In addition, we also provide gradient expressions for LoRA layers to illustrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Why bother doing manual backpropagation when there are so many tools that do this automatically? Any gap in understanding of how values propagate forward will become evident when attempting to differentiate the loss function. By working through the backward pass manually, we gain a deeper intuition for how each operation influences the final output. A complete PyTorch implementation of a minimalistic GPT-like network is also provided along with analytical expressions for of all of its gradient updates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECG-RAMBA separates ECG morphology and rhythm, integrating them via context-aware fusion to improve classification robustness across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite deep learning's success in ECG classification, generalization across heterogeneous settings remains challenging due to entangled waveform and rhythm dynamics.

Method: ECG-RAMBA uses deterministic morphological features (MiniRocket), global rhythm descriptors (HRV), and long-range contextual modeling (bi-directional Mamba), with Power Mean pooling ($Q=3$) for transient abnormalities.

Result: Achieves macro ROC-AUC ≈0.85 on Chapman--Shaoxing and PR-AUC=0.708 for atrial fibrillation detection in zero-shot transfer on CPSC-2021, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Separating morphology and rhythm, combined with long-range context, enhances cross-domain robustness in ECG classification.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved strong performance for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification within individual datasets, yet dependable generalization across heterogeneous acquisition settings remains a major obstacle to clinical deployment and longitudinal monitoring. A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL. Ablation studies indicate that deterministic morphology provides a strong foundation, while explicit rhythm modeling and long-range context are critical drivers of cross-domain robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require multiple gradient steps with importance ratio clipping, which can be inefficient. ISOPO aims to simplify and speed up natural policy gradient approximation.

Method: ISOPO normalizes log-probability gradients in the Fisher metric before contracting with advantages. A variant uses the neural tangent kernel to transform microbatch advantages layer-wise.

Result: ISOPO achieves efficient approximation in a single backward pass with negligible overhead compared to vanilla REINFORCE.

Conclusion: ISOPO offers a computationally efficient alternative to existing proximal policy methods.

Abstract: This note introduces Isometric Policy Optimization (ISOPO), an efficient method to approximate the natural policy gradient in a single gradient step. In comparison, existing proximal policy methods such as GRPO or CISPO use multiple gradient steps with variants of importance ratio clipping to approximate a natural gradient step relative to a reference policy. In its simplest form, ISOPO normalizes the log-probability gradient of each sequence in the Fisher metric before contracting with the advantages. Another variant of ISOPO transforms the microbatch advantages based on the neural tangent kernel in each layer. ISOPO applies this transformation layer-wise in a single backward pass and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead compared to vanilla REINFORCE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a low-bit quantization framework for Huawei's openPangu-Embedded models to reduce memory and latency overheads caused by Chain-of-Thought reasoning modes, achieving efficient performance on Ascend NPUs while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational challenges posed by extended reasoning traces in Huawei's openPangu-Embedded models, particularly memory and latency overheads on Ascend NPUs.

Method: Leveraging low-bit quantization (INT8/W4A8) to transform FP16 computations into efficient integer arithmetic, optimized for Atlas A2 hardware.

Result: INT8 preserves over 90% of FP16 accuracy with a 1.5x prefill speedup; W4A8 reduces memory but trades off some accuracy.

Conclusion: Low-bit quantization enables efficient CoT reasoning on Ascend NPUs while maintaining high model fidelity.

Abstract: Huawei's openPangu-Embedded-1B and openPangu-Embedded-7B, variants of the openPangu large language model, integrate three distinct Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paradigms, namely slow_think, auto_think, and no_think. While these CoT modes enhance reasoning capabilities, their generation of extended reasoning traces introduces substantial memory and latency overheads, posing challenges for practical deployment on Ascend NPUs. This paper addresses these computational constraints by leveraging low-bit quantization, which transforms FP16 computations into more efficient integer arithmetic. We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2. Furthermore, W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption, albeit with a moderate trade-off in accuracy. These findings collectively indicate that low-bit quantization effectively facilitates efficient CoT reasoning on Ascend NPUs, maintaining high model fidelity.

*Xiao Ma,Mohammad Hasyim Taufik,Tariq Alkhalifah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework combining generative models and neural operators to efficiently build high-resolution velocity models, addressing the computational inefficiency of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional velocity model building methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Deep learning, especially generative models and neural operators, offers a promising alternative to overcome these limitations.

Method: The framework uses a neural operator as a forward mapping operator to generate RTM extended images quickly. It integrates a generative model trained on high-resolution velocity distributions as a regularizer for cleaner, higher-resolution predictions.

Result: Experiments with synthetic and field data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator approach in building accurate velocity models efficiently.

Conclusion: The combination of generative models and neural operators provides a scalable and efficient solution for high-resolution velocity model building, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: Velocity model building serves as a crucial component for achieving high precision subsurface imaging. However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unimodal and multimodal methods for log anomaly detection struggle with ignoring log modalities or handling their interactions, prompting the need for a more nuanced approach.

Method: CoLog uses collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among log modalities, along with a modality adaptation layer to handle heterogeneity.

Result: CoLog achieves mean precision of 99.63%, recall of 99.59%, and F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: CoLog advances log anomaly detection by providing a unified and effective solution for detecting point and collective anomalies, making it valuable for cybersecurity and system monitoring.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection is crucial for preserving the security of operating systems. Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses. We also provide the implementation of CoLog at https://github.com/NasirzadehMoh/CoLog.

*Nathan Buskulic,Luca Calatroni,Lorenzo Rosasco,Silvia Villa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses blind inverse problems with unknown forward operators, focusing on Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs) for theoretical guarantees and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind inverse problems lack interpretability and theoretical backing in existing data-driven methods, limiting their reliability in applications like imaging.

Method: Uses LMMSEs within a simplified framework, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and linking them to Tikhonov-regularized formulations.

Result: Provides theoretical guarantees, finite-sample error bounds, and convergence rates, validated by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of blind inverse problems with rigorous theory and demonstrates practical validation.

Abstract: Blind inverse problems arise in many experimental settings where the forward operator is partially or entirely unknown. In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.

TL;DR: FgGSL is a graph structure learning framework that combines frequency information with supervised topology inference to improve GNN performance on heterophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs perform poorly on heterophilic graphs where connected nodes have dissimilar labels, lacking discriminative node representations.

Method: FgGSL jointly learns homophilic and heterophilic graphs using a feature-driven masking function and pre-designed filter banks, guided by a structural loss.

Result: Experiments show FgGSL outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and graph rewiring methods on heterophilic benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining frequency information with supervised topology inference enhances GNN performance for heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to learn discriminative node representations for heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar labels and feature similarity provides weak structural cues. We propose frequency-guided graph structure learning (FgGSL), an end-to-end graph inference framework that jointly learns homophilic and heterophilic graph structures along with a spectral encoder. FgGSL employs a learnable, symmetric, feature-driven masking function to infer said complementary graphs, which are processed using pre-designed low- and high-pass graph filter banks. A label-based structural loss explicitly promotes the recovery of homophilic and heterophilic edges, enabling task-driven graph structure learning. We derive stability bounds for the structural loss and establish robustness guarantees for the filter banks under graph perturbations. Experiments on six heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that FgGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and graph rewiring methods, highlighting the benefits of combining frequency information with supervised topology inference.

*Yusuf Kalyoncuoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to compress deep neural networks by decoupling solution geometry from the ambient search space, enabling significant compression of classification heads with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep neural networks rely on large widths despite low intrinsic dimensionality, primarily due to the non-convex optimization problem. The goal is to bypass this bottleneck.

Method: A constructive approach decouples solution geometry from the search space, allowing compression of classification heads. Subspace-Native Distillation is introduced to define targets directly in the subspace.

Result: Experiments on ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT show classification heads can be compressed by factors up to 16 with negligible performance degradation.

Conclusion: The method enables stable geometric coordinates for student models, potentially eliminating the need for high-dimensional searches, advancing the Train Big, Deploy Small paradigm.

Abstract: While it is well-established that the weight matrices and feature manifolds of deep neural networks exhibit a low Intrinsic Dimension (ID), current state-of-the-art models still rely on massive high-dimensional widths. This redundancy is not required for representation, but is strictly necessary to solve the non-convex optimization search problem-finding a global minimum, which remains intractable for compact networks. In this work, we propose a constructive approach to bypass this optimization bottleneck. By decoupling the solution geometry from the ambient search space, we empirically demonstrate across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT that the classification head can be compressed by even huge factors of 16 with negligible performance degradation. This motivates Subspace-Native Distillation as a novel paradigm: by defining the target directly in this constructed subspace, we provide a stable geometric coordinate system for student models, potentially allowing them to circumvent the high-dimensional search problem entirely and realize the vision of Train Big, Deploy Small.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAMP introduces a stochastic Siamese MAE framework to encode temporal information in longitudinal medical datasets, outperforming existing methods in disease progression prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised learning methods like MAE lack temporal awareness, crucial for capturing disease progression in longitudinal medical datasets.

Method: STAMP uses a Siamese MAE framework conditioned on time differences, reframing the reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective to model temporal dynamics stochastically.

Result: STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models in predicting Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression.

Conclusion: STAMP effectively captures non-deterministic temporal dynamics in longitudinal medical datasets, enhancing disease progression prediction.

Abstract: Temporally aware image representations are crucial for capturing disease progression in 3D volumes of longitudinal medical datasets. However, recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches like Masked Autoencoding (MAE), despite their strong representation learning capabilities, lack temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases.

TL;DR: DSC reduces parameter complexity and memory traffic in MoE models while avoiding collapse and instability, using dynamic subspace composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address representation collapse and gradient instability in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Subspace Composition (DSC), approximating context-dependent weights via a sparse expansion of a shared basis bank, with magnitude-gated simplex interpolation.

Result: Reduces parameter complexity to O(M d) and memory traffic to O(Kd).

Conclusion: DSC offers efficient, stable scaling for MoE models with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models scale capacity but often suffer from representation collapse and gradient instability. We propose Dynamic Subspace Composition (DSC), a framework that approximates context-dependent weights via a state-dependent, sparse expansion of a shared basis bank. Formally, DSC models the weight update as a residual trajectory within a Star- Shaped Domain, employing a Magnitude-Gated Simplex Interpolation to ensure continuity at the identity. Unlike standard Mixture-of-LoRAs, which incurs O(M rd) parameter complexity by retrieving independent rank-r matrices, DSC constructs a compositional rank-K approximation from decoupled unit-norm basis vectors. This reduces parameter complexity to O(M d) and memory traffic to O(Kd), while Frame-Theoretic regularization and spectral constraints provide rigorous worst-case bounds on the dynamic update.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIR, an information-theoretic method to debias reward models (RMs) in RLHF, addressing complex biases like response length and sycophancy, improving generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RM training data often contains inductive biases leading to overfitting and reward hacking. Existing debiasing methods are limited to specific biases or simple correlations.

Method: DIR maximizes mutual information between RM scores and human preferences while minimizing it between RM outputs and biased attributes, inspired by the information bottleneck.

Result: DIR effectively mitigates target biases (response length, sycophancy, format) and enhances RLHF performance across benchmarks, improving generalization.

Conclusion: DIR provides a robust approach to debiasing RMs, handling complex biases and enhancing alignment with human values in RLHF.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RM training data is commonly recognized as low-quality, containing inductive biases that can easily lead to overfitting and reward hacking. For example, more detailed and comprehensive responses are usually human-preferred but with more words, leading response length to become one of the inevitable inductive biases. A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \textbf{D}ebiasing via \textbf{I}nformation optimization for \textbf{R}M (DIR). Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB), we maximize the mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preference pairs, while minimizing the MI between RM outputs and biased attributes of preference inputs. With theoretical justification from information theory, DIR can handle more sophisticated types of biases with non-linear correlations, broadly extending the real-world application scenarios for RM debiasing methods. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \textit{response length}, \textit{sycophancy}, and \textit{format}. We discover that DIR not only effectively mitigates target inductive biases but also enhances RLHF performance across diverse benchmarks, yielding better generalization abilities.

TL;DR: FRoD introduces hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom for efficient fine-tuning, outperforming PEFT methods like LoRA in accuracy while using minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods like LoRA face slow convergence and limited adaptability due to low-rank constraints, hindering performance on diverse tasks.

Method: FRoD combines hierarchical joint decomposition and rotational degrees of freedom, using shared bases and sparse perturbations for flexible full-rank updates.

Result: FRoD matches full fine-tuning accuracy on 20 benchmarks, using only 1.72% of trainable parameters.

Conclusion: FRoD effectively balances efficiency and expressiveness, offering faster convergence and robust performance across tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a practical solution for adapting large foundation models to downstream tasks, reducing computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of parameters. Among them, approaches like LoRA aim to strike a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but often suffer from slow convergence and limited adaptation capacity due to their inherent low-rank constraints. This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence. On 20 benchmarks spanning vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD matches full model fine-tuning in accuracy, while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under identical training budgets.

Motivation: Address challenges of imperfect CSI, sample imbalance, and TD3 sensitivity in URLLC networks to enhance convergence and sum-rate performance.

Method: BO-driven TD3 algorithm adaptively determines device order and MCS, aided by BO-based training for improved convergence and sample selection.

Result: Achieves faster convergence and higher sum-rate compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively optimizes URLLC in IIoT networks with imperfect CSI.

Abstract: In this article, we consider an industrial internet of things (IIoT) network supporting multi-device dynamic ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while the channel state information (CSI) is imperfect. A joint link adaptation (LA) and device scheduling (including the order) design is provided, aiming at maximizing the total transmission rate under strict block error rate (BLER) constraints. In particular, a Bayesian optimization (BO) driven Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method is proposed, which determines the device served order sequence and the corresponding modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptively based on the imperfect CSI. Note that the imperfection of CSI, error sample imbalance in URLLC networks, as well as the parameter sensitivity nature of the TD3 algorithm likely diminish the algorithm's convergence speed and reliability. To address such an issue, we proposed a BO based training mechanism for the convergence speed improvement, which provides a more reliable learning direction and sample selection method to track the imbalance sample problem. Via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and higher sum-rate performance compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: The paper aims to improve AI's robustness and reliability under distribution shifts, addressing critical challenges for trustworthy ML systems.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has been a foundational topic in artificial intelligence (AI), providing both theoretical groundwork and practical tools for its exciting advancements. From ResNet for visual recognition to Transformer for vision-language alignment, the AI models have achieved superior capability to humans. Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability. We carefully study the three common distribution shifts into: (1) Perturbation Shift, (2) Domain Shift, and (3) Modality Shift. For all scenarios, we also rigorously investigate trustworthiness via three aspects: (1) Robustness, (2) Explainability, and (3) Adaptability. Based on these dimensions, we propose effective solutions and fundamental insights, meanwhile aiming to enhance the critical ML problems, such as efficiency, adaptability, and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective human-machine interaction relies on accurate emotion recognition, but EEG data variability across sessions hampers model generalization.

Method: Proposed EGDA aligns global and class-specific distributions with graph regularization to preserve EEG data structure.

Result: EGDA outperforms baselines, achieving 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% accuracy on SEED-IV dataset transfer tasks; Gamma band and central-parietal/prefrontal regions identified as key discriminators.

Conclusion: EGDA successfully addresses cross-session EEG variability, enhancing emotion recognition performance.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of human emotional states is critical for effective human-machine interaction. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a reliable source for emotion recognition due to its high temporal resolution and its direct reflection of neural activity. Nevertheless, variations across recording sessions present a major challenge for model generalization. To address this issue, we propose EGDA, a framework that reduces cross-session discrepancies by jointly aligning the global (marginal) and class-specific (conditional) distributions, while preserving the intrinsic structure of EEG data through graph regularization. Experimental results on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that EGDA achieves robust cross-session performance, obtaining accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% across three transfer tasks, and surpassing several baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the Gamma frequency band as the most discriminative and identifies the central-parietal and prefrontal brain regions as critical for reliable emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework improves SPC reliability and adaptability in complex environments without sacrificing interpretability.

Abstract: Traditional Statistical Process Control (SPC) is essential for quality management but is limited by its reliance on often violated statistical assumptions, leading to unreliable monitoring in modern, complex manufacturing environments. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that enhances SPC by integrating the distribution free, model agnostic guarantees of Conformal Prediction. We propose two novel applications: Conformal-Enhanced Control Charts, which visualize process uncertainty and enable proactive signals like 'uncertainty spikes', and Conformal-Enhanced Process Monitoring, which reframes multivariate control as a formal anomaly detection problem using an intuitive p-value chart. Our framework provides a more robust and statistically rigorous approach to quality control while maintaining the interpretability and ease of use of classic methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlighting flaws in UDA's symmetric divergence minimization, the study focuses on preventing catastrophic negative transfer in safety-critical applications like medical imaging and autonomous systems.

Method: Introduces Le Cam Distortion, using Le Cam's theory to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability, quantified by Deficiency Distance for conditional transfer risk.

Result: Achieves near-perfect genomics frequency estimation, zero source utility loss in image classification, and safe RL policy transfer compared to catastrophic failure in invariance-based methods.

Conclusion: Le Cam Distortion offers a principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning, avoiding negative transfer in critical domains.

Abstract: Distribution shift is the defining challenge of real-world machine learning. The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing "negative transfer" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].
  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.

Conclusion: Automatically discovered hierarchical agent systems improve generalization for challenging SWE tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning and coding capabilities, yet they struggle to generalize to real-world software engineering (SWE) problems that are long-horizon and out of distribution. Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolithic designs force the model to retain irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. Motivated by how human engineers decompose complex problems, we propose structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks such as localization, editing, and validation. The challenge lies in discovering effective hierarchies automatically: as the number of sub-agents grows, the search space becomes combinatorial, and it is difficult to attribute credit to individual sub-agents within a team. We address these challenges by formulating hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness when collaborating with others. This framework, termed Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), enables efficient exploration of sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets. On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems. On SWE-bench-Live, featuring more recent and out-of-distribution issues, our 36B system ranks second on the leaderboard at the time of evaluation, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude. These results demonstrate that automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems significantly improve generalization on challenging long-horizon SWE tasks.

### [384] [Random Controlled Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23670)
*Francesco Piatti,Thomas Cass,William F. Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework combines random features with controlled differential equations (CDEs) for efficient time-series learning, proposing variants RF-CDEs and R-RDEs for kernel-free approximations and rough-path inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias for time-series learning by training only a linear readout layer.

Method: Uses large randomly parameterized CDEs as reservoirs, proposes RF-CDEs (random Fourier features) and R-RDEs (rough-path inputs with log-ODE discretization).

Result: Achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, offering efficiency and inductive bias without explicit signature computations.

Conclusion: Provides a practical alternative leveraging random features, CDEs, and path-signature theory for efficient time-series modeling.

Abstract: We introduce a training-efficient framework for time-series learning that combines random features with controlled differential equations (CDEs). In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory.
  We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These methods provide a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining their inductive bias while benefiting from the efficiency of random features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new approach to long-context language modeling using continual learning and meta-learning achieves scalable performance with constant inference latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address long-context language modeling by framing it as a continual learning problem rather than focusing on architectural changes.

Method: Uses a standard Transformer with sliding-window attention, leveraging next-token prediction at test time and meta-learning at training time.

Result: The method (TTT-E2E) scales similarly to full-attention Transformers but maintains constant inference latency, being 2.7x faster for 128K contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively combines continual learning and meta-learning for efficient long-context modeling.

Abstract: We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.

*Teja Chinthala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bidirectional RAG introduces dynamic corpus expansion via validated write-back of responses, improving coverage by 40.58% while adding fewer documents than naive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance RAG systems by allowing them to learn from user interactions safely and dynamically, avoiding issues like hallucination pollution.

Method: Employs a multi-stage acceptance layer (NLI-based entailment, attribution checking, novelty detection) for validated write-back.

Result: Achieves nearly double the coverage (40.58%) of Standard RAG (20.33%) with fewer documents added (140 vs 500).

Conclusion: Self-improving RAG is feasible and safe with rigorous validation, enabling systems to learn from deployment.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG systems enhance large language models by grounding responses in external knowledge bases, but conventional RAG architectures operate with static corpora that cannot evolve from user interactions. We introduce Bidirectional RAG, a novel RAG architecture that enables safe corpus expansion through validated write back of high quality generated responses. Our system employs a multi stage acceptance layer combining grounding verification (NLI based entailment, attribution checking, and novelty detection to prevent hallucination pollution while enabling knowledge accumulation. Across four datasets Natural Questions, TriviaQA, HotpotQA, Stack Overflow with three random seeds 12 experiments per system, Bidirectional RAG achieves 40.58% average coverage nearly doubling Standard RAG 20.33% while adding 72% fewer documents than naive write back 140 vs 500. Our work demonstrates that self improving RAG is feasible and safe when governed by rigorous validation, offering a practical path toward RAG systems that learn from deployment.

*Vincent Chang,Thee Ho,Sunishchal Dev,Kevin Zhu,Shi Feng,Kellin Pelrine,Matthew Kowal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores unprompted persuasion risks in LLMs, finding that supervised fine-tuning increases persuasion tendencies even on harmful topics, unlike activation steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when LLMs might persuade users without explicit prompts, focusing on emergent risks.

Method: Studied unprompted persuasion via internal activation steering and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on trait-related datasets.

Result: SFT reliably increases persuasion tendencies, even spreading to harmful topics, while steering does not.

Conclusion: Emergent harmful persuasion risks exist and warrant further study, especially via SFT methods.

Abstract: With the wide-scale adoption of conversational AI systems, AI are now able to exert unprecedented influence on human opinion and beliefs. Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.

*Ryan Spencer,Roey Yaari,Ritvik Vemavarapu,Joyce Yang,Steven Ngo,Utkarsh Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GamiBench is a benchmark evaluating MLLMs' spatial reasoning via origami tasks, revealing gaps despite their proficiency in perception and instruction-following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook the sequential, viewpoint-dependent nature of spatial reasoning, a critical human intelligence skill.

Method: Introduces GamiBench with 186 regular and impossible 2D-to-3D folding patterns across six viewpoints and three VQA tasks, assessing process holistically.

Result: Leading models like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle with single-step spatial understanding.

Conclusion: GamiBench provides a standardized framework for assessing spatial reasoning in MLLMs, highlighting current limitations.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proficient in perception and instruction-following, but they still struggle with spatial reasoning: the ability to mentally track and manipulate objects across multiple views and over time. Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding. These contributions establish a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs. Dataset and code: https://github.com/stvngo/GamiBench.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fairness-aware AI framework for post-flood aid allocation in Bangladesh, reducing biases against marginalized regions while maintaining predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address systematic biases in post-disaster aid distribution that disadvantage vulnerable regions, perpetuating inequities.

Method: Develops an adversarial debiasing model using fairness-aware representation learning and gradient reversal layers to predict flood vulnerability while removing biases.

Result: Reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6%, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2%, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784).

Conclusion: Demonstrates how algorithmic fairness can improve equitable disaster recovery strategies in humanitarian contexts.

Abstract: Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations often suffers from systematic biases that disadvantage vulnerable regions, perpetuating historical inequities. This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Agentic Risk & Capability (ARC) Framework for governing AI systems autonomously performing tasks like code execution and internet interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of identifying, assessing, and mitigating diverse risks posed by autonomous AI systems in organizations.

Method: Develops a capability-centric perspective, identifies three risk sources (components, design, capabilities), links risks to controls, and offers practical implementation.

Result: A robust and adaptable framework enabling organizations to innovate safely with agentic AI systems.

Conclusion: The ARC Framework provides a structured approach for effective governance and responsible deployment of agentic AI.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems present both significant opportunities and novel risks due to their capacity for autonomous action, encompassing tasks such as code execution, internet interaction, and file modification. This poses considerable challenges for effective organizational governance, particularly in comprehensively identifying, assessing, and mitigating diverse and evolving risks. To tackle this, we introduce the Agentic Risk \& Capability (ARC) Framework, a technical governance framework designed to help organizations identify, assess, and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI systems. The framework's core contributions are: (1) it develops a novel capability-centric perspective to analyze a wide range of agentic AI systems; (2) it distills three primary sources of risk intrinsic to agentic AI systems - components, design, and capabilities; (3) it establishes a clear nexus between each risk source, specific materialized risks, and corresponding technical controls; and (4) it provides a structured and practical approach to help organizations implement the framework. This framework provides a robust and adaptable methodology for organizations to navigate the complexities of agentic AI, enabling rapid and effective innovation while ensuring the safe, secure, and responsible deployment of agentic AI systems.

*Paul Schneider,Amalie Schramm*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Structured deliberation among diverse LLMs improves forecasting accuracy, especially in groups with shared information, reducing Log Loss by 4%. Homogeneous groups show no benefit, and additional context doesn't help.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if structured deliberation, effective for human forecasters, can enhance accuracy in LLMs by allowing them to review each other's forecasts.

Method: Tested accuracy across four scenarios using resolved binary questions from Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament, involving diverse/homogeneous LLMs with shared/distributed information.

Result: Significant accuracy improvement in scenario 2 (diverse models with shared information), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 (4%). No benefit for homogeneous groups or with added context.

Conclusion: Deliberation is a viable strategy for improving LLM forecasting accuracy, particularly among diverse models with shared information.

Abstract: Structured deliberation has been found to improve the performance of human forecasters. This study investigates whether a similar intervention, i.e. allowing LLMs to review each other's forecasts before updating, can improve accuracy in large language models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini Pro 2.5). Using 202 resolved binary questions from the Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament, accuracy was assessed across four scenarios: (1) diverse models with distributed information, (2) diverse models with shared information, (3) homogeneous models with distributed information, and (4) homogeneous models with shared information. Results show that the intervention significantly improves accuracy in scenario (2), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 or about 4 percent in relative terms (p = 0.017). However, when homogeneous groups (three instances of the same model) engaged in the same process, no benefit was observed. Unexpectedly, providing LLMs with additional contextual information did not improve forecast accuracy, limiting our ability to study information pooling as a mechanism. Our findings suggest that deliberation may be a viable strategy for improving LLM forecasting.

*Adrien Pavão*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Humans struggle to reliably distinguish AI-generated images from real ones, with only slightly better-than-random accuracy (54%). The study highlights the growing difficulty and ethical concerns as AI media becomes more realistic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that people can easily differentiate AI-generated images from real photographs, given the increasing prevalence of synthetic media online.

Method: An interactive web experiment where 165 participants classified 20 images (real from CC12M and AI-generated from MidJourney) in 233 sessions, measuring accuracy and response times.

Result: Average accuracy was only 54%, barely above random chance, with limited improvement over repeated attempts. Some images were consistently more deceptive.

Conclusion: Human judgment alone is inadequate for detecting AI-generated content, underscoring the need for awareness and ethical guidelines as synthetic media becomes more indistinguishable.

Abstract: AI-generated images are now pervasive online, yet many people believe they can easily tell them apart from real photographs. We test this assumption through an interactive web experiment where participants classify 20 images as real or AI-generated. Our dataset contains 120 difficult cases: real images sampled from CC12M, and carefully curated AI-generated counterparts produced with MidJourney. In total, 165 users completed 233 sessions. Their average accuracy was 54%, only slightly above random guessing, with limited improvement across repeated attempts. Response times averaged 7.3 seconds, and some images were consistently more deceptive than others. These results indicate that, even on relatively simple portrait images, humans struggle to reliably detect AI-generated content. As synthetic media continues to improve, human judgment alone is becoming insufficient for distinguishing real from artificial data. These findings highlight the need for greater awareness and ethical guidelines as AI-generated media becomes increasingly indistinguishable from reality.

TL;DR: SPIRAL integrates three LLM agents into MCTS, enabling guided, self-correcting planning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex planning due to linear reasoning and lack of self-correction, while traditional search methods are inefficient without leveraging LLMs' semantics.

Method: SPIRAL combines Planner, Simulator, and Critic LLM agents within MCTS to propose steps, predict outcomes, and provide dense rewards, enhancing search efficiency.

Result: SPIRAL achieves 83.6% accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, a 16-point improvement over competitors, and shows superior token efficiency.

Conclusion: Guided, reflective, and grounded search transforms LLM reasoning into robust, efficient planning, as demonstrated by SPIRAL's success.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often falter at complex planning tasks that require exploration and self-correction, as their linear reasoning process struggles to recover from early mistakes. While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency. Our work demonstrates that structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' unreliability in tasks requiring strict rule adherence and auditability.

Method: Introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and rule-based validators for traceable outputs.

Result: LSP achieves higher accuracy (0.83-0.89) and F1 scores (0.83-0.89) than other prompting methods.

Conclusion: LSP enhances determinism and interpretability without compromising performance, suitable for critical systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language reasoning but remain unreliable on tasks requiring strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability. Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) is a lightweight prompting framework that introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and a rule based validator that produces traceable and repeatable outputs. Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75). McNemar tests show statistically significant gains for LSP across nearly all comparisons (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that LSP improves determinism, interpretability, and consistency without sacrificing performance, supporting its use in clinical, regulated, and safety critical decision support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for training LLMs to generate symbolic world models lack large-scale verifiable supervision and often fail to catch behavior-level errors during interactive execution.

Method: Agent2World employs a three-stage pipeline: (i) Deep Researcher synthesizes knowledge via web search, (ii) Model Developer implements executable models, and (iii) Testing Team validates through adaptive testing and simulations.

Result: The framework achieves superior performance on benchmarks (PDDL and code representations) and improves model generation by 30.95% after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Agent2World effectively addresses supervision gaps and enhances world-model generation through multi-agent collaboration and interactive validation.

Abstract: Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tractable subset of numeric planning problems with control parameters and proposes an optimistic compilation method to transform them into simpler tasks, enabling effective use of heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard numeric heuristics fail in numeric planning with control parameters due to infinite action possibilities. The authors aim to address this limitation.

Method: They identify controllable, simple numeric problems and transform them using an optimistic compilation approach, abstracting control-dependent expressions into bounded effects and relaxed preconditions.

Result: The approach allows effective use of subgoaling heuristics, demonstrating computational feasibility and advancing the state of the art.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully extends traditional numeric heuristics to problems with infinite action possibilities.

Abstract: Numeric planning with control parameters extends the standard numeric planning model by introducing action parameters as free numeric variables that must be instantiated during planning. This results in a potentially infinite number of applicable actions in a state. In this setting, off-the-shelf numeric heuristics that leverage the action structure are not feasible. In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.

*Ozan Oguztuzun,Cerag Oguztuzun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GatedBias is a lightweight framework adapting KG embeddings to individual user preferences without retraining, combining profile-specific features with graph-derived gates for efficient, interpretable personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KG models excel in link prediction but lack personalization, failing to align with individual user preferences.

Method: GatedBias uses structure-gated adaptation, requiring only ~300 parameters, to adjust KG embeddings to user contexts while maintaining global accuracy.

Result: Evaluations on Amazon-Book and Last-FM datasets show significant improvements in alignment metrics without sacrificing cohort performance. Counterfactual experiments confirm causal responsiveness.

Conclusion: GatedBias bridges general KG representations with individual user needs, offering parameter-efficient and causally verifiable personalization.

Abstract: Foundation models for knowledge graphs (KGs) achieve strong cohort-level performance in link prediction, yet fail to capture individual user preferences; a key disconnect between general relational reasoning and personalized ranking. We propose GatedBias, a lightweight inference-time personalization framework that adapts frozen KG embeddings to individual user contexts without retraining or compromising global accuracy. Our approach introduces structure-gated adaptation: profile-specific features combine with graph-derived binary gates to produce interpretable, per-entity biases, requiring only ${\sim}300$ trainable parameters. We evaluate GatedBias on two benchmark datasets (Amazon-Book and Last-FM), demonstrating statistically significant improvements in alignment metrics while preserving cohort performance. Counterfactual perturbation experiments validate causal responsiveness; entities benefiting from specific preference signals show 6--30$\times$ greater rank improvements when those signals are boosted. These results show that personalized adaptation of foundation models can be both parameter-efficient and causally verifiable, bridging general knowledge representations with individual user needs.

*Yifan Zhang,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a formal paradigm using algebraic structures to robustly manage agent workflows, addressing brittleness in current architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agent architectures suffer from brittleness due to ad hoc designs, leading to issues like poor state management and error handling.

Method: MCE uses Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to structure agent workflows, with Monad Transformers for systematic composition.

Result: MCE enables robust sequential and parallel execution, resilient agents, and generative orchestration via Meta-Agents.

Conclusion: MCE offers a principled, layered approach for designing complex, efficient, and verifiable AI agents.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

### [402] [Multi-AI Agent Framework Reveals the "Oxide Gatekeeper" in Aluminum Nanoparticle Oxidation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22529)
*Yiming Lu,Tingyu Lu,Di Zhang,Lili Ye,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'human-in-the-loop' AI framework to overcome computational bottlenecks in studying aluminum nanoparticles' combustion, revealing dual-mode oxidation mechanisms and resolving a long-standing debate on mass transfer dominance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The atomic mechanisms of aluminum nanoparticles' transition from passivated to explosive states are poorly understood due to limitations in computational methods, necessitating a new approach.

Method: A closed-loop framework combines AI agents and human oversight to validate a machine learning potential, achieving quantum accuracy and scalability for large systems.

Result: The study identifies temperature-regulated oxidation modes ('breathing' and 'rupture') and proves aluminum cation diffusion dominates mass transfer, resolving prior controversies.

Conclusion: The framework provides atomic-scale insights for designing energetic nanomaterials, enabling precise control over ignition sensitivity and energy release.

Abstract: Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a "human-in-the-loop" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic "gatekeeper," regulating oxidation through a "breathing mode" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a "rupture mode" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.

*Rajesh P. N. Rao,Vishwas Sathish,Linxing Preston Jiang,Matthew Bryan,Prashant Rangarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates integrating actions, hierarchical structure, and episodic memory into foundation models to enhance safety, interpretability, and efficiency, inspired by neuroscience and cognitive science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models lack key components of predictive coding models (actions, hierarchy, and memory), leading to deficiencies like hallucinations and inefficiency. The goal is to improve AI by bridging neuroscience and AI insights.

Method: Proposes integrating actions, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory into foundation models, supported by neuroscience evidence. Compares this approach to existing enhancements like CoT and RAG.

Result: Argues that incorporating these components can address hallucinations, grounding issues, lack of agency, and inefficiency in current models.

Conclusion: A collaboration between brain science and AI could lead to safer, more interpretable, and human-like AI systems.

Abstract: The phenomenal advances in large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models over the past few years have been based on optimizing large-scale transformer models on the surprisingly simple objective of minimizing next-token prediction loss, a form of predictive coding that is also the backbone of an increasingly popular model of brain function in neuroscience and cognitive science. However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SANet is a semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that optimizes multi-agent collaboration by inferring user goals and balancing conflicting objectives, achieving significant performance gains with reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the decentralized nature of AgentNet, where agents may have conflicting objectives, by proposing SANet to achieve Pareto-optimal solutions and efficient resource utilization.

Method: The authors formulate SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, introduce three novel metrics, and develop a MoPS framework for partitioning and sharing large models among agents. They also propose two decentralized optimization algorithms and derive theoretical bounds.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate SANet's performance gains (up to 14.61%) and reduced computational requirements (44.37% of FLOPs compared to state-of-the-art algorithms).

Conclusion: SANet effectively balances optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors in AgentNet, offering a scalable and efficient solution for wireless network management.

Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm in which a large number of specialized AI agents collaborate to perform autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex missions. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes M³ob, a multi-modal spatial-temporal method leveraging LLMs-enhanced knowledge graphs for improved mobility prediction and location recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobility prediction methods lack generalization, with unimodal approaches limited by data sparsity and biases, and multi-modal methods failing to capture spatial-temporal dynamics due to semantic gaps.

Method: Constructs a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) using LLMs-enhanced STKG, fuses multi-modal graph representations via a gating mechanism, and aligns cross-modal data with STKG guidance.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements in normal scenarios and strong generalization in abnormal scenarios across six public datasets.

Conclusion: M³ob effectively addresses generalization issues in mobility prediction by integrating multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The precise prediction of human mobility has produced significant socioeconomic impacts, such as location recommendations and evacuation suggestions. However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Mob}ility (\textbf{M}$^3$\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

TL;DR: SimVC-CAS is a novel multi-agent system simulating VC decision-making, improving startup success prediction by capturing collective investor dynamics and enterprise fundamentals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing startup success prediction models overlook collective investor dynamics, focusing on single decision-makers despite real-world VC being a group process.

Method: SimVC-CAS uses role-playing agents and a GNN-based interaction module to simulate VC decisions, incorporating investor traits and co-investment networks.

Result: The system achieves a 25% relative improvement in predictive accuracy (precision@10) using real-world PitchBook data, with interpretable reasoning.

Conclusion: SimVC-CAS enhances startup success prediction by modeling group decision-making, offering insights for other complex group decision scenarios.

Abstract: Due to the high value and high failure rate of startups, predicting their success has become a critical challenge across interdisciplinary research. Existing approaches typically model success prediction from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital (VC) decisions. In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios.

TL;DR: DICE introduces an explainable, efficient evaluation framework for RAG systems, outperforming existing metrics with 85.7% human agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluation metrics are limited in interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and efficiency, hindering responsible deployment.

Method: DICE uses a two-stage framework with probabilistic scoring and a Swiss-system tournament for efficiency.

Result: DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts and reduces computational complexity by 42.9%.

Conclusion: DICE provides a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for assessing RAG systems.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems evolve toward more sophisticated architectures, ensuring their trustworthiness through explainable and robust evaluation becomes critical. Existing scalar metrics suffer from limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies. We introduce DICE (Discrete Interpretable Comparative Evaluation), a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework that advances explainability and robustness in RAG evaluation. DICE combines deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic $\{A, B, Tie\}$ scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments that support accountable system improvement through interpretable reasoning traces, enabling systematic error diagnosis and actionable insights. To address efficiency challenges at scale, DICE employs a Swiss-system tournament that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$, achieving a 42.9% reduction in our eight-system evaluation while preserving ranking fidelity. Validation on a curated Chinese financial QA dataset demonstrates that DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts, substantially outperforming existing LLM-based metrics such as RAGAS. Our results establish DICE as a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for trustworthy RAG system assessment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TravelBench introduces a travel-planning benchmark with multi-turn interaction and tool use, addressing gaps in prior work for comprehensive LLM agent evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing travel-planning tasks lack dynamic interaction and domain coverage, limiting their ability to assess LLM agent capabilities fully.

Method: TravelBench collects real-world user requests and constructs three subsets (multi-turn, single-turn, unsolvable) with a controlled sandbox environment using 10 travel-domain tools for reliable evaluation.

Result: Multiple LLMs are evaluated on TravelBench, revealing insights into their behaviors and performance.

Conclusion: TravelBench provides a practical, reproducible benchmark to advance LLM agents in travel planning.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in planning and tool use. Travel planning provides a natural and high-impact testbed for these capabilities, as it requires multi-step reasoning, iterative preference elicitation through interaction, and calls to external tools under evolving constraints. Prior work has studied LLMs on travel-planning tasks, but existing settings are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction. As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance. TravelBench offers a practical and reproducible benchmark for advancing LLM agents in travel planning.

TL;DR: A framework integrating episodic memory and reinforcement learning enables continual adaptation in language models without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To allow large language model agents to adapt continually through interaction without backpropagation or fine-tuning, leveraging episodic memory.

Method: Introduces the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, modeling reflective learning as a two-stage read-write interaction with memory, formalized as a Markov decision process.

Result: Demonstrates that the process converges to optimal policies as memory coverage improves, supported by entropy-regularised policy iteration and convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical foundation for memory-augmented, retrieval-based language model agents capable of continual adaptation.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for continual and experiential learning in large language model agents that integrates episodic memory with reinforcement learning. The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and limited interpretability in DRL-based portfolio management.

Method: Dynamic asset grouping, hierarchical agents (global and local), utility-based capital allocation, and mask constraints.

Result: Consistently outperforms baselines with at least 5% higher Return, Sharpe, Sortino, and Omega ratios, especially in turbulent markets.

Conclusion: SAMP-HDRL integrates structural market constraints into DRL, enhancing adaptability, robustness, and decision-making transparency.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization in non-stationary markets is challenging due to regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and the limited interpretability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\% higher Return, 5\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.

TL;DR: HiSciBench is a hierarchical benchmark evaluating LLMs across five scientific workflow levels, highlighting gaps in model performance from basic literacy to discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in science are fragmented and narrow, failing to capture the full spectrum of scientific abilities.

Method: HiSciBench curates 8,735 instances across six disciplines, supporting multimodal inputs and cross-lingual evaluation.

Result: Leading models show high accuracy (69%) in basic tasks but drop to 25% in discovery-level challenges.

Conclusion: HiSciBench sets a new standard for evaluating scientific intelligence, guiding development of more reliable models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models has sparked growing interest in their potential for scientific research. However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations of leading models, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and several multimodal systems, reveal substantial performance gaps: while models achieve up to 69\% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, performance declines sharply to 25\% on discovery-level challenges. HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific Intelligence and offers actionable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more reliable. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

*Ling Xin,Mojtaba Nayyeri,Zahra Makki Nayeri,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Gamma introduces a novel multi-head geometric attention foundation model for knowledge graphs, replacing single relational transformations with diverse parallel ones, leading to improved zero-shot inductive link prediction performance over Ultra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches like Ultra rely on a single relational transformation, limiting expressiveness and failing to capture diverse relational patterns. Gamma addresses this by introducing multiple parallel transformations.

Method: Gamma uses multi-head geometric attention with diverse transformations (real, complex, split-complex, dual number) and a relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism for adaptive fusion.

Result: Gamma outperforms Ultra by 5.5% in mean reciprocal rank on inductive benchmarks and 4.4% across all benchmarks.

Conclusion: Gamma's combination of diverse geometric representations enhances expressiveness and performance in zero-shot inductive link prediction.

Abstract: Structural knowledge graph foundation models aim to generalize reasoning to completely new graphs with unseen entities and relations. A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RW-Post, a high-quality dataset for multimodal fact-checking, and AgentFact, an agent-based framework to improve accuracy and interpretability in verifying misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing multimodal fact-checking systems, which lack reasoning and evidence utilization, by providing a dedicated dataset and a human-like verification framework.

Method: Developed RW-Post dataset with annotated reasoning and evidence, and proposed AgentFact, a framework with five specialized agents for collaborative fact-checking tasks.

Result: The combination of RW-Post and AgentFact significantly enhances the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.

Conclusion: The paper offers a robust solution to automate multimodal fact-checking by leveraging high-quality data and an agent-based workflow.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation poses a growing challenge for automated fact-checking systems. Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.

TL;DR: LLM-based tutors are less effective than traditional deep knowledge tracing models in K-12 education, showing lower accuracy and temporal coherence despite fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about LLM-based tutors replacing traditional learner models, especially in high-risk K-12 settings classified by the EU AI Act.

Method: Comparison of deep knowledge tracing (DKT) with LLMs (zero-shot and fine-tuned) using a large open-access dataset.

Result: DKT outperforms LLMs in accuracy and temporal coherence, with fine-tuned LLMs still lagging and exhibiting higher errors.

Conclusion: LLMs alone are insufficient for effective tutoring; hybrid frameworks integrating learner modelling are recommended.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language model (LLM)-based tutors in K--12 education has fostered a misconception that generative models can replace traditional learner modelling for adaptive instruction. This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.

*Fady Rezk,Yuangang Pan,Chuan-Sheng Foo,Xun Xu,Nancy Chen,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reveals that standard reward model (RM) accuracy is ineffective for deploying personalized alignment, introducing policy accuracy as a better metric and exposing flaws in current methods through Pref-LaMP benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalized alignment methods focus on RM accuracy, but this doesn't translate effectively to real-world deployment where reward-guided decoding is used instead of fine-tuning.

Method: The authors evaluate RM accuracy vs. policy accuracy across datasets, introduce Pref-LaMP benchmark, and compare reward-guided methods with in-context learning (ICL).

Result: RM accuracy weakly correlates with policy-level discrimination (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31), and ICL outperforms reward-guided methods for larger models.

Conclusion: The field's reliance on proxy metrics like RM accuracy fails to predict actual deployment performance, necessitating better benchmarks and methods.

Abstract: Personalized alignment from preference data has focused primarily on improving reward model (RM) accuracy, with the implicit assumption that better preference ranking translates to better personalized behavior. However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: ChexReason, a resource-efficient vision-language model trained with SFT and GRPO, shows improved in-distribution performance but suffers in cross-dataset transferability, highlighting a generalization paradox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application of RL advancements for LLMs in medical imaging while addressing resource constraints.

Method: ChexReason is trained using R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) with limited samples (2,000 SFT, 1,000 RL) and a single GPU.

Result: GRPO improves in-distribution performance (23% on CheXpert) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH), revealing a generalization paradox.

Conclusion: Curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations.

Abstract: Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) advances for Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved reasoning tasks, yet their resource-constrained application to medical imaging remains underexplored. We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models. Consequently, curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations.

*Yu Li,Tian Lan,Zhengling Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (Q) addresses limitations in DPO variants by optimizing policies using both context and alternative responses, ensuring better alignment and invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO and its variants have limitations, including dependency on arbitrary modeling choices and failure to leverage comparative data fully, leading to suboptimal alignment.

Method: Proposes Q, which derives globally optimal policies by conditioning on context and alternative responses, ensuring invariance to scalarization and reference choices.

Result: Q shows consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating its effectiveness over DPO/RLHF.

Conclusion: Q enhances alignment robustness by tapping into intrinsic self-reflection, proving superior without architectural changes or inference overhead.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become standard for aligning Large Language Models due to their simplicity and offline stability. However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for refining EI evaluation frameworks for AI, as current ones inadequately measure relevant aspects due to differences between human and artificial EI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EI evaluation frameworks for AI are insufficient because they don't comprehensively address aspects relevant to artificial systems, lacking grounding in emotion theory.

Method: The study reviews emotion and EI theories, assesses applicability to AI, critiques existing benchmark frameworks, and proposes improvements.

Result: Existing benchmark frameworks are found to lack solid theoretical foundations, missing key aspects of EI relevant to AI.

Conclusion: Improved evaluation strategies are needed for AI EI, grounded in better theoretical understanding and tailored to artificial systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop the position that current frameworks for evaluating emotional intelligence (EI) in artificial intelligence (AI) systems need refinement because they do not adequately or comprehensively measure the various aspects of EI relevant in AI. Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems.

*Hongshen Sun,Juanjuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'model belief,' a more efficient measure derived from LLM token-level probabilities, outperforming traditional 'model choice' by reducing variance and computation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practices underutilize LLMs' probabilistic outputs. 'Model belief' aims to extract more information efficiently.

Method: Introduces 'model belief' using LLM token-level probabilities, comparing it to 'model choice' theoretically and empirically.

Result: Model belief is statistically more efficient, reduces computation by ~20x, and predicts ground-truth choices better.

Conclusion: Model belief should replace model choice as the default measure for richer, efficient LLM-generated data analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior, but common practices to use LLM-generated data are inefficient. Treating an LLM's output ("model choice") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes "model belief," a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCEval is a framework evaluating AI's cognitive abilities—cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making—using thermal comfort scenarios. Despite limited exact human alignment, it shows directional consistency and highlights gaps in LLMs' causal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of task-specific benchmarks for LLMs by using thermal comfort, a complex real-world scenario, to assess AI cognitive capabilities.

Method: Initialize LLM agents with virtual personalities, generate clothing/comfort feedback, and validate against thermal comfort databases (ASHRAE, Chinese).

Result: LLM feedback aligns directionally with humans (1 PMV tolerance) but diverges statistically in PMV distributions and performs poorly in discrete classification.

Conclusion: TCEval validates as a Cognitive Turing Test, showing LLMs have basic cross-modal reasoning but lack precise causal understanding, aiding human-centric AI applications.

Abstract: A critical gap exists in LLM task-specific benchmarks. Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings.

TL;DR: The paper highlights limitations of general-purpose AI models in physical control tasks and introduces Agentic Physical AI, a compact language model trained via physics-based validation, showing improved stability and execution reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with accuracy in quantitative physics tasks due to structural limitations, prompting the need for domain-specific solutions like Agentic Physical AI that prioritize outcome-space guarantees.

Method: A 360M-parameter model is trained on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling datasets from 10^3 to 10^5 examples, focusing on physics-based validation for policy optimization.

Result: The model shows improved stability (500x variance reduction) and execution reliability, autonomously rejecting 70% of training distribution and concentrating 95% runtime on a single-bank strategy.

Conclusion: Agentic Physical AI demonstrates superior performance and transferability across physics domains, offering a promising alternative to perception-centric models for safety-critical control tasks.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.

TL;DR: Exploring the link between conformant planning and hyperproperty model-checking, showing mutual reducibility and soundness/completeness of the encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between conformant planning (finding deterministic plans despite non-deterministic effects) and hyperproperty model-checking (verifying properties across multiple execution traces).

Method: Demonstrate reductions between the two problems: hyperproperty model-checking to conformant planning and vice versa, proving soundness and completeness.

Result: Established that conformant planning and hyperproperty model-checking are closely related and mutually reducible.

Conclusion: The study successfully connects these two problems, opening avenues for cross-disciplinary applications.

Abstract: We study the connection of two problems within the planning and verification community: Conformant planning and model-checking of hyperproperties. Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\exists^*\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in LLMs' ability to form spatial mental models for physical-world deployment.

Method: Introduces CubeBench, a diagnostic framework with progressive tasks assessing spatial reasoning, state tracking, and active exploration.

Result: Leading LLMs show 0.00% pass rate on long-horizon tasks, indicating failure in long-term planning.

Conclusion: Highlights critical limitations in LLMs' spatial cognition, suggesting directions for improving physically-grounded agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, while proficient in the digital realm, face a significant gap in physical-world deployment due to the challenge of forming and maintaining a robust spatial mental model. We identify three core cognitive challenges hindering this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation. To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning. We also propose a diagnostic framework to isolate these cognitive bottlenecks by providing external solver tools. By analyzing the failure modes, we provide key insights to guide the development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents.

Motivation: Address limitations of traditional workflow-based agents by enabling autonomous reasoning and tool invocation for complex tasks.

Method: Integrates interleaved thinking, multimodal CoT reasoning, automated pipelines, and auxiliary tools for broad-domain problem-solving.

Result: MindWatcher excels in performance, matches or surpasses larger models, and reveals insights like genetic inheritance in agentic RL.

Conclusion: MindWatcher advances TIR agents with efficient training and robust performance, offering critical insights for future agent development.

Abstract: Traditional workflow-based agents exhibit limited intelligence when addressing real-world problems requiring tool invocation. Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL.

TL;DR: The paper explores continual learning through an embedded agent perspective, proving equivalence to interacting with infinite state-space POMDPs, introduces interactivity as an objective, and shows deep linear networks outperform nonlinear ones in sustaining interactivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of explicit constraints in continual learning by proposing an embedded agent framework.

Method: Introduces a computationally-embedded perspective, proves equivalence to POMDPs, and develops a model-based RL algorithm for interactivity.

Result: Deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity with increased capacity compared to nonlinear networks.

Conclusion: Embedded agent frameworks and linear networks offer promising directions for continual learning scalability.

Abstract: Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that "the world is bigger" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of AI models and diverse hardware landscapes necessitate automated solutions for kernel development, as manual optimization is insufficient.

Method: AKG kernel agent employs a multi-agent system supporting multiple DSLs (Triton, TileLang, CPP, CUDA-C) to automate kernel generation and tuning for various hardware backends.

Result: On KernelBench with Triton DSL, AKG achieves a 1.46× speedup over PyTorch Eager baselines on GPU and NPU backends.

Conclusion: AKG kernel agent effectively addresses the bottleneck in AI kernel development by automating the process, ensuring correctness and portability.

Abstract: Modern AI models demand high-performance computation kernels. The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform. However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets. When evaluated on KernelBench using Triton DSL across GPU and NPU backends, AKG kernel agent achieves an average speedup of 1.46$\times$ over PyTorch Eager baselines implementations, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating kernel development for modern AI workloads.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL struggles with sparse rewards due to initial model limitations in generating constraint-satisfying responses.

Method: HiR employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes, using dual-preference learning (instruction- and response-level) with binary rewards.

Result: HiR shows promising results across instruction-following tasks with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: HiR offers an efficient solution for RL-based LLM alignment, overcoming sparse reward challenges.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions with various constraints. Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

TL;DR: MIRAGE-VC is a framework that improves VC investment predictions by combining graph data with LLM reasoning, addressing path explosion and heterogeneous evidence fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting startup success is complex and relies on diverse data sources, but existing methods lack reasoning capabilities or struggle with modality mismatches.

Method: MIRAGE-VC uses a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework, with an information-gain-driven path retriever and multi-agent architecture for evidence fusion.

Result: The framework achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5 under strict anti-leakage controls.

Conclusion: MIRAGE-VC effectively predicts startup success and has potential applications in other off-graph prediction tasks.

Abstract: Most venture capital (VC) investments fail, while a few deliver outsized returns. Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

TL;DR: The paper explores aligning AI with human values by studying AI assistance and shutdown games, emphasizing reasoning under uncertainty and handling complex preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring AI systems align with human values and remain safe by addressing the AI assistance and shutdown problems.

Method: Studying AI agents through the frameworks of AI assistance (learning human utility functions) and shutdown games (ensuring safe shutdown behavior).

Result: Demonstrates that solving these challenges requires AI agents capable of reasoning under uncertainty and managing incomplete or non-Archimedean preferences.

Conclusion: Alignment of AI with human values necessitates advanced reasoning and preference-handling capabilities in AI systems.

Abstract: How can we ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and remain safe? We can study this problem through the frameworks of the AI assistance and the AI shutdown games. The AI assistance problem concerns designing an AI agent that helps a human to maximise their utility function(s). However, only the human knows these function(s); the AI assistant must learn them. The shutdown problem instead concerns designing AI agents that: shut down when a shutdown button is pressed; neither try to prevent nor cause the pressing of the shutdown button; and otherwise accomplish their task competently. In this paper, we show that addressing these challenges requires AI agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CreativeDC is a prompting method that improves diversity and novelty in LLM-generated educational problems by separating creative exploration and constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Artificial Hivemind effect limits LLMs, producing repetitive educational problems and reducing diversity of thought. CreativeDC aims to address this.

Method: CreativeDC uses a two-phase prompting method inspired by Wallas's creativity theory and Guilford's divergent-convergent thinking, decoupling exploration from constraint satisfaction.

Result: CreativeDC outperforms baselines in diversity and novelty while maintaining utility. It also scales better, generating more distinct problems.

Conclusion: CreativeDC successfully mitigates the Artificial Hivemind effect, enhancing creativity in LLM-generated educational problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significant potential for generating educational questions and problems, enabling educators to create large-scale learning materials. However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.

TL;DR: NeuroSPICE is a PINN-based framework for circuit simulation, solving DAEs via residual minimization, offering unique advantages like surrogate modeling for optimization and handling nonlinear devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a flexible alternative to conventional SPICE for simulating circuits and emerging devices, leveraging the strengths of PINNs.

Method: NeuroSPICE uses PINNs to minimize residual errors in circuit DAEs through backpropagation, modeling waveforms analytically in the time domain.

Result: While not faster or more accurate than SPICE during training, NeuroSPICE excels in surrogate modeling and simulating nonlinear systems like ferroelectric memories.

Conclusion: NeuroSPICE introduces a novel PINN-based approach for circuit simulation, highlighting its advantages in flexibility and handling complex devices.

Abstract: We present NeuroSPICE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for device and circuit simulation. Unlike conventional SPICE, which relies on time-discretized numerical solvers, NeuroSPICE leverages PINNs to solve circuit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) by minimizing the residual of the equations through backpropagation. It models device and circuit waveforms using analytical equations in time domain with exact temporal derivatives. While PINNs do not outperform SPICE in speed or accuracy during training, they offer unique advantages such as surrogate models for design optimization and inverse problems. NeuroSPICE's flexibility enables the simulation of emerging devices, including highly nonlinear systems such as ferroelectric memories.

*Federico Baldo,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: I-PERI is a federated algorithm for causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions, recovering a tighter equivalence class (Φ-MEC) represented by Φ-CPDAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unrealistic assumptions of shared causal models in federated settings and handling client-specific interventions.

Method: Recovers CPDAG of the union of client graphs and orients edges using structural differences from interventions.

Result: Theoretical convergence and privacy guarantees; empirical effectiveness on synthetic data.

Conclusion: I-PERI advances federated causal discovery by accounting for heterogeneous interventions.

Abstract: Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\mathbfΦ$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\mathbfΦ$-CPDAG. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of I-PERI, as well as on its privacy-preserving properties, and present empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Web World Model (WWM), a hybrid approach combining structured web code with generative language models for controllable yet open-ended environments in language agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either restrict environments to rigid databases or sacrifice controllability for unlimited generative worlds. WWM seeks a balance.

Method: WWM uses web code for structured world state and "physics," while LLMs handle context, narratives, and decisions. It includes diverse environments like travel atlas and fictional galaxies.

Result: Demonstrates scalable web stacks as substrates for world models, enabling structured exploration.

Conclusion: WWM bridges the gap between rigid and fully generative world models, offering practical design principles for controllable, limitless environments.

Abstract: Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collab and ReCollab, frameworks leveraging LLMs for ad-hoc teamwork by classifying teammate behaviors and improving adaptation using retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing brittleness in conventional probabilistic models for ad-hoc teamwork under partial observability and limited interaction.

Method: Collab classifies teammate types using trajectory-derived rubrics; ReCollab enhances this with retrieval-augmented generation for stable inference.

Result: Collab effectively identifies teammate types, while ReCollab improves adaptation and achieves Pareto-optimal trade-offs in accuracy and performance.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as behavioral world models for AHT, with retrieval grounding crucial for coordination.

Abstract: Ad-hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to infer the behavior of previously unseen teammates and adapt their policy accordingly. Conventional approaches often rely on fixed probabilistic models or classifiers, which can be brittle under partial observability and limited interaction. Large language models (LLMs) offer a flexible alternative: by mapping short behavioral traces into high-level hypotheses, they can serve as world models over teammate behavior. We introduce \Collab, a language-based framework that classifies partner types using a behavior rubric derived from trajectory features, and extend it to \ReCollab, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to stabilize inference with exemplar trajectories. In the cooperative Overcooked environment, \Collab effectively distinguishes teammate types, while \ReCollab consistently improves adaptation across layouts, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs between classification accuracy and episodic return. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as behavioral world models for AHT and highlight the importance of retrieval grounding in challenging coordination settings.

*Stefan Edelkamp*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper discusses mission planning for multi-agent fleets in undirected graphs, focusing on dynamic goal assignment and conflict resolution, achieving near-optimal solutions in continuous cases and polynomial-time solutions for discrete variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of assigning goals dynamically to agents in multi-agent path-finding scenarios, particularly in undirected graphs, aiming for efficient conflict resolution and optimal routes.

Method: The method involves solving goal assignments autonomously, leveraging global assignment strategies, local assignment problem-solving, path interleaving, and conflict resolution techniques like 'ants-on-the-stick' and kicking agents out of destinations.

Result: The results show that the problem can be solved arbitrarily close to optimal in continuous cases and in polynomial time for discrete variants, despite traditional routing problems being NP-hard.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that dynamic goal assignment and conflict resolution strategies enable efficient multi-agent mission planning, with global strategies significantly reducing conflicts.

Abstract: In this paper, we plan missions for a fleet of agents in undirected graphs, such as grids, with multiple goals. In contrast to regular multi-agent path-finding, the solver finds and updates the assignment of goals to the agents on its own. In the continuous case for a point agent with motions in the Euclidean plane, the problem can be solved arbitrarily close to optimal. For discrete variants that incur node and edge conflicts, we show that it can be solved in polynomial time, which is unexpected, since traditional vehicle routing on general graphs is NP-hard. We implement a corresponding planner that finds conflict-free optimized routes for the agents. Global assignment strategies greatly reduce the number of conflicts, with the remaining ones resolved by elaborating on the concept of ants-on-the-stick, by solving local assignment problems, by interleaving agent paths, and by kicking agents that have already arrived out of their destinations

TL;DR: HPO, a framework using adversarial reasoning, improves pedagogical oversight in LLMs by enforcing structured debates among critics, outperforming GPT-4o with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' failures in pedagogical reasoning, such as sycophancy and overly direct answers, by introducing a reliable, low-compute solution.

Method: HPO adapts structured adversarial synthesis, using specialist agents to distill dialogue context and moderated debates between pedagogical critics.

Result: The 8B-parameter HPO model achieves a Macro F1 of 0.845, outperforming GPT-4o (0.812) by 3.3% with 20 times fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Adversarial reasoning is effective for reliable pedagogical oversight in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automated tutors to address educator shortages; however, they often fail at pedagogical reasoning, frequently validating incorrect student solutions (sycophancy) or providing overly direct answers that hinder learning. We introduce Hierarchical Pedagogical Oversight (HPO), a framework that adapts structured adversarial synthesis to educational assessment. Unlike cooperative multi-agent systems that often drift toward superficial consensus, HPO enforces a dialectical separation of concerns: specialist agents first distill dialogue context, which then grounds a moderated, five-act debate between opposing pedagogical critics. We evaluate this framework on the MRBench dataset of 1,214 middle-school mathematics dialogues. Our 8B-parameter model achieves a Macro F1 of 0.845, outperforming GPT-4o (0.812) by 3.3% while using 20 times fewer parameters. These results establish adversarial reasoning as a critical mechanism for deploying reliable, low-compute pedagogical oversight in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: Addresses sample inefficiency in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Method: Uses reflection and asymmetric clipping mechanisms derived from KL divergence.

Abstract: We propose Multi Agent Reflective Policy Optimization (MARPO) to alleviate the issue of sample inefficiency in multi agent reinforcement learning. MARPO consists of two key components: a reflection mechanism that leverages subsequent trajectories to enhance sample efficiency, and an asymmetric clipping mechanism that is derived from the KL divergence and dynamically adjusts the clipping range to improve training stability. We evaluate MARPO in classic multi agent environments, where it consistently outperforms other methods.

Motivation: To enable end-to-end training of AI systems organized as graphs without restrictive assumptions, leveraging MARL theory.

Method: Introduces Reinforcement Networks, a framework for MARL with agents as DAG vertices, formalizing training/inference and connecting to LevelEnv for reproducibility.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance over MARL baselines in collaborative setups and unifies hierarchical, modular, and graph-structured MARL views.

Conclusion: Reinforcement Networks offers a foundation for scalable, structured MARL, with potential extensions like richer graph morphologies and compositional curricula.

Abstract: Modern AI systems often comprise multiple learnable components that can be naturally organized as graphs. A central challenge is the end-to-end training of such systems without restrictive architectural or training assumptions. Such tasks fit the theory and approaches of the collaborative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) field. We introduce Reinforcement Networks, a general framework for MARL that organizes agents as vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure extends hierarchical RL to arbitrary DAGs, enabling flexible credit assignment and scalable coordination while avoiding strict topologies, fully centralized training, and other limitations of current approaches. We formalize training and inference methods for the Reinforcement Networks framework and connect it to the LevelEnv concept to support reproducible construction, training, and evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several collaborative MARL setups by developing several Reinforcement Networks models that achieve improved performance over standard MARL baselines. Beyond empirical gains, Reinforcement Networks unify hierarchical, modular, and graph-structured views of MARL, opening a principled path toward designing and training complex multi-agent systems. We conclude with theoretical and practical directions - richer graph morphologies, compositional curricula, and graph-aware exploration. That positions Reinforcement Networks as a foundation for a new line of research in scalable, structured MARL.

TL;DR: The paper systematically defines, quantifies, and utilizes heterogeneity in MARL, proposing a new distance metric and dynamic parameter sharing algorithm to improve interpretability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARL lacks a rigorous definition and deeper understanding of heterogeneity, which is fundamental to agent diversity and environmental interactions.

Method: The study categorizes heterogeneity into five types, introduces a heterogeneity distance metric, and designs a dynamic parameter sharing algorithm.

Result: Case studies confirm effective identification/quantification of heterogeneity, and experiments show better interpretability/adaptability compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The methodology enhances understanding of heterogeneity in MARL and promotes practical algorithm development.

Abstract: Heterogeneity is a fundamental property in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which is closely related not only to the functional differences of agents, but also to policy diversity and environmental interactions. However, the MARL field currently lacks a rigorous definition and deeper understanding of heterogeneity. This paper systematically discusses heterogeneity in MARL from the perspectives of definition, quantification, and utilization. First, based on an agent-level modeling of MARL, we categorize heterogeneity into five types and provide mathematical definitions. Second, we define the concept of heterogeneity distance and propose a practical quantification method. Third, we design a heterogeneity-based multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing algorithm as an example of the application of our methodology. Case studies demonstrate that our method can effectively identify and quantify various types of agent heterogeneity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, compared to other parameter sharing baselines, has better interpretability and stronger adaptability. The proposed methodology will help the MARL community gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of heterogeneity, and further promote the development of practical algorithms.

Result: Findings emphasize behaviour coverage's role in validating autonomous systems, identifying optimization areas and proposing an improved pedestrian agent.

Conclusion: The study advances autonomous vehicle testing by enhancing behaviour coverage evaluation, offering insights for safer and more reliable systems.

Abstract: As autonomous vehicle technology advances, ensuring the safety and reliability of these systems becomes paramount. Consequently, comprehensive testing methodologies are essential to evaluate the performance of autonomous vehicles in diverse and complex real-world scenarios. This study focuses on the behaviour coverage analysis of a multi-agent system simulation designed for autonomous vehicle testing, and provides a systematic approach to measure and assess behaviour coverage within the simulation environment. By defining a set of driving scenarios, and agent interactions, we evaluate the extent to which the simulation encompasses a broad range of behaviours relevant to autonomous driving.
  Our findings highlight the importance of behaviour coverage in validating the effectiveness and robustness of autonomous vehicle systems. Through the analysis of behaviour coverage metrics and coverage-based testing, we identify key areas for improvement and optimization in the simulation framework. Thus, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) pedestrian agent is proposed, where its objective function is formulated to encourage \textit{interesting} tests while promoting a more realistic behaviour than other previously studied pedestrian agents. This research contributes to advancing the field of autonomous vehicle testing by providing insights into the comprehensive evaluation of system behaviour in simulated environments. The results offer valuable implications for enhancing the safety, reliability, and performance of autonomous vehicles through rigorous testing methodologies.
