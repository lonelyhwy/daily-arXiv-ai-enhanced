Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeleWorld is a real-time multimodal 4D world modeling framework unifying video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction, achieving long-term consistency and practical interactivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models lack real-time interaction, long-horizon consistency, and dynamic scene memory, limiting their use as practical world models.

Method: TeleWorld uses a generation-reconstruction-guidance paradigm with autoregressive diffusion-based video modeling, Macro-from-Micro Planning, and Distribution Matching Distillation for real-time synthesis.

Result: TeleWorld excels in static/dynamic world understanding, long-term consistency, and real-time efficiency, advancing practical world modeling.

Conclusion: TeleWorld represents a significant step toward interactive, memory-enabled world models for multimodal generation and embodied intelligence.

Abstract: World models aim to endow AI systems with the ability to represent, generate, and interact with dynamic environments in a coherent and temporally consistent manner. While recent video generation models have demonstrated impressive visual quality, they remain limited in real-time interaction, long-horizon consistency, and persistent memory of dynamic scenes, hindering their evolution into practical world models. In this report, we present TeleWorld, a real-time multimodal 4D world modeling framework that unifies video generation, dynamic scene reconstruction, and long-term world memory within a closed-loop system. TeleWorld introduces a novel generation-reconstruction-guidance paradigm, where generated video streams are continuously reconstructed into a dynamic 4D spatio-temporal representation, which in turn guides subsequent generation to maintain spatial, temporal, and physical consistency. To support long-horizon generation with low latency, we employ an autoregressive diffusion-based video model enhanced with Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)--a hierarchical planning method that reduces error accumulation from frame-level to segment-level-alongside efficient Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), enabling real-time synthesis under practical computational budgets. Our approach achieves seamless integration of dynamic object modeling and static scene representation within a unified 4D framework, advancing world models toward practical, interactive, and computationally accessible systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeleWorld achieves strong performance in both static and dynamic world understanding, long-term consistency, and real-time generation efficiency, positioning it as a practical step toward interactive, memory-enabled world models for multimodal generation and embodied intelligence.

*Anne Harrington,A. Sophia Koepke,Shyamgopal Karthik,Trevor Darrell,Alexei A. Efros*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple noise optimization method mitigates mode collapse in text-to-image models while preserving fidelity and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing mode collapse in text-to-image models, which occurs when multiple samples from the same prompt are too similar.

Method: Proposes noise optimization and explores alternative noise initializations with different frequency profiles.

Result: Noise optimization improves generation quality and variety.

Conclusion: Optimizing noise is an effective solution for enhancing diversity in text-to-image models.

Abstract: Contemporary text-to-image models exhibit a surprising degree of mode collapse, as can be seen when sampling several images given the same text prompt. While previous work has attempted to address this issue by steering the model using guidance mechanisms, or by generating a large pool of candidates and refining them, in this work we take a different direction and aim for diversity in generations via noise optimization. Specifically, we show that a simple noise optimization objective can mitigate mode collapse while preserving the fidelity of the base model. We also analyze the frequency characteristics of the noise and show that alternative noise initializations with different frequency profiles can improve both optimization and search. Our experiments demonstrate that noise optimization yields superior results in terms of generation quality and variety.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spatial4D-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on 4D spatial intelligence tasks, revealing their limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether MLLMs can achieve human-level 4D spatial intelligence, which involves perceiving object movements and changes over time.

Method: Developed Spatial4D-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with ~40,000 question-answer pairs across 18 tasks, organized into six cognitive categories.

Result: Benchmarked MLLMs showed significant limitations in 4D spatial reasoning tasks like route planning and action recognition.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides insights into MLLMs' current capabilities and aims to foster development toward human-level 4D spatial intelligence.

Abstract: 4D spatial intelligence involves perceiving and processing how objects move or change over time. Humans naturally possess 4D spatial intelligence, supporting a broad spectrum of spatial reasoning abilities. To what extent can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve human-level 4D spatial intelligence? In this work, we present Spatial4D-Bench, a versatile 4D spatial intelligence benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the 4D spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Unlike existing spatial intelligence benchmarks that are often small-scale or limited in diversity, Spatial4D-Bench provides a large-scale, multi-task evaluation benchmark consisting of ~40,000 question-answer pairs covering 18 well-defined tasks. We systematically organize these tasks into six cognitive categories: object understanding, scene understanding, spatial relationship understanding, spatiotemporal relationship understanding, spatial reasoning and spatiotemporal reasoning. Spatial4D-Bench thereby offers a structured and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the spatial cognition abilities of MLLMs, covering a broad spectrum of tasks that parallel the versatility of human spatial intelligence. We benchmark various state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary MLLMs on Spatial4D-Bench and reveal their substantial limitations in a wide variety of 4D spatial reasoning aspects, such as route plan, action recognition, and physical plausibility reasoning. We hope that the findings provided in this work offer valuable insights to the community and that our benchmark can facilitate the development of more capable MLLMs toward human-level 4D spatial intelligence.

### [4] [Compressed Map Priors for 3D Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00139)
*Brady Zhou,Philipp Krähenbühl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Compressed Map Priors (CMP), a lightweight framework for autonomous vehicles to leverage historical spatial data efficiently, improving 3D object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles often act as if encountering locations for the first time, despite having prior traversal data. The paper aims to use historic data to enhance perception systems.

Method: CMP uses a binarized hashmap to store spatial priors, requiring only 32KB/km², a 20× reduction compared to dense storage, and integrates seamlessly with existing 3D perception systems.

Result: CMP significantly improves 3D object detection on the nuScenes dataset across multiple architectures without extra computational costs.

Conclusion: The CMP framework demonstrates that leveraging compressed historic spatial data enhances autonomous vehicle perception efficiently and effectively.

Abstract: Human drivers rarely travel where no person has gone before. After all, thousands of drivers use busy city roads every day, and only one can claim to be the first. The same holds for autonomous computer vision systems. The vast majority of the deployment area of an autonomous vision system will have been visited before. Yet, most autonomous vehicle vision systems act as if they are encountering each location for the first time. In this work, we present Compressed Map Priors (CMP), a simple but effective framework to learn spatial priors from historic traversals. The map priors use a binarized hashmap that requires only $32\text{KB}/\text{km}^2$, a $20\times$ reduction compared to the dense storage. Compressed Map Priors easily integrate into leading 3D perception systems at little to no extra computational costs, and lead to a significant and consistent improvement in 3D object detection on the nuScenes dataset across several architectures.

*Lawrence Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLASS is a novel architecture combining global and local image views for better AI-generated image detection, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the loss of fine-grained details in AI-generated image detection due to downsampling.

Method: Integrates globally resized views with multiple randomly sampled local crops using attention-based scoring.

Result: Outperforms standard transfer learning using Vision Transformer, ResNet, and ConvNeXt backbones.

Conclusion: GLASS effectively leverages global and local information for improved AI-generated image detection.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative AI has made AI-generated images increasingly realistic and high-resolution. Most AI-generated image detection architectures typically downsample images before inputting them into models, risking the loss of fine-grained details. This paper presents GLASS (Global-Local Attention with Stratified Sampling), an architecture that combines a globally resized view with multiple randomly sampled local crops. These crops are original-resolution regions efficiently selected through spatially stratified sampling and aggregated using attention-based scoring. GLASS can be integrated into vision models to leverage both global and local information in images of any size. Vision Transformer, ResNet, and ConvNeXt models are used as backbones, and experiments show that GLASS outperforms standard transfer learning by achieving higher predictive performance within feasible computational constraints.

### [6] [FCMBench: A Comprehensive Financial Credit Multimodal Benchmark for Real-world Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00150)
*Yehui Yang,Dalu Yang,Wenshuo Zhou,Fangxin Shang,Yifan Liu,Jie Ren,Haojun Fei,Qing Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FCMBench-V1.0 is a financial credit multimodal benchmark addressing domain-specific needs, privacy compliance, and robustness, evaluating 23 vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a domain-specific benchmark for financial credit applications motivated the creation of FCMBench-V1.0 to ensure practical utility and privacy compliance.

Method: The benchmark was built using a closed synthesis-capture pipeline, covering 18 core certificate types with 4,043 images and 8,446 QA samples, evaluated across Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness dimensions.

Result: Gemini 3 Pro (64.61 F1 score) and Qwen3-VL-235B (57.27 F1 score) performed best among commercial and open-source models, while Qfin-VL-Instruct achieved the top overall score (64.92).

Conclusion: FCMBench-V1.0 effectively discriminates model performance and highlights robustness challenges, even for top-performing models under real-world artifacts.

Abstract: As multimodal AI becomes widely used for credit risk assessment and document review, a domain-specific benchmark is urgently needed that (1) reflects documents and workflows specific to financial credit applications, (2) includes credit-specific understanding and real-world robustness, and (3) preserves privacy compliance without sacrificing practical utility. Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models. Extensive experiments were conducted on 23 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) from 14 top AI companies and research institutes. Among them, Gemini 3 Pro achieves the best F1(\%) score as a commercial model (64.61), Qwen3-VL-235B achieves the best score as an open-source baseline (57.27), and our financial credit-specific model, Qfin-VL-Instruct, achieves the top overall score (64.92). Robustness evaluations show that even top-performing models suffer noticeable performance drops under acquisition artifacts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaceFocalDesc, a system generating and recognizing multi-attribute natural language descriptions for face regions, using a fine-tuned vision-language model called Focal-RegionFace, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underexplored problem of multi-attribute facial analysis for selected regions to enhance understanding and control.

Method: Constructing a new dataset with region-level annotations and proposing Focal-RegionFace, a fine-tuned vision-language model refining focus on facial features through progressive fine-tuning.

Result: Focal-RegionFace outperforms benchmarks in traditional and new metrics, proving effectiveness in fine-grained analysis.

Conclusion: The system excels in fine-grained multi-attribute facial analysis, offering interpretable results for age, AUs, and emotions.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an underexplored problem in facial analysis: generating and recognizing multi-attribute natural language descriptions, containing facial action units (AUs), emotional states, and age estimation, for arbitrarily selected face regions (termed FaceFocalDesc). We argue that the system's ability to focus on individual facial areas leads to better understanding and control. To achieve this capability, we construct a new multi-attribute description dataset for arbitrarily selected face regions, providing rich region-level annotations and natural language descriptions. Further, we propose a fine-tuned vision-language model based on Qwen2.5-VL, called Focal-RegionFace for facial state analysis, which incrementally refines its focus on localized facial features through multiple progressively fine-tuning stages, resulting in interpretable age estimation, FAU and emotion detection. Experimental results show that Focal-RegionFace achieves the best performance on the new benchmark in terms of traditional and widely used metrics, as well as new proposed metrics. This fully verifies its effectiveness and versatility in fine-grained multi-attribute face region-focal analysis scenarios.

### [8] [MorphAny3D: Unleashing the Power of Structured Latent in 3D Morphing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00204)
*Xiaokun Sun,Zeyu Cai,Hao Tang,Ying Tai,Jian Yang,Zhenyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphAny3D is a training-free framework leveraging SLAT representations for high-quality 3D morphing, introducing MCA and TFSA for structural coherence and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in generating semantically consistent and temporally smooth 3D morphing sequences, especially across categories.

Method: Uses Structured Latent (SLAT) representations with Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA) for structural coherence and Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA) for temporal consistency, plus orientation correction.

Result: Generates state-of-the-art morphing sequences, even for cross-category cases, and supports advanced applications like decoupled morphing and 3D style transfer.

Conclusion: MorphAny3D offers a robust, generalized solution for 3D morphing, leveraging SLAT-based generative models effectively.

Abstract: 3D morphing remains challenging due to the difficulty of generating semantically consistent and temporally smooth deformations, especially across categories. We present MorphAny3D, a training-free framework that leverages Structured Latent (SLAT) representations for high-quality 3D morphing. Our key insight is that intelligently blending source and target SLAT features within the attention mechanisms of 3D generators naturally produces plausible morphing sequences. To this end, we introduce Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA), which fuses source and target information for structural coherence, and Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA), which enhances temporal consistency by incorporating features from preceding frames. An orientation correction strategy further mitigates the pose ambiguity within the morphing steps. Extensive experiments show that our method generates state-of-the-art morphing sequences, even for challenging cross-category cases. MorphAny3D further supports advanced applications such as decoupled morphing and 3D style transfer, and can be generalized to other SLAT-based generative models.

### [9] [CropNeRF: A Neural Radiance Field-Based Framework for Crop Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00207)
*Md Ahmed Al Muzaddid,William J. Beksi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D instance segmentation framework for accurate crop counting in outdoor fields, addressing occlusion and clustering challenges using multi-view 2D images and NeRF-based synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate crop counting is essential for agricultural management but is challenging due to occlusions and clustering in field environments.

Method: Utilizes multi-view 2D images and NeRF for 3D instance segmentation, incorporating visibility and mask consistency scores to improve accuracy.

Result: Demonstrated high accuracy on diverse crops (cotton, apples, pears) without crop-specific tuning, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework offers robust, accurate crop counting and contributes a cotton plant dataset for future research.

Abstract: Rigorous crop counting is crucial for effective agricultural management and informed intervention strategies. However, in outdoor field environments, partial occlusions combined with inherent ambiguity in distinguishing clustered crops from individual viewpoints poses an immense challenge for image-based segmentation methods. To address these problems, we introduce a novel crop counting framework designed for exact enumeration via 3D instance segmentation. Our approach utilizes 2D images captured from multiple viewpoints and associates independent instance masks for neural radiance field (NeRF) view synthesis. We introduce crop visibility and mask consistency scores, which are incorporated alongside 3D information from a NeRF model. This results in an effective segmentation of crop instances in 3D and highly-accurate crop counts. Furthermore, our method eliminates the dependence on crop-specific parameter tuning. We validate our framework on three agricultural datasets consisting of cotton bolls, apples, and pears, and demonstrate consistent counting performance despite major variations in crop color, shape, and size. A comparative analysis against the state of the art highlights superior performance on crop counting tasks. Lastly, we contribute a cotton plant dataset to advance further research on this topic.

### [10] [IntraStyler: Exemplar-based Style Synthesis for Cross-modality Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00212)
*Han Liu,Yubo Fan,Hao Li,Dewei Hu,Daniel Moyer,Zhoubing Xu,Benoit M. Dawant,Ipek Oguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IntraStyler, an exemplar-based method for synthesizing diverse intra-domain styles without prior knowledge, improving domain adaptation by addressing intra-domain variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior domain adaptation methods focus on domain shift but neglect intra-domain variability. IntraStyler aims to diversify synthetic target domain data styles without requiring pre-specified variations.

Method: IntraStyler uses exemplar images to guide style synthesis, ensuring output styles match exemplar styles. A style encoder extracts style-only features via contrastive learning.

Result: Evaluated on CrossMoDA 2023, IntraStyler effectively synthesizes controllable styles and enhances downstream segmentation performance.

Conclusion: IntraStyler successfully captures diverse intra-domain styles, improving domain adaptation without relying on prior knowledge.

Abstract: Image-level domain alignment is the de facto approach for unsupervised domain adaptation, where unpaired image translation is used to minimize the domain gap. Prior studies mainly focus on the domain shift between the source and target domains, whereas the intra-domain variability remains under-explored. To address the latter, an effective strategy is to diversify the styles of the synthetic target domain data during image translation. However, previous methods typically require intra-domain variations to be pre-specified for style synthesis, which may be impractical. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based style synthesis method named IntraStyler, which can capture diverse intra-domain styles without any prior knowledge. Specifically, IntraStyler uses an exemplar image to guide the style synthesis such that the output style matches the exemplar style. To extract the style-only features, we introduce a style encoder to learn styles discriminatively based on contrastive learning. We evaluate the proposed method on the largest public dataset for cross-modality domain adaptation, CrossMoDA 2023. Our experiments show the efficacy of our method in controllable style synthesis and the benefits of diverse synthetic data for downstream segmentation.

*Omar Sharif,Eftekhar Hossain,Patrick Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL improves reasoning chains in MLLMs by integrating visual information, addressing bottlenecks in visual perception tasks, yielding performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often lack visual information integration in reasoning, limiting their ability to solve visually demanding tasks like puzzles.

Method: Reward-driven RL with six reward functions targeting reasoning aspects, using GRPO to incentivize structured reasoning and visual information use.

Result: Achieves 5.56% improvement over the base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B), with consistent gains in diverse settings.

Conclusion: RL effectively enhances visual reasoning in MLLMs, proving its potential for improving multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for eliciting reasoning chains before generating final answers. However, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generate reasoning that lacks integration of visual information. This limits their ability to solve problems that demand accurate visual perception, such as visual puzzles. We show that visual perception is the key bottleneck in such tasks: converting images into textual descriptions significantly improves performance, yielding gains of 26.7% for Claude 3.5 and 23.6% for Claude 3.7.
  To address this, we investigate reward-driven RL as a mechanism to unlock long visual reasoning in open-source MLLMs without requiring costly supervision. We design and evaluate six reward functions targeting different reasoning aspects, including image understanding, thinking steps, and answer accuracy. Using group relative policy optimization (GRPO), our approach explicitly incentivizes longer, structured reasoning and mitigates bypassing of visual information. Experiments on Qwen-2.5-VL-7B achieve 5.56% improvements over the base model, with consistent gains across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

### [12] [LooC: Effective Low-Dimensional Codebook for Compositional Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00222)
*Jie Li,Kwan-Yee K. Wong,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LooC introduces a low-dimensional, compositional approach to vector quantization (VQ), expanding solution space and enhancing performance with a compact codebook.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing diversity and complexity of data demand high-capacity yet compact VQ methods, which LooC addresses.

Method: LooC reframes codevector-feature relationships, uses compositional units, and incorporates extrapolation-by-interpolation for smoother features.

Result: LooC outperforms existing VQ methods with a smaller codebook, achieving state-of-the-art performance across tasks.

Conclusion: LooC resolves the trade-off between capacity and compactness in VQ, offering a versatile plug-and-play solution.

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a prevalent and fundamental technique that discretizes continuous feature vectors by approximating them using a codebook. As the diversity and complexity of data and models continue to increase, there is an urgent need for high-capacity, yet more compact VQ methods. This paper aims to reconcile this conflict by presenting a new approach called LooC, which utilizes an effective Low-dimensional codebook for Compositional vector quantization. Firstly, LooC introduces a parameter-efficient codebook by reframing the relationship between codevectors and feature vectors, significantly expanding its solution space. Instead of individually matching codevectors with feature vectors, LooC treats them as lower-dimensional compositional units within feature vectors and combines them, resulting in a more compact codebook with improved performance. Secondly, LooC incorporates a parameter-free extrapolation-by-interpolation mechanism to enhance and smooth features during the VQ process, which allows for better preservation of details and fidelity in feature approximation. The design of LooC leads to full codebook usage, effectively utilizing the compact codebook while avoiding the problem of collapse. Thirdly, LooC can serve as a plug-and-play module for existing methods for different downstream tasks based on VQ. Finally, extensive evaluations on different tasks, datasets, and architectures demonstrate that LooC outperforms existing VQ methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a significantly smaller codebook.

*Aobo Li,Jinjian Wu,Yongxu Liu,Leida Li,Weisheng Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynDR-IQA improves BIQA generalization by reshaping synthetic data distribution through diverse content upsampling and redundant cluster downsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limited generalization ability of BIQA models trained on synthetic datasets due to clustered feature patterns.

Method: Introduces SynDR-IQA with two strategies: distribution-aware diverse content upsampling and density-aware redundant cluster downsampling.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across synthetic-to-authentic, synthetic-to-algorithmic, and synthetic-to-synthetic settings.

Conclusion: SynDR-IQA enhances BIQA generalization by optimizing synthetic data distribution.

Abstract: Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) has advanced significantly through deep learning, but the scarcity of large-scale labeled datasets remains a challenge. While synthetic data offers a promising solution, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often show limited generalization ability. In this work, we make a key observation that representations learned from synthetic datasets often exhibit a discrete and clustered pattern that hinders regression performance: features of high-quality images cluster around reference images, while those of low-quality images cluster based on distortion types. Our analysis reveals that this issue stems from the distribution of synthetic data rather than model architecture. Consequently, we introduce a novel framework SynDR-IQA, which reshapes synthetic data distribution to enhance BIQA generalization. Based on theoretical derivations of sample diversity and redundancy's impact on generalization error, SynDR-IQA employs two strategies: distribution-aware diverse content upsampling, which enhances visual diversity while preserving content distribution, and density-aware redundant cluster downsampling, which balances samples by reducing the density of densely clustered areas. Extensive experiments across three cross-dataset settings (synthetic-to-authentic, synthetic-to-algorithmic, and synthetic-to-synthetic) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/Li-aobo/SynDR-IQA.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cross-modal data augmentation framework using CycleGAN and YOLOv8 to address IR data scarcity in PCB defect detection, improving detection performance with synthetic IR samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the scarcity of infrared data for PCB defect detection by leveraging visible-light data through cross-modal augmentation.

Method: CycleGAN translates unpaired visible-light PCB images to synthetic IR samples, fused with real IR data to train YOLOv8 detector.

Result: Enhanced feature learning and detection performance, nearing benchmarks of fully supervised training.

Conclusion: Pseudo-IR synthesis via CycleGAN proves effective for industrial inspection under low-data conditions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of infrared (IR) data scarcity in Printed Circuit Board (PCB) defect detection by proposing a cross-modal data augmentation framework integrating CycleGAN and YOLOv8. Unlike conventional methods relying on paired supervision, we leverage CycleGAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, mapping abundant visible-light PCB images into the infrared domain. This generative process synthesizes high-fidelity pseudo-IR samples that preserve the structural semantics of defects while accurately simulating thermal distribution patterns. Subsequently, we construct a heterogeneous training strategy that fuses generated pseudo-IR data with limited real IR samples to train a lightweight YOLOv8 detector. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively enhances feature learning under low-data conditions. The augmented detector significantly outperforms models trained on limited real data alone and approaches the performance benchmarks of fully supervised training, proving the efficacy of pseudo-IR synthesis as a robust augmentation strategy for industrial inspection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pest management methods are costly, labor-intensive, and environmentally harmful. The study aims to provide a scalable, efficient, and eco-friendly alternative for small farmers.

Method: The framework includes a Pest Detection Module (lightweight CNN with meta-learning) and a Pesticide Recommendation Module (incorporating environmental factors). A diverse pest image dataset was used for training.

Result: The proposed CNN achieves high accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models with lower complexity. The system reduces reliance on chemical pesticides, promoting sustainability.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time pest management in precision agriculture, offering a scalable solution for small farmers using low-resource devices.

Abstract: Effective pest management is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity, especially for crops such as sugarcane and wheat that are highly vulnerable to pest infestations. Traditional pest management methods depend heavily on manual field inspections and the use of chemical pesticides. These approaches are often costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and can have a negative impact on the environment. To overcome these challenges, this study presents a lightweight framework for pest detection and pesticide recommendation, designed for low-resource devices such as smartphones and drones, making it suitable for use by small and marginal farmers.
  The proposed framework includes two main components. The first is a Pest Detection Module that uses a compact, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with prototypical meta-learning to accurately identify pests even when only a few training samples are available. The second is a Pesticide Recommendation Module that incorporates environmental factors like crop type and growth stage to suggest safe and eco-friendly pesticide recommendations. To train and evaluate our framework, a comprehensive pest image dataset was developed by combining multiple publicly available datasets. The final dataset contains samples with different viewing angles, pest sizes, and background conditions to ensure strong generalization.
  Experimental results show that the proposed lightweight CNN achieves high accuracy, comparable to state-of-the-art models, while significantly reducing computational complexity. The Decision Support System additionally improves pest management by reducing dependence on traditional chemical pesticides and encouraging sustainable practices, demonstrating its potential for real-time applications in precision agriculture.

Motivation: Addressing computational cost challenges in training 3D-CT foundation models while balancing efficiency and representation capability.

Method: Automated creation of organ-volume and finding-sentence pairs using segmentation and LLM-based report processing. Combines self-supervised pre-training (VideoMAE) with contrastive learning (volume-text pairs).

Result: Higher F1 scores in 83% of organs (vs CT-CLIP) and 64% (vs Merlin); superior AUROC in 83% of finding categories (vs Merlin). Comparable performance in radiology report generation.

Conclusion: The organ-separated learning framework is effective for practical 3D-CT foundation model implementation, showing high generalization in clinical settings.

Abstract: While foundation models in radiology are expected to be applied to various clinical tasks, computational cost constraints remain a major challenge when training on 3D-CT volumetric data. In this study, we propose TotalFM, a radiological foundation model that efficiently learns the correspondence between 3D-CT images and linguistic expressions based on the concept of organ separation, utilizing a large-scale dataset of 140,000 series. By automating the creation of organ volume and finding-sentence pairs through segmentation techniques and Large Language Model (LLM)-based radiology report processing, and by combining self-supervised pre-training via VideoMAE with contrastive learning using volume-text pairs, we aimed to balance computational efficiency and representation capability. In zero-shot organ-wise lesion classification tasks, the proposed model achieved higher F1 scores in 83% (5/6) of organs compared to CT-CLIP and 64% (9/14) of organs compared to Merlin. These results suggest that the proposed model exhibits high generalization performance in a clinical evaluation setting using actual radiology report sentences. Furthermore, in zero-shot finding-wise lesion classification tasks, our model achieved a higher AUROC in 83% (25/30) of finding categories compared to Merlin. We also confirmed performance comparable to existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in radiology report generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that the organ-separated learning framework can serve as a realistic and effective design guideline for the practical implementation of 3D-CT foundation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the semantic gap in scientific imagery and sparse textual descriptions to advance multimodal learning in scientific discovery.

Method: Create a dataset from 2.5M papers, recaption images using Qwen-VL, and validate with SciBERT and CLIP metrics.

Result: Improved alignment (18.21% higher CLIP scores) and reduced semantic ambiguity via AI-enhanced captions.

Conclusion: S1-MMAlign is a foundational resource for AI-driven scientific reasoning and cross-modal understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has revolutionized general domain tasks, yet its application in scientific discovery is hindered by the profound semantic gap between complex scientific imagery and sparse textual descriptions. We present S1-MMAlign, a large-scale, multi-disciplinary multimodal dataset comprising over 15.5 million high-quality image-text pairs derived from 2.5 million open-access scientific papers. Spanning disciplines from physics and biology to engineering, the dataset captures diverse visual modalities including experimental setups, heatmaps, and microscopic imagery. To address the pervasive issue of weak alignment in raw scientific captions, we introduce an AI-ready semantic enhancement pipeline that utilizes the Qwen-VL multimodal large model series to recaption images by synthesizing context from paper abstracts and citation contexts. Technical validation demonstrates that this enhancement significantly improves data quality: SciBERT-based pseudo-perplexity metrics show reduced semantic ambiguity, while CLIP scores indicate an 18.21% improvement in image-text alignment. S1-MMAlign provides a foundational resource for advancing scientific reasoning and cross-modal understanding in the era of AI for Science. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScienceOne-AI/S1-MMAlign.

*Yi Sun,Xinhao Zhong,Hongyan Li,Yimin Zhou,Junhao Li,Bin Chen,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method (ActErase) for efficient concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is proposed, achieving SOTA performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety, copyright, and ethical concerns in diffusion models by erasing sensitive concepts without data-intensive fine-tuning.

Method: Identifies activation difference regions via prompt-pair analysis, extracts target activations, and dynamically replaces input activations during forward passes.

Result: Achieves SOTA erasure performance across nudity, artistic style, and object removal tasks while preserving generative capability and robustness against attacks.

Conclusion: ActErase establishes a plug-and-play paradigm for lightweight and effective concept manipulation in diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation capabilities, yet they raise significant concerns regarding safety, copyright, and ethical implications. Existing concept erasure methods address these risks by removing sensitive concepts from pre-trained models, but most of them rely on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning, which poses a critical limitation. To overcome these challenges, inspired by the observation that the model's activations are predominantly composed of generic concepts, with only a minimal component can represent the target concept, we propose a novel training-free method (ActErase) for efficient concept erasure. Specifically, the proposed method operates by identifying activation difference regions via prompt-pair analysis, extracting target activations and dynamically replacing input activations during forward passes. Comprehensive evaluations across three critical erasure tasks (nudity, artistic style, and object removal) demonstrates that our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) erasure performance, while effectively preserving the model's overall generative capability. Our approach also exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, establishing a new plug-and-play paradigm for lightweight yet effective concept manipulation in diffusion models.

*Chaodong Tong,Qi Zhang,Chen Li,Lei Jiang,Yanbing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaithSCAN detects hallucinations in VQA by leveraging internal VLM signals, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies and limitations in current hallucination detection methods.

Method: FaithSCAN fuses token-level decoding uncertainty, visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features.

Result: FaithSCAN outperforms existing methods in effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: Hallucinations stem from systematic internal state variations; FaithSCAN offers new insights.

Abstract: Faithfulness hallucinations in VQA occur when vision-language models produce fluent yet visually ungrounded answers, severely undermining their reliability in safety-critical applications. Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding. Different internal signals provide complementary diagnostic cues, and hallucination patterns vary across VLM architectures, offering new insights into the underlying causes of multimodal hallucinations.

### [20] [Disentangling Hardness from Noise: An Uncertainty-Driven Model-Agnostic Framework for Long-Tailed Remote Sensing Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00278)
*Chi Ding,Junxiao Xue,Xinyi Yin,Shi Chen,Yunyun Shi,Yiduo Wang,Fengjian Xue,Xuecheng Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of disentangling hard tail samples from noisy ones in long-tailed remote sensing data by introducing DUAL, an uncertainty-aware framework that uses epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to guide reweighting and adaptive label smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed distributions in remote sensing lead to imbalanced object occurrences, but existing methods fail to differentiate hard tail samples from noisy ones, causing overfitting.

Method: DUAL dynamically disentangles prediction uncertainty into epistemic (for sample scarcity) and aleatoric (for data ambiguity) uncertainty, guiding reweighting and adaptive label smoothing.

Result: DUAL outperforms baselines like TGN and SADE across multiple datasets and backbones, validated through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: DUAL effectively addresses the long-tailed challenge by leveraging uncertainty types, offering improved generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Long-Tailed distributions are pervasive in remote sensing due to the inherently imbalanced occurrence of grounded objects. However, a critical challenge remains largely overlooked, i.e., disentangling hard tail data samples from noisy ambiguous ones. Conventional methods often indiscriminately emphasize all low-confidence samples, leading to overfitting on noisy data. To bridge this gap, building upon Evidential Deep Learning, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware framework termed DUAL, which dynamically disentangles prediction uncertainty into Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) and Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU). Specifically, we introduce EU as an indicator of sample scarcity to guide a reweighting strategy for hard-to-learn tail samples, while leveraging AU to quantify data ambiguity, employing an adaptive label smoothing mechanism to suppress the impact of noise. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets across various backbones demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework, surpassing strong baselines such as TGN and SADE. Ablation studies provide further insights into the crucial choices of our design.

*Jun-Jee Chao,Volkan Isler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV-GS is a framework for dynamic object reconstruction from sparse observations, using a skeleton-driven deformation field and achieving superior performance with fewer frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic reconstruction from sparse viewpoints and time steps is highly ill-posed in real-world scenarios, necessitating an efficient solution.

Method: SV-GS leverages a skeleton graph and static reconstruction to estimate motion, combining coarse joint pose estimation with fine-grained deformations.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by up to 34% in PSNR on synthetic datasets and matches dense video methods on real-world datasets with fewer frames.

Conclusion: SV-GS is effective for sparse observations and can utilize generative priors, enhancing practicality.

Abstract: Reconstructing a dynamic target moving over a large area is challenging. Standard approaches for dynamic object reconstruction require dense coverage in both the viewing space and the temporal dimension, typically relying on multi-view videos captured at each time step. However, such setups are only possible in constrained environments. In real-world scenarios, observations are often sparse over time and captured sparsely from diverse viewpoints (e.g., from security cameras), making dynamic reconstruction highly ill-posed. We present SV-GS, a framework that simultaneously estimates a deformation model and the object's motion over time under sparse observations. To initialize SV-GS, we leverage a rough skeleton graph and an initial static reconstruction as inputs to guide motion estimation. (Later, we show that this input requirement can be relaxed.) Our method optimizes a skeleton-driven deformation field composed of a coarse skeleton joint pose estimator and a module for fine-grained deformations. By making only the joint pose estimator time-dependent, our model enables smooth motion interpolation while preserving learned geometric details. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches under sparse observations by up to 34% in PSNR, and achieves comparable performance to dense monocular video methods on real-world datasets despite using significantly fewer frames. Moreover, we demonstrate that the input initial static reconstruction can be replaced by a diffusion-based generative prior, making our method more practical for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: Addressing the limited availability of dermatologists and rising skin disease cases by providing diagnostic support tools.

Method: Pretrained on public skin disease datasets, refined model architecture, optimized preprocessing, and applied data augmentation.

Result: Achieved 87.71% accuracy across eight skin lesion classes on ISIC2019.

Conclusion: The model shows promise as a diagnostic aid for clinicians and self-assessment tool for patients.

Abstract: As dermatological conditions become increasingly common and the availability of dermatologists remains limited, there is a growing need for intelligent tools to support both patients and clinicians in the timely and accurate diagnosis of skin diseases. In this project, we developed a deep learning based model for the classification and diagnosis of skin conditions. By leveraging pretraining on publicly available skin disease image datasets, our model effectively extracted visual features and accurately classified various dermatological cases. Throughout the project, we refined the model architecture, optimized data preprocessing workflows, and applied targeted data augmentation techniques to improve overall performance. The final model, based on the Swin Transformer, achieved a prediction accuracy of 87.71 percent across eight skin lesion classes on the ISIC2019 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeColor is a sketch-based video colorization model that uses multiple references with explicit region assignment, improving color fidelity and consistency over single-reference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing colorization models rely on a single reference (e.g., the first frame), ignoring other potential references like character sheets or background images. TimeColor aims to leverage diverse references for better results.

Method: TimeColor encodes references as latent frames concatenated temporally, processed concurrently in diffusion steps. It uses spatiotemporal correspondence-masked attention and modality-disjoint RoPE indexing to prevent shortcuts and palette leakage.

Result: Experiments on SAKUGA-42M show TimeColor outperforms baselines in color fidelity, identity consistency, and temporal stability under single- and multi-reference protocols.

Conclusion: TimeColor demonstrates the advantages of using heterogeneous, variable-count references with explicit region assignment for video colorization.

Abstract: Most colorization models condition only on a single reference, typically the first frame of the scene. However, this approach ignores other sources of conditional data, such as character sheets, background images, or arbitrary colorized frames. We propose TimeColor, a sketch-based video colorization model that supports heterogeneous, variable-count references with the use of explicit per-reference region assignment. TimeColor encodes references as additional latent frames which are concatenated temporally, permitting them to be processed concurrently in each diffusion step while keeping the model's parameter count fixed. TimeColor also uses spatiotemporal correspondence-masked attention to enforce subject-reference binding in addition to modality-disjoint RoPE indexing. These mechanisms mitigate shortcutting and cross-identity palette leakage. Experiments on SAKUGA-42M under both single- and multi-reference protocols show that TimeColor improves color fidelity, identity consistency, and temporal stability over prior baselines.

Result: Achieves 87.05% Rank-1 and 77.65% mAP on Market-1501 with 32.41M parameters and 4.601 GFLOPs.

Conclusion: VisNet offers a practical solution for real-time ReID in resource-constrained environments like surveillance and mobile applications.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) is an extremely important area in both surveillance and mobile applications, requiring strong accuracy with minimal computational cost. State-of-the-art methods give good accuracy but with high computational budgets. To remedy this, this paper proposes VisNet, a computationally efficient and effective re-identification model suitable for real-world scenarios. It is the culmination of conceptual contributions, including feature fusion at multiple scales with automatic attention on each, semantic clustering with anatomical body partitioning, a dynamic weight averaging technique to balance classification semantic regularization, and the use of loss function FIDI for improved metric learning tasks. The multiple scales fuse ResNet50's stages 1 through 4 without the use of parallel paths, with semantic clustering introducing spatial constraints through the use of rule-based pseudo-labeling. VisNet achieves 87.05% Rank-1 and 77.65% mAP on the Market-1501 dataset, having 32.41M parameters and 4.601 GFLOPs, hence, proposing a practical approach for real-time deployment in surveillance and mobile applications where computational resources are limited.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniVaT, a framework addressing modality discrepancies and domain gaps in visual-tactile learning (VTL) through unified embedding and hierarchical representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual-tactile learning (VTL) faces challenges like modality discrepancies and domain gaps due to inconsistent data collection. This paper aims to solve these issues for better generalization.

Method: OmniVaT uses a multimodal fractional Fourier adapter (MFFA) to unify embeddings and a discrete tree generation (DTG) module for diverse representations.

Result: OmniVaT achieves superior cross-domain generalization on the SDG-VTL task.

Conclusion: OmniVaT effectively mitigates modality gaps and enhances adaptability, proving successful in VTL tasks.

Abstract: Visual-tactile learning (VTL) enables embodied agents to perceive the physical world by integrating visual (VIS) and tactile (TAC) sensors. However, VTL still suffers from modality discrepancies between VIS and TAC images, as well as domain gaps caused by non-standardized tactile sensors and inconsistent data collection procedures. We formulate these challenges as a new task, termed single domain generalization for multimodal VTL (SDG-VTL). In this paper, we propose an OmniVaT framework that, for the first time, successfully addresses this task. On the one hand, OmniVaT integrates a multimodal fractional Fourier adapter (MFFA) to map VIS and TAC embeddings into a unified embedding-frequency space, thereby effectively mitigating the modality gap without multi-domain training data or careful cross-modal fusion strategies. On the other hand, it also incorporates a discrete tree generation (DTG) module that obtains diverse and reliable multimodal fractional representations through a hierarchical tree structure, thereby enhancing its adaptivity to fluctuating domain shifts in unseen domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior cross-domain generalization performance of OmniVaT on the SDG-VTL task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need a deeper understanding of their surroundings for intuitive interaction with humans in domestic environments, moving beyond fixed-class semantic segmentation.

Method: The approach leverages teacher embeddings from Alpha-CLIP to train the efficient student model DVEFormer, learning fine-grained pixel-wise embeddings instead of fixed classes.

Result: Achieves competitive performance (26.3 FPS for full model, 77.0 FPS for smaller variant) and enables text-based querying and 3D mapping applications.

Conclusion: DVEFormer replaces traditional segmentation methods, offering flexibility with natural-language querying and seamless 3D mapping integration for robotics.

Abstract: In domestic environments, robots require a comprehensive understanding of their surroundings to interact effectively and intuitively with untrained humans. In this paper, we propose DVEFormer - an efficient RGB-D Transformer-based approach that predicts dense text-aligned visual embeddings (DVE) via knowledge distillation. Instead of directly performing classical semantic segmentation with fixed predefined classes, our method uses teacher embeddings from Alpha-CLIP to guide our efficient student model DVEFormer in learning fine-grained pixel-wise embeddings. While this approach still enables classical semantic segmentation, e.g., via linear probing, it further enables flexible text-based querying and other applications, such as creating comprehensive 3D maps. Evaluations on common indoor datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance while meeting real-time requirements, operating at 26.3 FPS for the full model and 77.0 FPS for a smaller variant on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. Additionally, we show qualitative results that highlight the effectiveness and possible use cases in real-world applications. Overall, our method serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional segmentation approaches while enabling flexible natural-language querying and seamless integration into 3D mapping pipelines for mobile robotics.

TL;DR: A lightweight two-stage framework for joint 3D geometry and color inpainting of damaged objects, using mask prediction and diffusion-based reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for digital restoration of cultural heritage artifacts, requiring accurate inpainting of both geometry and color.

Method: The pipeline involves two stages: (1) a 2D CNN predicts damage masks on RGB slices, aggregated into a volumetric mask, and (2) a diffusion-based 3D U-Net performs mask-conditioned inpainting on voxel grids using a composite objective for occupancy and color reconstruction.

Result: The method outperforms symmetry-based baselines, producing more complete geometry and coherent color reconstructions at a fixed 32³ resolution.

Conclusion: Explicit mask conditioning is practical for guiding volumetric diffusion models in joint 3D geometry and color inpainting.

Abstract: We present a lightweight two-stage framework for joint geometry and color inpainting of damaged 3D objects, motivated by the digital restoration of cultural heritage artifacts. The pipeline separates damage localization from reconstruction. In the first stage, a 2D convolutional network predicts damage masks on RGB slices extracted from a voxelized object, and these predictions are aggregated into a volumetric mask. In the second stage, a diffusion-based 3D U-Net performs mask-conditioned inpainting directly on voxel grids, reconstructing geometry and color while preserving observed regions. The model jointly predicts occupancy and color using a composite objective that combines occupancy reconstruction with masked color reconstruction and perceptual regularization. We evaluate the approach on a curated set of textured artifacts with synthetically generated damage using standard geometric and color metrics. Compared to symmetry-based baselines, our method produces more complete geometry and more coherent color reconstructions at a fixed 32^3 resolution. Overall, the results indicate that explicit mask conditioning is a practical way to guide volumetric diffusion models for joint 3D geometry and color inpainting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HAR methods focus on large-scale motions, ignoring subtle hand articulations crucial for fine-grained recognition.

Method: Proposes a probabilistic dual-stream framework with calibration-free preprocessing, Noisy-OR fusion, and intra- to cross-modal ensemble.

Result: Consistent improvements and robustness across benchmarks, including noisy and heterogeneous conditions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates multi-modal data and handles uncertainty, enhancing HAR performance.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition (HAR) has achieved remarkable progress with graph-based architectures. However, most existing methods remain body-centric, focusing on large-scale motions while neglecting subtle hand articulations that are crucial for fine-grained recognition. This work presents a probabilistic dual-stream framework that unifies reliability modeling and multi-modal integration, generalizing expertized learning under uncertainty across both intra-skeleton and cross-modal domains. The framework comprises three key components: (1) a calibration-free preprocessing pipeline that removes canonical-space transformations and learns directly from native coordinates; (2) a probabilistic Noisy-OR fusion that stabilizes reliability-aware dual-stream learning without requiring explicit confidence supervision; and (3) an intra- to cross-modal ensemble that couples four skeleton modalities (Joint, Bone, Joint Motion, and Bone Motion) to RGB representations, bridging structural and visual motion cues in a unified cross-modal formulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks (NTU RGB+D~60/120, PKU-MMD, N-UCLA) and a newly defined hand-centric benchmark exhibit consistent improvements and robustness under noisy and heterogeneous conditions.

Motivation: Current roadside litter monitoring is labor-intensive and lacks spatial coverage. Existing datasets don't address dashcam footage's unique challenges (small, sparse litter in cluttered backgrounds).

Method: Introduces RoLID-11K, a dataset for dashcam-based litter detection. Benchmarks various detectors, including transformers and YOLO models, analyzing their performance on small-object detection.

Result: CO-DETR achieves top localization accuracy, but real-time models struggle due to coarse feature hierarchies.

Conclusion: RoLID-11K sets a benchmark for small-object detection in driving scenes, aiding scalable, low-cost litter monitoring systems. The dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: Roadside litter poses environmental, safety and economic challenges, yet current monitoring relies on labour-intensive surveys and public reporting, providing limited spatial coverage. Existing vision datasets for litter detection focus on street-level still images, aerial scenes or aquatic environments, and do not reflect the unique characteristics of dashcam footage, where litter appears extremely small, sparse and embedded in cluttered road-verge backgrounds. We introduce RoLID-11K, the first large-scale dataset for roadside litter detection from dashcams, comprising over 11k annotated images spanning diverse UK driving conditions and exhibiting pronounced long-tail and small-object distributions. We benchmark a broad spectrum of modern detectors, from accuracy-oriented transformer architectures to real-time YOLO models, and analyse their strengths and limitations on this challenging task. Our results show that while CO-DETR and related transformers achieve the best localisation accuracy, real-time models remain constrained by coarse feature hierarchies. RoLID-11K establishes a challenging benchmark for extreme small-object detection in dynamic driving scenes and aims to support the development of scalable, low-cost systems for roadside-litter monitoring.

Result: Improved estimation accuracy by 1.3% and reduced misclassification between adjacent tasks by 1.9% in desktop PC assembly tests.

Conclusion: The proposed Anomaly Quadruplet-Net effectively enhances assembly progress estimation, demonstrating superior performance over prior methods.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of AI technologies has accelerated the development of smart factories. In particular, the automatic monitoring of product assembly progress is crucial for improving operational efficiency, minimizing the cost of discarded parts, and maximizing factory productivity. However, in cases where assembly tasks are performed manually over multiple days, implementing smart factory systems remains a challenge. Previous work has proposed Anomaly Triplet-Net, which estimates assembly progress by applying deep metric learning to the visual features of products. Nevertheless, when visual changes between consecutive tasks are subtle, misclassification often occurs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust system for estimating assembly progress, even in cases of occlusion or minimal visual change, using a small-scale dataset. Our method leverages a Quadruplet Loss-based learning approach for anomaly images and introduces a custom data loader that strategically selects training samples to enhance estimation accuracy. We evaluated our approach using a image datasets: captured during desktop PC assembly. The proposed Anomaly Quadruplet-Net outperformed existing methods on the dataset. Specifically, it improved the estimation accuracy by 1.3% and reduced misclassification between adjacent tasks by 1.9% in the desktop PC dataset and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Ahmad Rezaei,Mohsen Gholami,Saeed Ranjbar Alvar,Kevin Cannons,Mohammad Asiful Hossain,Zhou Weimin,Shunbo Zhou,Yong Zhang,Mohammad Akbari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPPO is a method for fine-tuning vision-language models using reinforcement learning, focusing on improving perception and reasoning without extra models or data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to disentangle perception tokens from reasoning tokens in multimodal reasoning, often requiring additional resources or indiscriminate rewards.

Method: CPPO detects perception tokens via entropy shifts under perturbed inputs and uses a Contrastive Perception Loss to enforce consistency or sensitivity based on input perturbations.

Result: CPPO outperforms prior methods, improving efficiency and scalability without needing extra models.

Conclusion: CPPO effectively enhances multimodal reasoning by optimizing perception and reasoning jointly, offering a more efficient solution.

Abstract: We introduce CPPO, a Contrastive Perception Policy Optimization method for finetuning vision-language models (VLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced reasoning in language models, extending it to multimodal reasoning requires improving both the perception and reasoning aspects. Prior works tackle this challenge mainly with explicit perception rewards, but disentangling perception tokens from reasoning tokens is difficult, requiring extra LLMs, ground-truth data, forced separation of perception from reasoning by policy model, or applying rewards indiscriminately to all output tokens. CPPO addresses this problem by detecting perception tokens via entropy shifts in the model outputs under perturbed input images. CPPO then extends the RL objective function with a Contrastive Perception Loss (CPL) that enforces consistency under information-preserving perturbations and sensitivity under information-removing ones. Experiments show that CPPO surpasses previous perception-rewarding methods, while avoiding extra models, making training more efficient and scalable.

*Miaowei Wang,Jakub Zadrożny,Oisin Mac Aodha,Amir Vaxman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionPhysics is a differentiable framework that infers physical parameters from natural language prompts for 3D scenes, eliminating the need for ground-truth data. It uses a multimodal language model and motion distillation loss to achieve realistic simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating 3D objects and materials accurately requires expert knowledge and manual parameter tuning. MotionPhysics aims to automate this process using natural language prompts.

Method: The framework employs a multimodal large language model for material parameter estimation and introduces a learnable motion distillation loss to guide simulations using pretrained video diffusion models.

Result: MotionPhysics was tested on over thirty scenarios with diverse materials and objects, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in producing realistic simulations.

Conclusion: MotionPhysics successfully automates the simulation of realistic dynamic behaviors guided by natural language, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurately simulating existing 3D objects and a wide variety of materials often demands expert knowledge and time-consuming physical parameter tuning to achieve the desired dynamic behavior. We introduce MotionPhysics, an end-to-end differentiable framework that infers plausible physical parameters from a user-provided natural language prompt for a chosen 3D scene of interest, removing the need for guidance from ground-truth trajectories or annotated videos. Our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model to estimate material parameter values, which are constrained to lie within plausible ranges. We further propose a learnable motion distillation loss that extracts robust motion priors from pretrained video diffusion models while minimizing appearance and geometry inductive biases to guide the simulation. We evaluate MotionPhysics across more than thirty scenarios, including real-world, human-designed, and AI-generated 3D objects, spanning a wide range of materials such as elastic solids, metals, foams, sand, and both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. We demonstrate that MotionPhysics produces visually realistic dynamic simulations guided by natural language, surpassing the state of the art while automatically determining physically plausible parameters.

*Wenrui Li,Hongtao Chen,Yao Xiao,Wangmeng Zuo,Jiantao Zhou,Yonghong Tian,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SEUD scenario for video restoration, addressing smoothly evolving degradations, and proposes ORCANet with CIED and FPG modules for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video restoration methods ignore temporal continuity in degradation processes. The SEUD scenario captures evolving degradations, requiring a novel approach.

Method: ORCANet includes a CIED module for haze intensity estimation and a FPG module with static and dynamic prompts for degradation adaptation. Label-aware supervision enhances discriminability.

Result: ORCANet outperforms baselines in restoration quality, temporal consistency, and robustness, demonstrating effectiveness in the SEUD scenario.

Conclusion: The proposed ORCANet effectively addresses the SEUD scenario, combining temporal coherence and adaptive degradation handling for superior video restoration.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to recover clean images from diverse unknown degradations using a single model. But extending this task to videos faces unique challenges. Existing approaches primarily focus on frame-wise degradation variation, overlooking the temporal continuity that naturally exists in real-world degradation processes. In practice, degradation types and intensities evolve smoothly over time, and multiple degradations may coexist or transition gradually. In this paper, we introduce the Smoothly Evolving Unknown Degradations (SEUD) scenario, where both the active degradation set and degradation intensity change continuously over time. To support this scenario, we design a flexible synthesis pipeline that generates temporally coherent videos with single, compound, and evolving degradations. To address the challenges in the SEUD scenario, we propose an all-in-One Recurrent Conditional and Adaptive prompting Network (ORCANet). First, a Coarse Intensity Estimation Dehazing (CIED) module estimates haze intensity using physical priors and provides coarse dehazed features as initialization. Second, a Flow Prompt Generation (FPG) module extracts degradation features. FPG generates both static prompts that capture segment-level degradation types and dynamic prompts that adapt to frame-level intensity variations. Furthermore, a label-aware supervision mechanism improves the discriminability of static prompt representations under different degradations. Extensive experiments show that ORCANet achieves superior restoration quality, temporal consistency, and robustness over image and video-based baselines.

*Ruiqiang Zhang,Hengyi Wang,Chang Liu,Guanjie Wang,Zehua Ma,Weiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeText improves text rendering in large-scale diffusion models by localizing writing regions and injecting glyph priors without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with precise text rendering, especially for complex layouts and scripts like Chinese, requiring costly solutions.

Method: FreeText uses token-wise spatial attribution for localization and Spectral-Modulated Glyph Injection (SGMI) to enhance glyph structure.

Result: Experiments show improved text readability across benchmarks while maintaining semantic alignment and aesthetics.

Conclusion: FreeText offers a training-free, flexible solution for better text rendering in diffusion models.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at open-domain synthesis but still struggle with precise text rendering, especially for multi-line layouts, dense typography, and long-tailed scripts such as Chinese. Prior solutions typically require costly retraining or rigid external layout constraints, which can degrade aesthetics and limit flexibility. We propose \textbf{FreeText}, a training-free, plug-and-play framework that improves text rendering by exploiting intrinsic mechanisms of \emph{Diffusion Transformer (DiT)} models. \textbf{FreeText} decomposes the problem into \emph{where to write} and \emph{what to write}. For \emph{where to write}, we localize writing regions by reading token-wise spatial attribution from endogenous image-to-text attention, using sink-like tokens as stable spatial anchors and topology-aware refinement to produce high-confidence masks. For \emph{what to write}, we introduce Spectral-Modulated Glyph Injection (SGMI), which injects a noise-aligned glyph prior with frequency-domain band-pass modulation to strengthen glyph structure and suppress semantic leakage (rendering the concept instead of the word). Extensive experiments on Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, and SD3 variants across longText-Benchmark, CVTG, and our CLT-Bench show consistent gains in text readability while largely preserving semantic alignment and aesthetic quality, with modest inference overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VNS-SAM enhances SAM's segmentation in visually non-salient scenarios using Mask-Edge Token Interactive decoder and Non-Salient Feature Mining, achieving superior zero-shot performance with minimal added cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with visually non-salient scenarios due to low contrast between foreground and background, leading to inaccurate segmentation.

Method: Proposes VNS-SAM with Mask-Edge Token Interactive decoder and Non-Salient Feature Mining to exploit low-level features for better non-salient perception.

Result: VNS-SAM shows superior performance in zero-shot settings, with feasibility confirmed by quick optimization (under 4 hours).

Conclusion: VNS-SAM improves SAM's capability in non-salient scenarios efficiently, supported by the VNS-SEG dataset, and holds potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its remarkable zero-shot segmentation capabilities, has garnered significant attention in the community. Nevertheless, its performance is challenged when dealing with what we refer to as visually non-salient scenarios, where there is low contrast between the foreground and background. In these cases, existing methods often cannot capture accurate contours and fail to produce promising segmentation results. In this paper, we propose Visually Non-Salient SAM (VNS-SAM), aiming to enhance SAM's perception of visually non-salient scenarios while preserving its original zero-shot generalizability. We achieve this by effectively exploiting SAM's low-level features through two designs: Mask-Edge Token Interactive decoder and Non-Salient Feature Mining module. These designs help the SAM decoder gain a deeper understanding of non-salient characteristics with only marginal parameter increments and computational requirements. The additional parameters of VNS-SAM can be optimized within 4 hours, demonstrating its feasibility and practicality. In terms of data, we established VNS-SEG, a unified dataset for various VNS scenarios, with more than 35K images, in contrast to previous single-task adaptations. It is designed to make the model learn more robust VNS features and comprehensively benchmark the model's segmentation performance and generalizability on VNS scenarios. Extensive experiments across various VNS segmentation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VNS-SAM, particularly under zero-shot settings, highlighting its potential for broad real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous drag-style image editing methods face issues like miss tracking and ambiguous tracking, leading to poor editability. DynaDrag aims to solve these problems with a new framework.

Method: DynaDrag uses a predict-and-move framework with iterative Motion Prediction and Motion Supervision steps, dynamically adjusting handle points for better performance.

Result: Experiments on face and human datasets demonstrate DynaDrag's superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: DynaDrag effectively addresses limitations of previous approaches, offering improved performance in drag-style image editing.

Abstract: To achieve pixel-level image manipulation, drag-style image editing which edits images using points or trajectories as conditions is attracting widespread attention. Most previous methods follow move-and-track framework, in which miss tracking and ambiguous tracking are unavoidable challenging issues. Other methods under different frameworks suffer from various problems like the huge gap between source image and target edited image as well as unreasonable intermediate point which can lead to low editability. To avoid these problems, we propose DynaDrag, the first dragging method under predict-and-move framework. In DynaDrag, Motion Prediction and Motion Supervision are performed iteratively. In each iteration, Motion Prediction first predicts where the handle points should move, and then Motion Supervision drags them accordingly. We also propose to dynamically adjust the valid handle points to further improve the performance. Experiments on face and human datasets showcase the superiority over previous works.

TL;DR: SlingBAG Pro improves 3D photoacoustic imaging reconstruction for irregular arrays, offering faster processing with fewer transducers while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms for irregular transducer arrays in 3D photoacoustic imaging.

Method: Introduces SlingBAG Pro, extending SlingBAG's point cloud iteration concept to arbitrary array geometries, using hierarchical optimization with zero-gradient filtering and increased temporal sampling rates.

Result: Achieves up to 2.2-fold speed improvement in reconstruction and reduces transducer requirements. Validated via simulation and in vivo experiments.

Conclusion: SlingBAG Pro is an efficient, high-quality solution for 3D photoacoustic imaging with irregular arrays.

Abstract: High-quality three-dimensional (3D) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is gaining increasing attention in clinical applications. To address the challenges of limited space and high costs, irregular geometric transducer arrays that conform to specific imaging regions are promising for achieving high-quality 3D PAI with fewer transducers. However, traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms struggle with irregular array configurations, suffering from high computational complexity, substantial memory requirements, and lengthy reconstruction times. In this work, we introduce SlingBAG Pro, an advanced reconstruction algorithm based on the point cloud iteration concept of the Sliding ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) method, while extending its compatibility to arbitrary array geometries. SlingBAG Pro maintains high reconstruction quality, reduces the number of required transducers, and employs a hierarchical optimization strategy that combines zero-gradient filtering with progressively increased temporal sampling rates during iteration. This strategy rapidly removes redundant spatial point clouds, accelerates convergence, and significantly shortens overall reconstruction time. Compared to the original SlingBAG algorithm, SlingBAG Pro achieves up to a 2.2-fold speed improvement in point cloud-based 3D PA reconstruction under irregular array geometries. The proposed method is validated through both simulation and in vivo mouse experiments, and the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG_Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of multimodal generative AI systems, synthetic images are becoming indistinguishable from real ones, posing risks of misinformation and manipulated media.

Method: A dataset of 96,000 real and synthetic images was created using MS COCO and five AI generators (Stable Diffusion 3, Stable Diffusion 2.1, SDXL, DALL-E 3, MidJourney v6). Two tasks were proposed: classifying images as real or generated, and identifying the source model.

Result: The dataset is publicly available and supports research in detecting AI-generated images.

Conclusion: MS COCOAI provides a valuable resource for developing tools to combat the spread of misleading synthetic media.

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI systems like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and MidJourney have fundamentally changed how synthetic images are created. These tools drive innovation but also enable the spread of misleading content, false information, and manipulated media. As generated images become harder to distinguish from photographs, detecting them has become an urgent priority. To combat this challenge, We release MS COCOAI, a novel dataset for AI generated image detection consisting of 96000 real and synthetic datapoints, built using the MS COCO dataset. To generate synthetic images, we use five generators: Stable Diffusion 3, Stable Diffusion 2.1, SDXL, DALL-E 3, and MidJourney v6. Based on the dataset, we propose two tasks: (1) classifying images as real or generated, and (2) identifying which model produced a given synthetic image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AEGIS is a new benchmark for Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) to evaluate their world knowledge across diverse tasks like understanding, generation, and editing. It uses a deterministic checklist-based evaluation (DCE) for reliable scoring. Findings show UMMs struggle with world knowledge and complex reasoning, but simple reasoning modules can help.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for UMMs are limited to single-task evaluations, lacking comprehensive assessment of world knowledge application across tasks.

Method: Proposed AEGIS, a multi-task benchmark with 1,050 questions across 21 topics and 6 reasoning types, and introduced DCE for reliable evaluation.

Result: Most UMMs show significant world knowledge deficits, especially in complex reasoning, but plug-in reasoning modules can improve performance.

Conclusion: World-knowledge-based reasoning is crucial for advancing UMMs, and AEGIS with DCE provides a robust framework for future research.

Abstract: The capability of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) to apply world knowledge across diverse tasks remains a critical, unresolved challenge. Existing benchmarks fall short, offering only siloed, single-task evaluations with limited diagnostic power. To bridge this gap, we propose AEGIS (\emph{i.e.}, \textbf{A}ssessing \textbf{E}diting, \textbf{G}eneration, \textbf{I}nterpretation-Understanding for \textbf{S}uper-intelligence), a comprehensive multi-task benchmark covering visual understanding, generation, editing, and interleaved generation. AEGIS comprises 1,050 challenging, manually-annotated questions spanning 21 topics (including STEM, humanities, daily life, etc.) and 6 reasoning types. To concretely evaluate the performance of UMMs in world knowledge scope without ambiguous metrics, we further propose Deterministic Checklist-based Evaluation (DCE), a protocol that replaces ambiguous prompt-based scoring with atomic ``Y/N'' judgments, to enhance evaluation reliability. Our extensive experiments reveal that most UMMs exhibit severe world knowledge deficits and that performance degrades significantly with complex reasoning. Additionally, simple plug-in reasoning modules can partially mitigate these vulnerabilities, highlighting a promising direction for future research. These results highlight the importance of world-knowledge-based reasoning as a critical frontier for UMMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mismatch in semantic granularity between textual queries and visual content in zero-shot video moment retrieval (ZVMR) hinders accurate retrieval despite using high-quality pre-trained knowledge.

Method: GranAlign introduces granularity-based query rewriting to diversify semantic granularities and query-aware caption generation to embed query intent into video content, resolving semantic mismatches without training.

Result: The framework outperforms previous methods, achieving a 3.23% mAP@avg improvement on QVHighlights and setting new benchmarks on Charades-STA and ActivityNet-Captions.

Conclusion: GranAlign effectively balances coarse and fine semantic representations, demonstrating superior performance in ZVMR tasks by aligning multi-level queries with query-aware captions.

Abstract: Zero-shot video moment retrieval (ZVMR) is the task of localizing a temporal moment within an untrimmed video using a natural language query without relying on task-specific training data. The primary challenge in this setting lies in the mismatch in semantic granularity between textual queries and visual content. Previous studies in ZVMR have attempted to achieve alignment by leveraging high-quality pre-trained knowledge that represents video and language in a joint space. However, these approaches failed to balance the semantic granularity between the pre-trained knowledge provided by each modality for a given scene. As a result, despite the high quality of each modality's representations, the mismatch in granularity led to inaccurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, called Granularity-Aware Alignment (GranAlign), that bridges this gap between coarse and fine semantic representations. Our approach introduces two complementary techniques: granularity-based query rewriting to generate varied semantic granularities, and query-aware caption generation to embed query intent into video content. By pairing multi-level queries with both query-agnostic and query-aware captions, we effectively resolve semantic mismatches. As a result, our method sets a new state-of-the-art across all three major benchmarks (QVHighlights, Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions), with a notable 3.23% mAP@avg improvement on the challenging QVHighlights dataset.

Motivation: Address safety concerns in T2M methods by overcoming flaws in discrete codebook replacement and dataset unsuitability.

Method: Proposes SafeMo with MMU, a two-stage unlearning strategy in continuous space, and introduces SafeMoVAE-29K dataset.

Result: Achieves 2.5x and 14.4x higher forget-set FID on benchmarks compared to SOTA, maintaining benign performance.

Conclusion: SafeMo efficiently generates safe human motions with better safety-utility trade-offs and natural transitions.

Abstract: Text-to-motion (T2M) generation with diffusion backbones achieves strong realism and alignment. Safety concerns in T2M methods have been raised in recent years; existing methods replace discrete VQ-VAE codebook entries to steer the model away from unsafe behaviors. However, discrete codebook replacement-based methods have two critical flaws: firstly, replacing codebook entries which are reused by benign prompts leads to drifts on everyday tasks, degrading the model's benign performance; secondly, discrete token-based methods introduce quantization and smoothness loss, resulting in artifacts and jerky transitions. Moreover, existing text-to-motion datasets naturally contain unsafe intents and corresponding motions, making them unsuitable for safety-driven machine learning. To address these challenges, we propose SafeMo, a trustworthy motion generative framework integrating Minimal Motion Unlearning (MMU), a two-stage machine unlearning strategy, enabling safe human motion generation in continuous space, preserving continuous kinematics without codebook loss and delivering strong safety-utility trade-offs compared to current baselines. Additionally, we present the first safe text-to-motion dataset SafeMoVAE-29K integrating rewritten safe text prompts and continuous refined motion for trustworthy human motion unlearning. Built upon DiP, SafeMo efficiently generates safe human motions with natural transitions. Experiments demonstrate effective unlearning performance of SafeMo by showing strengthened forgetting on unsafe prompts, reaching 2.5x and 14.4x higher forget-set FID on HumanML3D and Motion-X respectively, compared to the previous SOTA human motion unlearning method LCR, with benign performance on safe prompts being better or comparable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-IR multimodal perception is crucial but suffers from optimization bias due to asymmetric modality characteristics, hindering effective fusion.

Method: Proposes Modality Dominance Index (MDI) to quantify bias and develops MDACL with Hierarchical Cross-modal Guidance (HCG) and Adversarial Equilibrium Regularization (AER) for balanced optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on three RGB-IR benchmarks show MDACL mitigates bias and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MDACL effectively addresses optimization bias in RGB-IR fusion, improving performance through balanced cross-modal learning.

Abstract: RGB-Infrared (RGB-IR) multimodal perception is fundamental to embodied multimedia systems operating in complex physical environments. Although recent cross-modal fusion methods have advanced RGB-IR detection, the optimization dynamics caused by asymmetric modality characteristics remain underexplored. In practice, disparities in information density and feature quality introduce persistent optimization bias, leading training to overemphasize a dominant modality and hindering effective fusion. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose the Modality Dominance Index (MDI), which measures modality dominance by jointly modeling feature entropy and gradient contribution. Based on MDI, we develop a Modality Dominance-Aware Cross-modal Learning (MDACL) framework that regulates cross-modal optimization. MDACL incorporates Hierarchical Cross-modal Guidance (HCG) to enhance feature alignment and Adversarial Equilibrium Regularization (AER) to balance optimization dynamics during fusion. Extensive experiments on three RGB-IR benchmarks demonstrate that MDACL effectively mitigates optimization bias and achieves SOTA performance.

Result: Improves DINO baseline by 1.2% AP on AI-TOD dataset, validated across three datasets.

Conclusion: TOLF effectively enhances tiny object detection robustness and performance despite noisy supervision.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in generic object detection, a persistent performance gap remains for tiny objects compared to normal-scale objects. We demonstrate that tiny objects are highly sensitive to annotation noise, where optimizing strict localization objectives risks noise overfitting. To address this, we propose Tiny Object Localization with Flows (TOLF), a noise-robust localization framework leveraging normalizing flows for flexible error modeling and uncertainty-guided optimization. Our method captures complex, non-Gaussian prediction distributions through flow-based error modeling, enabling robust learning under noisy supervision. An uncertainty-aware gradient modulation mechanism further suppresses learning from high-uncertainty, noise-prone samples, mitigating overfitting while stabilizing training. Extensive experiments across three datasets validate our approach's effectiveness. Especially, TOLF boosts the DINO baseline by 1.2% AP on the AI-TOD dataset.

Firstly, we introduce a unified pipeline for end-to-end real-time human pose estimation and motion analysis using RGB video input from multiple cameras which can be applied to the field of rehabilitation training. The pipeline can help to monitor and correct patients'actions, thus aiding them in regaining muscle strength and motor functions. Secondly, we propose a fast tracking method for medical rehabilitation scenarios with multiple-person interference, which requires less than 1ms for tracking for a single frame. Additionally, we modify SmoothNet for real-time posture estimation, effectively reducing pose estimation errors and restoring the patient's true motion state, making it visually smoother. Finally, we use Unity platform for real-time monitoring and evaluation of patients' motion during rehabilitation, and to display the muscle stress conditions to assist patients with their rehabilitation training.

*Shuren Gabriel Yu,Sikang Ren,Yongji Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperPriv-EPN is a hypergraph-based LUPI framework that leverages privileged post-surgery text data during training to improve preoperative prognosis of Ependymoma using MRI data alone during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in the lack of semantic insights in preoperative MRI compared to post-operative surgical reports. Existing methods fail to utilize privileged text data when it's unavailable during inference.

Method: HyperPriv-EPN uses a Severed Graph Strategy with a shared encoder for Teacher (post-surgery data) and Student (pre-operation data) graphs. Dual-stream distillation helps the Student hallucinate semantic structures from visual features.

Result: Validated on 311 patients, HyperPriv-EPN achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and survival stratification.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transfers expert knowledge to preoperative settings, utilizing historical post-operative data without requiring text during inference.

Abstract: Preoperative prognosis of Ependymoma is critical for treatment planning but challenging due to the lack of semantic insights in MRI compared to post-operative surgical reports. Existing multimodal methods fail to leverage this privileged text data when it is unavailable during inference. To bridge this gap, we propose HyperPriv-EPN, a hypergraph-based Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework. We introduce a Severed Graph Strategy, utilizing a shared encoder to process both a Teacher graph (enriched with privileged post-surgery information) and a Student graph (restricted to pre-operation data). Through dual-stream distillation, the Student learns to hallucinate semantic community structures from visual features alone. Validated on a multi-center cohort of 311 patients, HyperPriv-EPN achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and survival stratification. This effectively transfers expert knowledge to the preoperative setting, unlocking the value of historical post-operative data to guide the diagnosis of new patients without requiring text at inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models using pre-trained architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, ViT) were developed for sprout detection, weight loss estimation, and shelf-life prediction in stored potatoes, achieving high accuracy. Broader class divisions yielded better results, demonstrating practical benefits for inventory management and reducing food waste.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in monitoring potato quality during storage, such as sprout detection, weight loss estimation, and shelf-life prediction, using non-invasive and scalable image-based deep learning solutions.

Method: Images and weight data were collected over 200 days under controlled conditions. Specialized models were designed using ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and ViT architectures: a binary classifier for sprout detection and a multi-class predictor for weight loss and shelf-life estimation.

Result: DenseNet achieved 98.03% accuracy in sprout detection. Shelf-life prediction models performed best with 2-5 classes (89.83% accuracy), declining for finer divisions due to subtle visual differences. Practical benefits include improved inventory management and reduced food waste.

Conclusion: Image-based models offer a cost-effective, non-destructive method for potato quality assessment. Future research should focus on generalized models for diverse varieties and conditions to enhance scalability.

Abstract: Image-based deep learning provides a non-invasive, scalable solution for monitoring potato quality during storage, addressing key challenges such as sprout detection, weight loss estimation, and shelf-life prediction. In this study, images and corresponding weight data were collected over a 200-day period under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Leveraging powerful pre-trained architectures of ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT), we designed two specialized models: (1) a high-precision binary classifier for sprout detection, and (2) an advanced multi-class predictor to estimate weight loss and forecast remaining shelf-life with remarkable accuracy. DenseNet achieved exceptional performance, with 98.03% accuracy in sprout detection. Shelf-life prediction models performed best with coarse class divisions (2-5 classes), achieving over 89.83% accuracy, while accuracy declined for finer divisions (6-8 classes) due to subtle visual differences and limited data per class. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating image-based models into automated sorting and inventory systems, enabling early identification of sprouted potatoes and dynamic categorization based on storage stage. Practical implications include improved inventory management, differential pricing strategies, and reduced food waste across supply chains. While predicting exact shelf-life intervals remains challenging, focusing on broader class divisions ensures robust performance. Future research should aim to develop generalized models trained on diverse potato varieties and storage conditions to enhance adaptability and scalability. Overall, this approach offers a cost-effective, non-destructive method for quality assessment, supporting efficiency and sustainability in potato storage and distribution.

*Zhaiyu Chen,Yuanyuan Wang,Yilei Shi,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based framework converts noisy TomoSAR point clouds into high-resolution building height maps, addressing issues like noise and data voids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate building height estimation is crucial for urban applications, and TomoSAR offers a viable alternative to optical methods despite its challenges.

Method: The framework uses a dual-topology network with point and grid branches to denoise and inpaint TomoSAR data.

Result: Experiments in Munich and Berlin confirm the method's effectiveness, and integrating optical imagery further improves results.

Conclusion: The approach is the first to enable large-scale urban height mapping directly from TomoSAR point clouds, with potential enhancements from optical data.

Abstract: Reliable building height estimation is essential for various urban applications. Spaceborne SAR tomography (TomoSAR) provides weather-independent, side-looking observations that capture facade-level structure, offering a promising alternative to conventional optical methods. However, TomoSAR point clouds often suffer from noise, anisotropic point distributions, and data voids on incoherent surfaces, all of which hinder accurate height reconstruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a learning-based framework for converting raw TomoSAR points into high-resolution building height maps. Our dual-topology network alternates between a point branch that models irregular scatterer features and a grid branch that enforces spatial consistency. By jointly processing these representations, the network denoises the input points and inpaints missing regions to produce continuous height estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of concept for large-scale urban height mapping directly from TomoSAR point clouds. Extensive experiments on data from Munich and Berlin validate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that our framework can be extended to incorporate optical satellite imagery, further enhancing reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRoPS, a training-free framework, mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs by selectively removing key text tokens and integrating multiple hallucinated models, improving CHAIR scores by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address hallucinations effectively due to narrow assumptions and declining performance toward the end of generation.

Method: Proposes a hallucinated model that removes key text tokens and introduces Generalized Contrastive Decoding to integrate diverse hallucination sources.

Result: CRoPS improves CHAIR scores by 20% and outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods across six benchmarks and three LVLM families.

Conclusion: CRoPS offers a robust, training-free solution to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs, enhancing reliability.

Abstract: Despite the rapid success of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), a persistent challenge is their tendency to generate hallucinated content, undermining reliability in real-world use. Existing training-free methods address hallucinations but face two limitations: (i) they rely on narrow assumptions about hallucination sources, and (ii) their effectiveness declines toward the end of generation, where hallucinations are most likely to occur. A common strategy is to build hallucinated models by completely or partially removing visual tokens and contrasting them with the original model. Yet, this alone proves insufficient, since visual information still propagates into generated text. Building on this insight, we propose a novel hallucinated model that captures hallucination effects by selectively removing key text tokens. We further introduce Generalized Contrastive Decoding, which integrates multiple hallucinated models to represent diverse hallucination sources. Together, these ideas form CRoPS, a training-free hallucination mitigation framework that improves CHAIR scores by 20% and achieves consistent gains across six benchmarks and three LVLM families, outperforming state-of-the-art training-free methods.

*Melonie de Almeida,Daniela Ivanova,Tong Shi,John H. Williamson,Paul Henderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for single-image-conditioned video generation using 3D Gaussian scene representation achieves state-of-the-art results in video quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack robust user controllability (e.g., camera path modification) and struggle with temporal consistency and geometric integrity.

Method: Constructs a 3D Gaussian scene representation and samples plausible object motion in a single forward pass.

Result: Achieves superior video quality and inference efficiency on datasets like KITTI, Waymo, RealEstate10K, and DL3DV-10K.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables fast, camera-guided video generation without iterative denoising.

Abstract: Humans excel at forecasting the future dynamics of a scene given just a single image. Video generation models that can mimic this ability are an essential component for intelligent systems. Recent approaches have improved temporal coherence and 3D consistency in single-image-conditioned video generation. However, these methods often lack robust user controllability, such as modifying the camera path, limiting their applicability in real-world applications. Most existing camera-controlled image-to-video models struggle with accurately modeling camera motion, maintaining temporal consistency, and preserving geometric integrity. Leveraging explicit intermediate 3D representations offers a promising solution by enabling coherent video generation aligned with a given camera trajectory. Although these methods often use 3D point clouds to render scenes and introduce object motion in a later stage, this two-step process still falls short in achieving full temporal consistency, despite allowing precise control over camera movement. We propose a novel framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian scene representation and samples plausible object motion, given a single image in a single forward pass. This enables fast, camera-guided video generation without the need for iterative denoising to inject object motion into render frames. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, Waymo, RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art video quality and inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores spatial downsampling in isotropic networks for image demosaicing, showing it improves efficiency and performance compared to traditional designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of isotropic networks in mobile digital imaging by exploring spatial downsampling.

Method: Designed fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using DeepMAD-inspired techniques, testing them on demosaicing tasks.

Result: Downsampling improved empirical performance; JD3Net (downsampled variant) performed well on demosaicing and JDD tasks.

Conclusion: Spatial downsampling enhances isotropic networks' efficiency and effectiveness for mobile demosaicing applications.

Abstract: In digital imaging, image demosaicing is a crucial first step which recovers the RGB information from a color filter array (CFA). Oftentimes, deep learning is utilized to perform image demosaicing. Given that most modern digital imaging applications occur on mobile platforms, applying deep learning to demosaicing requires lightweight and efficient networks. Isotropic networks, also known as residual-in-residual networks, have been often employed for image demosaicing and joint-demosaicing-and-denoising (JDD). Most demosaicing isotropic networks avoid spatial downsampling entirely, and thus are often prohibitively expensive computationally for mobile applications. Contrary to previous isotropic network designs, this paper claims that spatial downsampling to a signficant degree can improve the efficiency and performance of isotropic networks. To validate this claim, we design simple fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using a mathematical architecture design technique adapted from DeepMAD, and find that downsampling improves empirical performance. Additionally, empirical testing of the downsampled variant, JD3Net, of our fully convolutional networks reveals strong empirical performance on a variety of image demosaicing and JDD tasks.

TL;DR: RGS-SLAM is a robust Gaussian-splatting SLAM framework that replaces residual-driven densification with a training-free correspondence-to-Gaussian initialization for faster convergence and higher fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the stability and efficiency of early mapping in SLAM systems by avoiding the progressive addition of Gaussians and leveraging dense multi-view correspondences.

Method: Uses a one-shot triangulation of dense correspondences from DINOv3 descriptors, refined through a confidence-aware classifier, to create a Gaussian seed prior to optimization.

Result: Achieves 20% faster convergence and higher rendering fidelity, with competitive or superior accuracy on TUM RGB-D and Replica datasets, sustaining real-time performance at up to 925 FPS.

Conclusion: RGS-SLAM enhances SLAM performance by stabilizing early mapping and accelerating optimization while maintaining compatibility with existing pipelines.

Abstract: We introduce RGS-SLAM, a robust Gaussian-splatting SLAM framework that replaces the residual-driven densification stage of GS-SLAM with a training-free correspondence-to-Gaussian initialization. Instead of progressively adding Gaussians as residuals reveal missing geometry, RGS-SLAM performs a one-shot triangulation of dense multi-view correspondences derived from DINOv3 descriptors refined through a confidence-aware inlier classifier, generating a well-distributed and structure-aware Gaussian seed prior to optimization. This initialization stabilizes early mapping and accelerates convergence by roughly 20\%, yielding higher rendering fidelity in texture-rich and cluttered scenes while remaining fully compatible with existing GS-SLAM pipelines. Evaluated on the TUM RGB-D and Replica datasets, RGS-SLAM achieves competitive or superior localization and reconstruction accuracy compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian and point-based SLAM systems, sustaining real-time mapping performance at up to 925 FPS.

### [55] [Detecting Performance Degradation under Data Shift in Pathology Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00716)
*Hao Guan,Li Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates performance degradation detection in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under data shift, introducing DomainSAT for input-level shift analysis and a confidence-based indicator for output-level monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs in medical imaging face performance degradation post-deployment due to data shifts, posing risks to clinical reliability. Current methods lack labeled data adaptability.

Method: Developed DomainSAT for input-level shift detection and introduced a label-free confidence-based indicator for output-level degradation monitoring.

Result: Input shift detection identifies distribution changes but not always performance drops. Confidence-based indicators closely track degradation, complementing input methods.

Conclusion: Combining input and output monitoring provides a reliable framework for detecting VLM performance degradation under data shift, enhancing clinical reliability.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have demonstrated strong potential in medical image analysis and disease diagnosis. However, after deployment, their performance may deteriorate when the input data distribution shifts from that observed during development. Detecting such performance degradation is essential for clinical reliability, yet remains challenging for large pre-trained VLMs operating without labeled data. In this study, we investigate performance degradation detection under data shift in a state-of-the-art pathology VLM. We examine both input-level data shift and output-level prediction behavior to understand their respective roles in monitoring model reliability. To facilitate systematic analysis of input data shift, we develop DomainSAT, a lightweight toolbox with a graphical interface that integrates representative shift detection algorithms and enables intuitive exploration of data shift. Our analysis shows that while input data shift detection is effective at identifying distributional changes and providing early diagnostic signals, it does not always correspond to actual performance degradation. Motivated by this observation, we further study output-based monitoring and introduce a label-free, confidence-based degradation indicator that directly captures changes in model prediction confidence. We find that this indicator exhibits a close relationship with performance degradation and serves as an effective complement to input shift detection. Experiments on a large-scale pathology dataset for tumor classification demonstrate that combining input data shift detection and output confidence-based indicators enables more reliable detection and interpretation of performance degradation in VLMs under data shift. These findings provide a practical and complementary framework for monitoring the reliability of foundation models in digital pathology.

*Johannes C. Bauer,Paul Geng,Stephan Trattnig,Petr Dokládal,Rüdiger Daub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-level feature fusion (MLFF) approach for continual learning in volatile manufacturing scenarios, improving efficiency and reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are limited in volatile manufacturing settings like remanufacturing due to frequent changes in products and defects, requiring efficient and adaptable solutions.

Method: The MLFF approach utilizes representations from different depths of a pretrained network to enable quick adaptation with fewer trainable parameters.

Result: MLFF matches end-to-end training performance while using fewer parameters, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and improves generalization to new product types or defects.

Conclusion: MLFF is an effective solution for continual learning in dynamic manufacturing environments, balancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks show great potential for automating various visual quality inspection tasks in manufacturing. However, their applicability is limited in more volatile scenarios, such as remanufacturing, where the inspected products and defect patterns often change. In such settings, deployed models require frequent adaptation to novel conditions, effectively posing a continual learning problem. To enable quick adaptation, the necessary training processes must be computationally efficient while still avoiding effects like catastrophic forgetting. This work presents a multi-level feature fusion (MLFF) approach that aims to improve both aspects simultaneously by utilizing representations from different depths of a pretrained network. We show that our approach is able to match the performance of end-to-end training for different quality inspection problems while using significantly less trainable parameters. Furthermore, it reduces catastrophic forgetting and improves generalization robustness to new product types or defects.

*Janez Perš,Jon Muhovič,Andrej Košir,Boštjan Murovec*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated workflow using multimodal LLMs grades handwritten STEM exams accurately, with minimal manual intervention, leveraging structured prompting and reference solutions for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual grading of handwritten STEM exams is slow and hard to scale. Automating this process can save time while preserving open-ended reasoning assessment.

Method: Uses multimodal LLMs in a multi-stage pipeline: format check, ensemble grading, supervisor aggregation, and deterministic validation. Requires a handwritten reference solution and grading rules.

Result: Achieves ≈8-point mean absolute difference to lecturer grades, low bias, and ≈17% manual-review trigger rate. Structured prompting and reference grounding are crucial for accuracy.

Conclusion: The workflow effectively automates grading of handwritten exams, balancing accuracy and scalability while minimizing manual effort.

Abstract: Handwritten STEM exams capture open-ended reasoning and diagrams, but manual grading is slow and difficult to scale. We present an end-to-end workflow for grading scanned handwritten engineering quizzes with multimodal large language models (LLMs) that preserves the standard exam process (A4 paper, unconstrained student handwriting). The lecturer provides only a handwritten reference solution (100%) and a short set of grading rules; the reference is converted into a text-only summary that conditions grading without exposing the reference scan. Reliability is achieved through a multi-stage design with a format/presence check to prevent grading blank answers, an ensemble of independent graders, supervisor aggregation, and rigid templates with deterministic validation to produce auditable, machine-parseable reports. We evaluate the frozen pipeline in a clean-room protocol on a held-out real course quiz in Slovenian, including hand-drawn circuit schematics. With state-of-the-art backends (GPT-5.2 and Gemini-3 Pro), the full pipeline achieves $\approx$8-point mean absolute difference to lecturer grades with low bias and an estimated manual-review trigger rate of $\approx$17% at $D_{\max}=40$. Ablations show that trivial prompting and removing the reference solution substantially degrade accuracy and introduce systematic over-grading, confirming that structured prompting and reference grounding are essential.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCo introduces a unified approach to structured shape completion by decoding primitives in a dedicated pathway, improving geometry recovery and consistency compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to rethink the interaction between primitives and points for more effective structured shape completion, avoiding the limitations of prevailing cascade methods.

Method: UniCo uses primitive proxies (learnable queries) and a dedicated pathway to predict primitives with complete geometry, semantics, and inlier membership in a single feed-forward pass. Training couples primitives and points with online target updates.

Result: UniCo outperforms recent baselines, reducing Chamfer distance by up to 50% and improving normal consistency by up to 7% across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper establishes UniCo as an effective solution for structured 3D understanding from incomplete data, offering a unified representation and consistent optimization.

Abstract: Structured shape completion recovers missing geometry as primitives rather than as unstructured points, which enables primitive-based surface reconstruction. Instead of following the prevailing cascade, we rethink how primitives and points should interact, and find it more effective to decode primitives in a dedicated pathway that attends to shared shape features. Following this principle, we present UniCo, which in a single feed-forward pass predicts a set of primitives with complete geometry, semantics, and inlier membership. To drive this unified representation, we introduce primitive proxies, learnable queries that are contextualized to produce assembly-ready outputs. To ensure consistent optimization, our training strategy couples primitives and points with online target updates. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks with four independent assembly solvers, UniCo consistently outperforms recent baselines, lowering Chamfer distance by up to 50% and improving normal consistency by up to 7%. These results establish an attractive recipe for structured 3D understanding from incomplete data. Project page: https://unico-completion.github.io.

Abstract: In this work, we attempted to unleash the potential of self-supervised learning as an auxiliary task that can optimise the primary task of generalised deepfake detection. To explore this, we examined different combinations of the training schemes for these tasks that can be most effective. Our findings reveal that fusing the feature representation from self-supervised auxiliary tasks is a powerful feature representation for the problem at hand. Such a representation can leverage the ultimate potential and bring in a unique representation of both the self-supervised and primary tasks, achieving better performance for the primary task. We experimented on a large set of datasets, which includes DF40, FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, DFD, FaceShifter, UADFV, and our results showed better generalizability on cross-dataset evaluation when compared with current state-of-the-art detectors.

TL;DR: Proposes LNU-Net and IBU-Net for LV segmentation in MRI images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods using dice coefficient and average perpendicular distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate LV segmentation is crucial for cardiac diagnosis, and existing methods can be improved.

Method: LNU-Net uses layer normalization; IBU-Net combines instance and batch normalization. Both include down-sampling and up-sampling paths with affine and elastic transformations for data augmentation.

Result: Outperforms other methods in dice coefficient and average perpendicular distance on a dataset of 805 MRI images.

Conclusion: LNU-Net and IBU-Net are effective for LV segmentation, offering superior performance over existing techniques.

Abstract: Left ventricle (LV) segmentation is critical for clinical quantification and diagnosis of cardiac images. In this work, we propose two novel deep learning architectures called LNU-Net and IBU-Net for left ventricle segmentation from short-axis cine MRI images. LNU-Net is derived from layer normalization (LN) U-Net architecture, while IBU-Net is derived from the instance-batch normalized (IB) U-Net for medical image segmentation. The architectures of LNU-Net and IBU-Net have a down-sampling path for feature extraction and an up-sampling path for precise localization. We use the original U-Net as the basic segmentation approach and compared it with our proposed architectures. Both LNU-Net and IBU-Net have left ventricle segmentation methods: LNU-Net applies layer normalization in each convolutional block, while IBU-Net incorporates instance and batch normalization together in the first convolutional block and passes its result to the next layer. Our method incorporates affine transformations and elastic deformations for image data processing. Our dataset that contains 805 MRI images regarding the left ventricle from 45 patients is used for evaluation. We experimentally evaluate the results of the proposed approaches outperforming the dice coefficient and the average perpendicular distance than other state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: AdaGaR is a new framework for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular videos, addressing frequency adaptivity and temporal continuity with innovative methods like Adaptive Gabor Representation and Cubic Hermite Splines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with capturing high-frequency details and ensuring temporal continuity, leading to motion artifacts and instability.

Method: AdaGaR uses Adaptive Gabor Representation for detail and stability, Cubic Hermite Splines with Temporal Curvature Regularization for smooth motion, and Adaptive Initialization for stable point clouds.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (PSNR 35.49, SSIM 0.9433, LPIPS 0.0723) and excels in interpolation, depth consistency, video editing, and stereo view synthesis.

Conclusion: AdaGaR effectively balances detail capture and motion smoothness, setting a new benchmark for dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos requires simultaneously capturing high-frequency appearance details and temporally continuous motion. Existing methods using single Gaussian primitives are limited by their low-pass filtering nature, while standard Gabor functions introduce energy instability. Moreover, lack of temporal continuity constraints often leads to motion artifacts during interpolation. We propose AdaGaR, a unified framework addressing both frequency adaptivity and temporal continuity in explicit dynamic scene modeling. We introduce Adaptive Gabor Representation, extending Gaussians through learnable frequency weights and adaptive energy compensation to balance detail capture and stability. For temporal continuity, we employ Cubic Hermite Splines with Temporal Curvature Regularization to ensure smooth motion evolution. An Adaptive Initialization mechanism combining depth estimation, point tracking, and foreground masks establishes stable point cloud distributions in early training. Experiments on Tap-Vid DAVIS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (PSNR 35.49, SSIM 0.9433, LPIPS 0.0723) and strong generalization across frame interpolation, depth consistency, video editing, and stereo view synthesis.

TL;DR: RIMRULE is a neuro-symbolic method for adapting LLMs to task-specific tools by injecting compact, interpretable rules distilled from failures, improving accuracy without altering model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific tools due to idiosyncratic APIs or workflows, necessitating effective adaptation.

Method: Rules derived from failure traces are injected into prompts during inference, optimized for generality and conciseness using MDL, and stored in natural and symbolic forms.

Result: Improves accuracy on seen and unseen tools, outperforms prompting methods, complements finetuning, and rules are reusable across LLMs.

Conclusion: RIMRULE enhances LLM tool-use adaptability through symbolic rule injection, offering portable and interpretable improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to use tools reliably in domain-specific settings, where APIs may be idiosyncratic, under-documented, or tailored to private workflows. This highlights the need for effective adaptation to task-specific tools. We propose RIMRULE, a neuro-symbolic approach for LLM adaptation based on dynamic rule injection. Compact, interpretable rules are distilled from failure traces and injected into the prompt during inference to improve task performance. These rules are proposed by the LLM itself and consolidated using a Minimum Description Length (MDL) objective that favors generality and conciseness. Each rule is stored in both natural language and a structured symbolic form, supporting efficient retrieval at inference time. Experiments on tool-use benchmarks show that this approach improves accuracy on both seen and unseen tools without modifying LLM weights. It outperforms prompting-based adaptation methods and complements finetuning. Moreover, rules learned from one LLM can be reused to improve others, including long reasoning LLMs, highlighting the portability of symbolic knowledge across architectures.

Method: Pat-DEVAL employs Chain-of-Legal-Thought (CoLT), a legally-constrained reasoning mechanism, validated by patent experts.

Result: Achieves Pearson correlation of 0.69, outperforming baselines, with 0.73 correlation in Legal-Professional Compliance.

Conclusion: Pat-DEVAL sets a new standard for automated patent drafting, ensuring technical soundness and legal compliance.

Abstract: Patent descriptions must deliver comprehensive technical disclosure while meeting strict legal standards such as enablement and written description requirements. Although large language models have enabled end-to-end automated patent drafting, existing evaluation approaches fail to assess long-form structural coherence and statutory compliance specific to descriptions. We propose Pat-DEVAL, the first multi-dimensional evaluation framework dedicated to patent description bodies. Leveraging the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, Pat-DEVAL introduces Chain-of-Legal-Thought (CoLT), a legally-constrained reasoning mechanism that enforces sequential patent-law-specific analysis. Experiments validated by patent expert on our Pap2Pat-EvalGold dataset demonstrate that Pat-DEVAL achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.69, significantly outperforming baseline metrics and existing LLM evaluators. Notably, the framework exhibits a superior correlation of 0.73 in Legal-Professional Compliance, proving that the explicit injection of statutory constraints is essential for capturing nuanced legal validity. By establishing a new standard for ensuring both technical soundness and legal compliance, Pat-DEVAL provides a robust methodological foundation for the practical deployment of automated patent drafting systems.

### [64] [Understanding Emotion in Discourse: Recognition Insights and Linguistic Patterns for Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00181)
*Cheonkam Jeong,Adeline Nyamathi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper systematically analyzes the IEMOCAP dataset to address gaps in emotion recognition (ERC) and linguistic analysis, finding conversational context crucial, hierarchical representations less impactful with context, and external lexicons unnecessary. It also links emotion to discourse marker positioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to resolve two gaps in ERC: unclear architectural choices and the lack of linguistic analysis connecting recognition to generation, using the IEMOCAP dataset.

Method: Conducts a rigorous ablation study with 10-seed evaluation for recognition and analyzes 5,286 discourse marker occurrences for linguistic patterns.

Result: Key findings include the importance of conversational context (90% gain within recent 10-30 turns), limited benefit of hierarchical representations with context, and no gain from external lexicons. Achieves 82.69% (4-way) and 67.07% (6-way) weighted F1. Linguistic analysis shows significant emotion-marker positioning associations (p < .0001).

Conclusion: Conversational context is critical for ERC, subsuming other architectural benefits. Linguistic analysis reveals emotion-specific marker usage, supporting the need for context, especially for sad utterances.

Abstract: While Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) has achieved high accuracy, two critical gaps remain: a limited understanding of \textit{which} architectural choices actually matter, and a lack of linguistic analysis connecting recognition to generation. We address both gaps through a systematic analysis of the IEMOCAP dataset.
  For recognition, we conduct a rigorous ablation study with 10-seed evaluation and report three key findings. First, conversational context is paramount, with performance saturating rapidly -- 90\% of the total gain achieved within just the most recent 10--30 preceding turns (depending on the label set). Second, hierarchical sentence representations help at utterance-level, but this benefit disappears once conversational context is provided, suggesting that context subsumes intra-utterance structure. Third, external affective lexicons (SenticNet) provide no gain, indicating that pre-trained encoders already capture necessary emotional semantics. With simple architectures using strictly causal context, we achieve 82.69\% (4-way) and 67.07\% (6-way) weighted F1, outperforming prior text-only methods including those using bidirectional context.
  For linguistic analysis, we analyze 5,286 discourse marker occurrences and find a significant association between emotion and marker positioning ($p < .0001$). Notably, "sad" utterances exhibit reduced left-periphery marker usage (21.9\%) compared to other emotions (28--32\%), consistent with theories linking left-periphery markers to active discourse management. This connects to our recognition finding that sadness benefits most from context (+22\%p): lacking explicit pragmatic signals, sad utterances require conversational history for disambiguation.

### [65] [Knowledge Distillation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00202)
*Wang Xing,Wei Song,Siyu Lin,Chen Wu,Zhesi Li,Man Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A distillation framework for temporal knowledge graph reasoning using large language models as teachers improves efficiency and accuracy for lightweight student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TKG reasoning models are resource-intensive, hindering deployment on low-power platforms, and current compression techniques fail to capture temporal dependencies.

Method: Proposes a distillation framework leveraging large language models to transfer structural and temporal reasoning capabilities to lightweight student models.

Result: Outperforms baselines on benchmark datasets, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and deployability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses resource constraints while maintaining strong reasoning performance for TKGs.

Abstract: Reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) is fundamental to improving the efficiency and reliability of intelligent decision-making systems and has become a key technological foundation for future artificial intelligence applications. Despite recent progress, existing TKG reasoning models typically rely on large parameter sizes and intensive computation, leading to high hardware costs and energy consumption. These constraints hinder their deployment on resource-constrained, low-power, and distributed platforms that require real-time inference. Moreover, most existing model compression and distillation techniques are designed for static knowledge graphs and fail to adequately capture the temporal dependencies inherent in TKGs, often resulting in degraded reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose a distillation framework specifically tailored for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Our approach leverages large language models as teacher models to guide the distillation process, enabling effective transfer of both structural and temporal reasoning capabilities to lightweight student models. By integrating large-scale public knowledge with task-specific temporal information, the proposed framework enhances the student model's ability to model temporal dynamics while maintaining a compact and efficient architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving a favorable trade-off between reasoning accuracy, computational efficiency, and practical deployability.

*Jinning Zhang,Jie Song,Wenhui Tu,Zecheng Li,Jingxuan Li,Jin Li,Xuan Liu,Taole Sha,Zichen Wei,Yan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a strategy integrating Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) principles into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for improved accuracy and alignment in medical LLMs, validated in sports rehabilitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG approaches overlook EBM principles like PICO alignment and evidence hierarchy, limiting their effectiveness in medicine.

Method: The study adapts EBM to graph-based RAG by incorporating the PICO framework into knowledge graph construction and introducing a Bayesian-inspired reranking algorithm.

Result: The system achieved high scores in nugget coverage (0.830), answer faithfulness (0.819), semantic similarity (0.882), and PICOT match accuracy (0.788), with expert ratings averaging 4.66-4.84.

Conclusion: The EBM adaptation strategy enhances retrieval and answer quality, is transferable to other domains, and addresses dataset scarcity in sports rehabilitation.

Abstract: In medicine, large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground outputs in up-to-date external evidence. However, current RAG approaches focus primarily on performance improvements while overlooking evidence-based medicine (EBM) principles. This study addresses two key gaps: (1) the lack of PICO alignment between queries and retrieved evidence, and (2) the absence of evidence hierarchy considerations during reranking. We present a generalizable strategy for adapting EBM to graph-based RAG, integrating the PICO framework into knowledge graph construction and retrieval, and proposing a Bayesian-inspired reranking algorithm to calibrate ranking scores by evidence grade without introducing predefined weights. We validated this framework in sports rehabilitation, a literature-rich domain currently lacking RAG systems and benchmarks. We released a knowledge graph (357,844 nodes and 371,226 edges) and a reusable benchmark of 1,637 QA pairs. The system achieved 0.830 nugget coverage, 0.819 answer faithfulness, 0.882 semantic similarity, and 0.788 PICOT match accuracy. In a 5-point Likert evaluation, five expert clinicians rated the system 4.66-4.84 across factual accuracy, faithfulness, relevance, safety, and PICO alignment. These findings demonstrate that the proposed EBM adaptation strategy improves retrieval and answer quality and is transferable to other clinical domains. The released resources also help address the scarcity of RAG datasets in sports rehabilitation.

### [67] [JP-TL-Bench: Anchored Pairwise LLM Evaluation for Bidirectional Japanese-English Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00223)
*Leonard Lin,Adam Lensenmayer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JP-TL-Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate Japanese-English translation systems by focusing on nuanced quality comparisons rather than basic acceptability, using pairwise LLM judgments and a Bradley-Terry model for scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of evaluating subtle translation choices in Japanese-English, where nuances like politeness and implicature affect quality, requiring a reliable and affordable benchmark.

Method: The method involves using pairwise LLM comparisons against a fixed anchor set, aggregating results with a Bradley-Terry model, and scoring translations with win rates and a normalized LT score.

Result: The benchmark provides structurally stable scores for translation candidates, ensuring reliability and affordability in evaluation.

Conclusion: JP-TL-Bench offers a practical solution for iterative development of Japanese-English translation systems by focusing on nuanced quality assessment.

Abstract: We introduce JP-TL-Bench, a lightweight, open benchmark designed to guide the iterative development of Japanese-English translation systems. In this context, the challenge is often "which of these two good translations is better?" rather than "is this translation acceptable?" This distinction matters for Japanese-English, where subtle choices in politeness, implicature, ellipsis, and register strongly affect perceived naturalness. JP-TL-Bench uses a protocol built to make LLM judging both reliable and affordable: it evaluates a candidate model via reference-free, pairwise LLM comparisons against a fixed, versioned anchor set. Pairwise results are aggregated with a Bradley-Terry model and reported as win rates plus a normalized 0-10 "LT" score derived from a logistic transform of fitted log-strengths. Because each candidate is scored against the same frozen anchor set, scores are structurally stable given the same base set, judge, and aggregation code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study explores multilingual counterfactual generation by LLMs, comparing direct generation and translation-based methods, identifying edit patterns and error types, and evaluating their impact on model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of LLMs in generating multilingual counterfactuals is unclear, prompting a comprehensive study to evaluate their validity, edit patterns, errors, and impact on model performance.

Method: Automatic evaluations were conducted on directly generated and translation-based counterfactuals across six languages. Patterns of edits and error types were analyzed, and the impact of multilingual counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) was assessed.

Result: Translation-based counterfactuals are more valid but require more edits and don't match English counterfactual quality. Edit patterns are similar across high-resource European languages. Four main error types were identified. Multilingual CDA improves model performance more than cross-lingual CDA, especially for lower-resource languages, but imperfections limit gains.

Conclusion: Multilingual counterfactuals show promise but have limitations in quality and robustness. Further refinement is needed to maximize their utility in model performance improvement.

Abstract: Counterfactuals refer to minimally edited inputs that cause a model's prediction to change, serving as a promising approach to explaining the model's behavior. Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating English counterfactuals and demonstrate multilingual proficiency. However, their effectiveness in generating multilingual counterfactuals remains unclear. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study on multilingual counterfactuals. We first conduct automatic evaluations on both directly generated counterfactuals in the target languages and those derived via English translation across six languages. Although translation-based counterfactuals offer higher validity than their directly generated counterparts, they demand substantially more modifications and still fall short of matching the quality of the original English counterfactuals. Second, we find the patterns of edits applied to high-resource European-language counterfactuals to be remarkably similar, suggesting that cross-lingual perturbations follow common strategic principles. Third, we identify and categorize four main types of errors that consistently appear in the generated counterfactuals across languages. Finally, we reveal that multilingual counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) yields larger model performance improvements than cross-lingual CDA, especially for lower-resource languages. Yet, the imperfections of the generated counterfactuals limit gains in model performance and robustness.

TL;DR: WildAGTEval is a benchmark evaluating LLM agents' function-calling abilities under real-world API complexity, revealing significant performance drops due to irrelevant information and intent distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLM agents under realistic API complexities like noisy outputs and detailed constraints, which prior work overlooks.

Method: WildAGTEval includes 60 complexity scenarios forming ~32K test configurations and user-agent interactions to assess LLMs.

Result: Most scenarios are challenging, with irrelevant information causing a 27.3% performance drop; LLMs sometimes distort user intent.

Conclusion: WildAGTEval highlights LLMs' struggles with real-world API complexities, emphasizing the need for improved robustness.

Abstract: We introduce WildAGTEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language model (LLM) agents' function-calling capabilities under realistic API complexity. Unlike prior work that assumes an idealized API system and disregards real-world factors such as noisy API outputs, WildAGTEval accounts for two dimensions of real-world complexity: 1. API specification, which includes detailed documentation and usage constraints, and 2. API execution, which captures runtime challenges. Consequently, WildAGTEval offers (i) an API system encompassing 60 distinct complexity scenarios that can be composed into approximately 32K test configurations, and (ii) user-agent interactions for evaluating LLM agents on these scenarios. Using WildAGTEval, we systematically assess several advanced LLMs and observe that most scenarios are challenging, with irrelevant information complexity posing the greatest difficulty and reducing the performance of strong LLMs by 27.3%. Furthermore, our qualitative analysis reveals that LLMs occasionally distort user intent merely to claim task completion, critically affecting user satisfaction.

### [70] [Can Large Language Models Still Explain Themselves? Investigating the Impact of Quantization on Self-Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00282)
*Qianli Wang,Nils Feldhus,Pepa Atanasova,Fedor Splitt,Simon Ostermann,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Quantization impacts the quality and faithfulness of self-explanations (SEs) generated by LLMs, with modest declines observed across different techniques and bit widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of quantization on SEs is crucial for transparency in high-stakes applications, as SEs justify model outputs and reasoning processes.

Method: Examined NLEs and counterfactual examples from quantized LLMs using three techniques at varying bit widths.

Result: Quantization causes moderate declines in SE quality (up to 4.4%) and faithfulness (up to 2.38%). Larger models maintain faithfulness better but are less resilient in SE quality.

Conclusion: Quantization's impact varies; SE quality validation is recommended for specific use cases, though minor declines don't negate its effectiveness for model compression.

Abstract: Quantization is widely used to accelerate inference and streamline the deployment of large language models (LLMs), yet its effects on self-explanations (SEs) remain unexplored. SEs, generated by LLMs to justify their own outputs, require reasoning about the model's own decision-making process, a capability that may exhibit particular sensitivity to quantization. As SEs are increasingly relied upon for transparency in high-stakes applications, understanding whether and to what extent quantization degrades SE quality and faithfulness is critical. To address this gap, we examine two types of SEs: natural language explanations (NLEs) and counterfactual examples, generated by LLMs quantized using three common techniques at distinct bit widths. Our findings indicate that quantization typically leads to moderate declines in both SE quality (up to 4.4\%) and faithfulness (up to 2.38\%). The user study further demonstrates that quantization diminishes both the coherence and trustworthiness of SEs (up to 8.5\%). Compared to smaller models, larger models show limited resilience to quantization in terms of SE quality but better maintain faithfulness. Moreover, no quantization technique consistently excels across task accuracy, SE quality, and faithfulness. Given that quantization's impact varies by context, we recommend validating SE quality for specific use cases, especially for NLEs, which show greater sensitivity. Nonetheless, the relatively minor deterioration in SE quality and faithfulness does not undermine quantization's effectiveness as a model compression technique.

*Yuxin Li,Xiangyu Zhang,Yifei Li,Zhiwei Guo,Haoyang Zhang,Eng Siong Chng,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DepFlow is a three-stage framework addressing semantic bias in depression detection by disentangling depression from linguistic sentiment, improving robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets couple linguistic sentiment with depression labels, risking semantic shortcuts and reduced robustness in real-world scenarios like Camouflaged Depression.

Method: DepFlow involves adversarial training for depression embeddings, flow-matching TTS with FiLM modulation, and prototype-based severity mapping, creating acoustic-semantic mismatches for augmentation.

Result: DepFlow achieves ROC-AUC 0.693 for depression discriminability and improves macro-F1 by 9%, 12%, and 5% across models with its CDoA dataset.

Conclusion: DepFlow enhances robustness in depression detection, offers controllable synthesis for clinical applications, and addresses ethical data limitations.

Abstract: Speech is a scalable and non-invasive biomarker for early mental health screening. However, widely used depression datasets like DAIC-WOZ exhibit strong coupling between linguistic sentiment and diagnostic labels, encouraging models to learn semantic shortcuts. As a result, model robustness may be compromised in real-world scenarios, such as Camouflaged Depression, where individuals maintain socially positive or neutral language despite underlying depressive states. To mitigate this semantic bias, we propose DepFlow, a three-stage depression-conditioned text-to-speech framework. First, a Depression Acoustic Encoder learns speaker- and content-invariant depression embeddings through adversarial training, achieving effective disentanglement while preserving depression discriminability (ROC-AUC: 0.693). Second, a flow-matching TTS model with FiLM modulation injects these embeddings into synthesis, enabling control over depressive severity while preserving content and speaker identity. Third, a prototype-based severity mapping mechanism provides smooth and interpretable manipulation across the depression continuum. Using DepFlow, we construct a Camouflage Depression-oriented Augmentation (CDoA) dataset that pairs depressed acoustic patterns with positive/neutral content from a sentiment-stratified text bank, creating acoustic-semantic mismatches underrepresented in natural data. Evaluated across three depression detection architectures, CDoA improves macro-F1 by 9%, 12%, and 5%, respectively, consistently outperforming conventional augmentation strategies in depression Detection. Beyond enhancing robustness, DepFlow provides a controllable synthesis platform for conversational systems and simulation-based evaluation, where real clinical data remains limited by ethical and coverage constraints.

TL;DR: The paper addresses LLM hallucination by proposing a robust uncertainty quantification method (RU) tested on trap questions, showing improved performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM hallucination undermines reliability; existing methods fail with adversarial questions, necessitating better uncertainty quantification.

Method: Constructs trap questions with fake names and introduces RU, a novel uncertainty quantification method, validated through experiments.

Result: RU outperforms baselines, increasing ROCAUC by 0.1-0.2 across models, proving effective in detecting hallucinations.

Conclusion: RU offers a reliable solution for LLM hallucination, enhancing trustworthiness in AI-generated content.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model(LLM) technology has facilitated its integration into various domains of professional and daily life. However, the persistent challenge of LLM hallucination has emerged as a critical limitation, significantly compromising the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content. This challenge has garnered significant attention within the scientific community, prompting extensive research efforts in hallucination detection and mitigation strategies. Current methodological frameworks reveal a critical limitation: traditional uncertainty quantification approaches demonstrate effectiveness primarily within conventional question-answering paradigms, yet exhibit notable deficiencies when confronted with non-canonical or adversarial questioning strategies. This performance gap raises substantial concerns regarding the dependability of LLM responses in real-world applications requiring robust critical thinking capabilities. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing an uncertainty quantification scenario in the task of generating with multiple facts. We have meticulously constructed a set of trap questions contained with fake names. Based on this scenario, we innovatively propose a novel and robust uncertainty quantification method(RU). A series of experiments have been conducted to verify its effectiveness. The results show that the constructed set of trap questions performs excellently. Moreover, when compared with the baseline methods on four different models, our proposed method has demonstrated great performance, with an average increase of 0.1-0.2 in ROCAUC values compared to the best performing baseline method, providing new sights and methods for addressing the hallucination issue of LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multilingual large language models achieve impressive cross-lingual performance despite largely monolingual pretraining. While bilingual data in pretraining corpora is widely believed to enable these abilities, details of its contributions remain unclear. We investigate this question by pretraining models from scratch under controlled conditions, comparing the standard web corpus with a monolingual-only version that removes all multilingual documents. Despite constituting only 2% of the corpus, removing bilingual data causes translation performance to drop 56% in BLEU, while behaviour on cross-lingual QA and general reasoning tasks remains stable, with training curves largely overlapping the baseline. To understand this asymmetry, we categorize bilingual data into parallel (14%), code-switching (72%), and miscellaneous documents (14%) based on the semantic relevance of content in different languages. We then conduct granular ablations by reintroducing parallel or code-switching data into the monolingual-only corpus. Our experiments reveal that parallel data almost fully restores translation performance (91% of the unfiltered baseline), whereas code-switching contributes minimally. Other cross-lingual tasks remain largely unaffected by either type. These findings reveal that translation critically depends on systematic token-level alignments from parallel data, whereas cross-lingual understanding and reasoning appear to be achievable even without bilingual data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on synthetic annotations or external image retrieval, limiting interpretability and generalizability.

Method: Geo-R uses Chain of Region for rule-based hierarchical reasoning and lightweight reinforcement learning with coordinate-aligned rewards.

Result: The approach improves localization accuracy, generalization, and transparency across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Geo-R establishes a scalable, interpretable paradigm for image geolocalization, with plans to release the model and code publicly.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have opened up new possibilities for reasoning-driven image geolocalization. However, existing approaches often rely on synthetic reasoning annotations or external image retrieval, which can limit interpretability and generalizability. In this paper, we present Geo-R, a retrieval-free framework that uncovers structured reasoning paths from existing ground-truth coordinates and optimizes geolocation accuracy via reinforcement learning. We propose the Chain of Region, a rule-based hierarchical reasoning paradigm that generates precise, interpretable supervision by mapping GPS coordinates to geographic entities (e.g., country, province, city) without relying on model-generated or synthetic labels. Building on this, we introduce a lightweight reinforcement learning strategy with coordinate-aligned rewards based on Haversine distance, enabling the model to refine predictions through spatially meaningful feedback. Our approach bridges structured geographic reasoning with direct spatial supervision, yielding improved localization accuracy, stronger generalization, and more transparent inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of Geo-R, establishing a new retrieval-free paradigm for scalable and interpretable image geolocalization. To facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, both the model and code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of building NER datasets for under-represented languages like Luxembourgish due to resource scarcity and annotation inconsistency.

Method: Proposes a pipeline leveraging Wikipedia/Wikidata for weak supervision, using LLMs to filter high-quality annotations.

Result: Produces a Luxembourgish NER corpus five times larger than existing ones, with broader, balanced entity coverage.

Conclusion: judgeWEL provides a valuable resource for multilingual and low-resource NER research.

Abstract: We present judgeWEL, a dataset for named entity recognition (NER) in Luxembourgish, automatically labelled and subsequently verified using large language models (LLM) in a novel pipeline. Building datasets for under-represented languages remains one of the major bottlenecks in natural language processing, where the scarcity of resources and linguistic particularities make large-scale annotation costly and potentially inconsistent. To address these challenges, we propose and evaluate a novel approach that leverages Wikipedia and Wikidata as structured sources of weak supervision. By exploiting internal links within Wikipedia articles, we infer entity types based on their corresponding Wikidata entries, thereby generating initial annotations with minimal human intervention. Because such links are not uniformly reliable, we mitigate noise by employing and comparing several LLMs to identify and retain only high-quality labelled sentences. The resulting corpus is approximately five times larger than the currently available Luxembourgish NER dataset and offers broader and more balanced coverage across entity categories, providing a substantial new resource for multilingual and low-resource NER research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HTKGHs, a generalization of HTKGs, to better represent complex geopolitical events involving multiple entities. It formalizes HTKGHs, creates the htkgh-polecat dataset, and benchmarks LLMs for relation prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HTKGs lack expressive power for complex temporal facts involving more than two primary entities, common in real-world geopolitical events.

Method: The authors formalize HTKGHs to support complex facts, build the htkgh-polecat dataset using POLECAT, and benchmark LLMs for relation prediction.

Result: HTKGHs provide backward compatibility and support complex facts. The dataset and benchmarking offer insights into LLMs' capabilities in forecasting.

Conclusion: HTKGHs enhance representation of complex geopolitical events, and LLMs show potential in forecasting tasks, though adaptability varies.

Abstract: Forecasting on geopolitical temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) through the lens of large language models (LLMs) has recently gained traction. While TKGs and their generalization, hyper-relational temporal knowledge graphs (HTKGs), offer a straightforward structure to represent simple temporal relationships, they lack the expressive power to convey complex facts efficiently. One of the critical limitations of HTKGs is a lack of support for more than two primary entities in temporal facts, which commonly occur in real-world events. To address this limitation, in this work, we study a generalization of HTKGs, Hyper-Relational Temporal Knowledge Generalized Hypergraphs (HTKGHs). We first derive a formalization for HTKGHs, demonstrating their backward compatibility while supporting two complex types of facts commonly found in geopolitical incidents. Then, utilizing this formalization, we introduce the htkgh-polecat dataset, built upon the global event database POLECAT. Finally, we benchmark and analyze popular LLMs on the relation prediction task, providing insights into their adaptability and capabilities in complex forecasting scenarios.

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of DistilBERT, MiniLM, and ALBERT in enterprise NLP tasks shows trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, with each model excelling in specific areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for efficient, lightweight NLP models for multi-domain tasks drives the need to evaluate and compare leading Transformer models.

Method: Evaluated DistilBERT, MiniLM, and ALBERT on customer sentiment, news topic, and hate speech detection using IMDB, AG News, and Measuring Hate Speech datasets, measuring accuracy and efficiency metrics.

Result: No single model dominates; ALBERT excels in accuracy, MiniLM in speed, DistilBERT in consistency and efficiency.

Conclusion: Enterprise NLP applications should choose models based on specific needs: MiniLM for speed, DistilBERT for balance, ALBERT for accuracy with constraints.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of enterprise natural language processing (NLP), the demand for efficient, lightweight models capable of handling multi-domain text automation tasks has intensified. This study conducts a comparative analysis of three prominent lightweight Transformer models - DistilBERT, MiniLM, and ALBERT - across three distinct domains: customer sentiment classification, news topic classification, and toxicity and hate speech detection. Utilizing datasets from IMDB, AG News, and the Measuring Hate Speech corpus, we evaluated performance using accuracy-based metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as efficiency metrics such as model size, inference time, throughput, and memory usage. Key findings reveal that no single model dominates all performance dimensions. ALBERT achieves the highest task-specific accuracy in multiple domains, MiniLM excels in inference speed and throughput, and DistilBERT demonstrates the most consistent accuracy across tasks while maintaining competitive efficiency. All results reflect controlled fine-tuning under fixed enterprise-oriented constraints rather than exhaustive hyperparameter optimization. These results highlight trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, recommending MiniLM for latency-sensitive enterprise applications, DistilBERT for balanced performance, and ALBERT for resource-constrained environments.

### [79] [Language as Mathematical Structure: Examining Semantic Field Theory Against Language Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00448)
*Dimitris Vartziotis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper contrasts social constructivist and mathematical frameworks (Semantic Field Theory) in LLMs, showing their complementary roles in understanding language structure and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine long-standing linguistic theories through LLMs and reconcile social constructivist and mathematical perspectives.

Method: Formalizes lexical and linguistic fields in continuous semantic spaces and analyzes transformer architectures' properties.

Result: LLMs support underlying mathematical language structure but highlight limitations in pragmatic reasoning, aligning with social grounding theories.

Conclusion: Mathematical structure and language games are complementary, informing new AI architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a new empirical setting in which long-standing theories of linguistic meaning can be examined. This paper contrasts two broad approaches: social constructivist accounts associated with language games, and a mathematically oriented framework we call Semantic Field Theory. Building on earlier work by the author, we formalize the notions of lexical fields (Lexfelder) and linguistic fields (Lingofelder) as interacting structures in a continuous semantic space. We then analyze how core properties of transformer architectures-such as distributed representations, attention mechanisms, and geometric regularities in embedding spaces-relate to these concepts. We argue that the success of LLMs in capturing semantic regularities supports the view that language exhibits an underlying mathematical structure, while their persistent limitations in pragmatic reasoning and context sensitivity are consistent with the importance of social grounding emphasized in philosophical accounts of language use. On this basis, we suggest that mathematical structure and language games can be understood as complementary rather than competing perspectives. The resulting framework clarifies the scope and limits of purely statistical models of language and motivates new directions for theoretically informed AI architectures.

### [80] [Defensive M2S: Training Guardrail Models on Compressed Multi-turn Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00454)
*Hyunjun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Defensive M2S reduces computational costs for guardrail models by compressing multi-turn conversations into single-turn formats, achieving high efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of processing full multi-turn conversation histories in guardrail models for LLM safety.

Method: Training guardrail models on Multi-turn to Single-turn (M2S) compressed conversations instead of full dialogue histories, with formal complexity analysis.

Result: M2S reduced training tokens by 93x and inference tokens by 94.6%, achieving 93.8% attack detection recall.

Conclusion: Defensive M2S is an efficient technique for scalable safety screening of multi-turn conversations.

Abstract: Guardrail models are essential for ensuring the safety of Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, but processing full multi-turn conversation histories incurs significant computational cost. We propose Defensive M2S, a training paradigm that fine-tunes guardrail models on Multi-turn to Single-turn (M2S) compressed conversations rather than complete dialogue histories. We provide a formal complexity analysis showing that M2S reduces training cost from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ for $n$-turn conversations. Empirically, on our training dataset (779 samples, avg. 10.6 turns), M2S requires only 169K tokens compared to 15.7M tokens for the multi-turn baseline -- a 93$\times$ reduction. We evaluate Defensive M2S across three guardrail model families (LlamaGuard, Nemotron, Qwen3Guard) and three compression templates (hyphenize, numberize, pythonize) on SafeDialBench, a comprehensive multi-turn jailbreak benchmark. Our best configuration, Qwen3Guard with hyphenize compression, achieves 93.8% attack detection recall while reducing inference tokens by 94.6% (from 3,231 to 173 tokens per conversation). This represents a 38.9 percentage point improvement over the baseline while dramatically reducing both training and inference costs. Our findings demonstrate that M2S compression can serve as an effective efficiency technique for guardrail deployment, enabling scalable safety screening of long multi-turn conversations.

*Alexander M. Esser,Jens Dörpinghaus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A robust NER method for VET documents using noise-aware training, transfer learning, and multi-stage fine-tuning improves accuracy in noisy OCR conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing NER in VET documents with OCR noise requires a resilient approach.

Method: Leverages NAT with synthetic OCR errors, transfer learning, and multi-stage fine-tuning, comparing noisy, clean, and artificial data training.

Result: Domain-specific, noise-aware fine-tuning significantly boosts robustness and accuracy in noisy settings.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles noisy VET documents and is adaptable to other languages with available code.

Abstract: This paper addresses Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the domain of Vocational Education and Training (VET), focusing on historical, digitized documents that suffer from OCR-induced noise. We propose a robust NER approach leveraging Noise-Aware Training (NAT) with synthetically injected OCR errors, transfer learning, and multi-stage fine-tuning. Three complementary strategies, training on noisy, clean, and artificial data, are systematically compared. Our method is one of the first to recognize multiple entity types in VET documents. It is applied to German documents but transferable to arbitrary languages. Experimental results demonstrate that domain-specific and noise-aware fine-tuning substantially increases robustness and accuracy under noisy conditions. We provide publicly available code for reproducible noise-aware NER in domain-specific contexts.

*Lineesha Kamana,Akshita Ananda Subramanian,Mehuli Ghosh,Suman Saha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes how complex sentence structures affect rule-based atomic sentence extraction, identifying challenging patterns and evaluating performance using metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which linguistic structures cause extraction failures in atomic sentence decomposition, improving interpretability over machine learning methods.

Method: Implemented dependency-based extraction rules in spaCy using the WikiSplit dataset, evaluated with ROUGE and BERTScore on 100 gold-standard atomic sentence sets.

Result: Achieved moderate-to-high alignment (ROUGE-1 F1 = 0.6714, BERTScore F1 = 0.5898), with challenges in relative clauses, appositions, and passive constructions.

Conclusion: Rule-based extraction is accurate but sensitive to syntactic complexity, highlighting areas needing improvement.

Abstract: Natural language often combines multiple ideas into complex sentences. Atomic sentence extraction, the task of decomposing complex sentences into simpler sentences that each express a single idea, improves performance in information retrieval, question answering, and automated reasoning systems. Previous work has formalized the "split-and-rephrase" task and established evaluation metrics, and machine learning approaches using large language models have improved extraction accuracy. However, these methods lack interpretability and provide limited insight into which linguistic structures cause extraction failures. Although some studies have explored dependency-based extraction of subject-verb-object triples and clauses, no principled analysis has examined which specific clause structures and dependencies lead to extraction difficulties. This study addresses this gap by analyzing how complex sentence structures, including relative clauses, adverbial clauses, coordination patterns, and passive constructions, affect the performance of rule-based atomic sentence extraction. Using the WikiSplit dataset, we implemented dependency-based extraction rules in spaCy, generated 100 gold=standard atomic sentence sets, and evaluated performance using ROUGE and BERTScore. The system achieved ROUGE-1 F1 = 0.6714, ROUGE-2 F1 = 0.478, ROUGE-L F1 = 0.650, and BERTScore F1 = 0.5898, indicating moderate-to-high lexical, structural, and semantic alignment. Challenging structures included relative clauses, appositions, coordinated predicates, adverbial clauses, and passive constructions. Overall, rule-based extraction is reasonably accurate but sensitive to syntactic complexity.

*Yuelyu Ji,Zhuochun Li,Rui Meng,Daqing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper surveys multi-hop QA systems, focusing on execution procedures, and introduces a framework with four axes to analyze and compare methods. It highlights trade-offs and open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make procedural choices in multi-hop QA systems explicit and comparable, as current methods often leave the retrieval-reasoning process implicit.

Method: Introduces a four-axis framework (execution plan, index structure, next-step control, stop/continue criteria) to analyze and map multi-hop QA systems, using standard benchmarks.

Result: Identifies trade-offs among effectiveness, efficiency, and evidence faithfulness, and maps tendencies in existing systems.

Conclusion: Highlights open challenges like structure-aware planning, transferable control policies, and robust stopping under distribution shift.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (QA) requires systems to iteratively retrieve evidence and reason across multiple hops. While recent RAG and agentic methods report strong results, the underlying retrieval--reasoning \emph{process} is often left implicit, making procedural choices hard to compare across model families. This survey takes the execution procedure as the unit of analysis and introduces a four-axis framework covering (A) overall execution plan, (B) index structure, (C) next-step control (strategies and triggers), and (D) stop/continue criteria. Using this schema, we map representative multi-hop QA systems and synthesize reported ablations and tendencies on standard benchmarks (e.g., HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue), highlighting recurring trade-offs among effectiveness, efficiency, and evidence faithfulness. We conclude with open challenges for retrieval--reasoning agents, including structure-aware planning, transferable control policies, and robust stopping under distribution shift.

### [84] [ECR: Manifold-Guided Semantic Cues for Compact Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00543)
*Chung-Wei Victor Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECR is a new framework that preserves the semantic structure in compact models by regulating embedding consistency around precomputed anchors, improving stability and alignment without altering runtime behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compression methods often cause semantic drift and structural collapse in compact models, especially with tight capacity or multilingual data, hindering downstream task performance.

Method: ECR derives semantic anchors from teacher embeddings offline and trains the compact model to maintain consistent geometry around these anchors, avoiding reliance on logits or internal features.

Result: ECR stabilizes training, preserves semantic structure across tasks and languages, and enables cleaner manifolds in low-capacity models compared to baselines.

Conclusion: ECR improves compact models' alignment with task requirements and facilitates deployment under efficiency or privacy constraints.

Abstract: Compact models often lose the structure of their embedding space. The issue shows up when the capacity is tight or the data spans several languages. Such collapse makes it difficult for downstream tasks to build on the resulting representation. Existing compression methods focus on aligning model outputs at a superficial level but fail to preserve the underlying manifold structure. This mismatch often leads to semantic drift in the compact model, causing both task behavior and linguistic properties to deviate from the reference model.
  To address those issues, we provide a new framework called Embedding Consistency Regulation (ECR). This framework first derives a set of semantic anchors from teacher embeddings (computed once offline). Then, the compact model learns to maintain consistent geometry around these anchors, without relying on matching logits or internal features. ECR adds only a small projection step at inference, without altering the decoding architecture or its runtime behavior.
  In experiments on a 100K multilingual corpus, ECR consistently stabilizes training and preserves semantic structure across tasks and languages. It also produces a more compact and task-aligned representation space, enabling low-capacity models to learn cleaner manifolds than conventional baselines. ECR works without teacher outputs and is compatible with, but independent of, distillation. Taken together, our results show that ECR helps compact models better follow task requirements and makes them easier to deploy under strict efficiency or privacy limits.

*Yuang Zheng,Yuxiang Mei,Dongxing Xu,Jie Chen,Yanhua Long*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a lightweight, language-agnostic multilingual ASR system using CTC with domain adaptation via HLoRA-MoE framework, achieving efficient single-pass decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses high computational costs of large-scale mASR models like Whisper, aiming for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Introduces HLoRA-MoE framework in mHuBERT-CTC model for end-to-end decoding, combining shared LoRA (language-invariant) and language-specific LoRA experts.

Result: Competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods on MSR-86K and MLC-SLM datasets, improving efficiency for low-resource mASR.

Conclusion: HLoRA enables efficient, language-agnostic mASR without prior language info, suitable for edge devices.

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR (mASR) models such as Whisper achieve strong performance but incur high computational and latency costs, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this study, we propose a lightweight and language-agnostic multilingual ASR system based on a CTC architecture with domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a Language-agnostic Hierarchical LoRA-MoE (HLoRA) framework integrated into an mHuBERT-CTC model, enabling end-to-end decoding via LID-posterior-driven LoRA routing. The hierarchical design consists of a multilingual shared LoRA for learning language-invariant acoustic representations and language-specific LoRA experts for modeling language-dependent characteristics. The proposed routing mechanism removes the need for prior language identity information or explicit language labels during inference, achieving true language-agnostic decoding. Experiments on MSR-86K and the MLC-SLM 2025 Challenge datasets demonstrate that HLoRA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art two-stage inference methods using only single-pass decoding, significantly improving decoding efficiency for low-resource mASR applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmark creation for LLMs is expensive and time-consuming, and existing benchmarks often contaminate training data, requiring novel methods for accurate evaluation.

Result: The method generates accurate test cases and solutions 97% of the time, with higher novelty and diversity compared to seed datasets.

Conclusion: InfoSynth provides a scalable, self-verifying pipeline for creating high-quality benchmarks for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in reasoning and code generation. However, efficiently creating new benchmarks to evaluate these capabilities remains a challenge. Traditional benchmark creation relies on manual human effort, a process that is both expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, existing benchmarks often contaminate LLM training data, necessitating novel and diverse benchmarks to accurately assess their genuine capabilities. This work introduces InfoSynth, a novel framework for automatically generating and evaluating reasoning benchmarks guided by information-theoretic principles. We propose metrics based on KL-divergence and entropy to quantify benchmark novelty and diversity without relying on costly model evaluations. Building on this framework, we develop an end-to-end pipeline that synthesizes robust Python coding problems from seed datasets using genetic algorithms and iterative code feedback. Our method generates accurate test cases and solutions to new problems 97% of the time, and the synthesized benchmarks consistently exhibit higher novelty and diversity compared to their seed datasets. Moreover, our algorithm provides a method for controlling the novelty/diversity and difficulty of generated problems. InfoSynth offers a scalable, self-verifying pipeline for constructing high-quality, novel and diverse benchmarks for LLMs. Project Page: https://ishirgarg.github.io/infosynth_web/

*Zhenhong Zhou,Shilinlu Yan,Chuanpu Liu,Qiankun Li,Kun Wang,Zhigang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CSSBench addresses the safety evaluation gap for lightweight LLMs in Chinese by testing adversarial patterns like homophones and pinyin, revealing vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the safety of lightweight LLMs in Chinese, as existing benchmarks focus on English and miss Chinese-specific adversarial patterns.

Method: Introduces CSSBench, a benchmark covering six real-world Chinese domains, organizing queries into task types to test adversarial patterns.

Result: Lightweight LLMs struggle with Chinese-specific adversarial patterns, showing over-refusal behavior and performance degradation.

Conclusion: CSSBench effectively highlights safety challenges for lightweight LLMs in Chinese, aiding robust deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in cost-sensitive and on-device scenarios, and safety guardrails have advanced mainly in English. However, real-world Chinese malicious queries typically conceal intent via homophones, pinyin, symbol-based splitting, and other Chinese-specific patterns. These Chinese-specific adversarial patterns create the safety evaluation gap that is not well captured by existing benchmarks focused on English. This gap is particularly concerning for lightweight models, which may be more vulnerable to such specific adversarial perturbations. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Chinese-Specific Safety Benchmark (CSSBench) that emphasizes these adversarial patterns and evaluates the safety of lightweight LLMs in Chinese. Our benchmark covers six domains that are common in real Chinese scenarios, including illegal activities and compliance, privacy leakage, health and medical misinformation, fraud and hate, adult content, and public and political safety, and organizes queries into multiple task types. We evaluate a set of popular lightweight LLMs and measure over-refusal behavior to assess safety-induced performance degradation. Our results show that the Chinese-specific adversarial pattern is a critical challenge for lightweight LLMs. This benchmark offers a comprehensive evaluation of LLM safety in Chinese, assisting robust deployments in practice.

*Sumanth Balaji,Piyush Mishra,Aashraya Sachdeva,Suraj Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JourneyBench introduces a benchmark to evaluate LLM agents' adherence to business policies in customer support, outperforming traditional IVR systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IVR systems lack flexibility for complex tasks, and existing benchmarks overlook agents' policy adherence.

Method: JourneyBench uses graph representations for realistic scenarios and proposes a User Journey Coverage Score metric.

Result: Dynamic-Prompt Agent (DPA) improves policy adherence, enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones.

Conclusion: Structured orchestration is key, and JourneyBench advances AI-driven customer support beyond IVR limitations.

Abstract: Traditional customer support systems, such as Interactive Voice Response (IVR), rely on rigid scripts and lack the flexibility required for handling complex, policy-driven tasks. While large language model (LLM) agents offer a promising alternative, evaluating their ability to act in accordance with business rules and real-world support workflows remains an open challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on tool usage or task completion, overlooking an agent's capacity to adhere to multi-step policies, navigate task dependencies, and remain robust to unpredictable user or environment behavior. In this work, we introduce JourneyBench, a benchmark designed to assess policy-aware agents in customer support. JourneyBench leverages graph representations to generate diverse, realistic support scenarios and proposes the User Journey Coverage Score, a novel metric to measure policy adherence. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs using two agent designs: a Static-Prompt Agent (SPA) and a Dynamic-Prompt Agent (DPA) that explicitly models policy control. Across 703 conversations in three domains, we show that DPA significantly boosts policy adherence, even allowing smaller models like GPT-4o-mini to outperform more capable ones like GPT-4o. Our findings demonstrate the importance of structured orchestration and establish JourneyBench as a critical resource to advance AI-driven customer support beyond IVR-era limitations.

### [89] [Probabilistic Guarantees for Reducing Contextual Hallucinations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00641)
*Nils Rautenberg,Sven Schippkus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework is introduced to reduce hallucinations in LLM outputs for deterministic workflows by using repeated prompts and an LLM-as-a-judge, with exponential error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs are problematic for deterministic workflows where correctness is critical.

Method: Uses repeated prompts for exponential error reduction and incorporates an LLM-as-a-judge, optionally strengthened by majority voting.

Result: Experimental results confirm exponential reduction in pipeline failure and hallucination-selection with increased repetitions and judges.

Conclusion: The framework offers a lightweight, theory-backed method to minimize hallucinations in fixed-input LLM workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce contextual hallucinations, where generated content contradicts or ignores information explicitly stated in the prompt. Such errors are particularly problematic in deterministic automation workflows, where inputs are fixed and correctness is unambiguous. We introduce a simple and model-agnostic framework that provides explicit probabilistic guarantees for reducing hallucinations in this setting.
  We formalize the notion of a specific task, defined by a fixed input and a deterministic correctness criterion, and show that issuing the same prompt in independent context windows yields an exponential reduction in the probability that all model outputs are incorrect. To identify a correct answer among repeated runs, we incorporate an LLM-as-a-judge and prove that the probability that the judged pipeline fails decays at a rate determined by the judge's true- and false-positive probabilities. When the judge is imperfect, we strengthen it through majority vote over independent judge calls, obtaining ensemble-level error rates that decrease exponentially in the number of votes. This yields an explicit bound on the probability that the pipeline selects a hallucinated answer.
  Experiments on controlled extraction tasks with synthetic noisy judges match these predictions exactly: pipeline failure decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, and hallucination-selection decreases exponentially with the number of judges in the ensemble. Together, these results provide a lightweight, modular, and theoretically grounded method for driving hallucination probabilities arbitrarily low in fixed-input LLM workflows-without modifying model weights, decoding strategies, or prompt engineering.

TL;DR: Physio-DPO, a physics-informed alignment framework, improves protein language models by grounding them in thermodynamic stability, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein language models often generate sequences with high linguistic likelihood but unstable structures due to structural hallucinations. Existing methods like DPO are limited as they treat preferences as binary and ignore the continuous energy landscape.

Method: Physio-DPO introduces a magnitude-aware objective that scales optimization updates based on the energy gap between native structures and physics-perturbed hard negatives.

Result: Physio-DPO reduces self-consistency RMSD to 1.28 Å and increases foldability to 92.8%, outperforming baselines like SFT, PPO, and standard DPO.

Conclusion: Physio-DPO effectively mitigates structural hallucinations by recovering biophysical interactions, enhancing the reliability of generative protein design.

Abstract: Large Protein Language Models have shown strong potential for generative protein design, yet they frequently produce structural hallucinations, generating sequences with high linguistic likelihood that fold into thermodynamically unstable conformations. Existing alignment approaches such as Direct Preference Optimization are limited in this setting, as they model preferences as binary labels and ignore the continuous structure of the physical energy landscape. We propose Physio-DPO, a physics informed alignment framework that grounds protein language models in thermodynamic stability. Physio-DPO introduces a magnitude aware objective that scales optimization updates according to the energy gap between native structures and physics perturbed hard negatives. Experiments show that Physio-DPO consistently outperforms strong baselines including SFT, PPO, and standard DPO, reducing self consistency RMSD to 1.28 Å and increasing foldability to 92.8%. Qualitative analysis further demonstrates that Physio-DPO effectively mitigates structural hallucinations by recovering biophysical interactions such as hydrophobic core packing and hydrogen bond networks.

TL;DR: FwPKM resolves the trade-off between storage capacity and computational efficiency in sequence modeling by dynamically updating parameters as an episodic memory, outperforming static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the tension between unbounded storage (high cost) and fixed-size storage (efficiency) in sequence modeling layers.

Method: Proposes Fast-weight Product Key Memory (FwPKM), transforming static PKM into dynamic episodic memory with local gradient updates during training and inference.

Result: Achieves significant perplexity reductions on long-context datasets and generalizes to 128K tokens from 4K-token training.

Conclusion: FwPKM effectively complements semantic memory and enhances long-context handling in language models.

Abstract: Sequence modeling layers in modern language models typically face a trade-off between storage capacity and computational efficiency. While Softmax attention offers unbounded storage at prohibitive quadratic costs, linear variants provide efficiency but suffer from limited, fixed-size storage. We propose Fast-weight Product Key Memory (FwPKM), a novel architecture that resolves this tension by transforming the sparse Product Key Memory (PKM) from a static module into a dynamic, "fast-weight" episodic memory. Unlike PKM, FwPKM updates its parameters dynamically at both training and inference time via local chunk-level gradient descent, allowing the model to rapidly memorize and retrieve new key-value pairs from input sequences. Experiments reveal that FwPKM functions as an effective episodic memory that complements the semantic memory of standard modules, yielding significant perplexity reductions on long-context datasets. Notably, in Needle in a Haystack evaluations, FwPKM generalizes to 128K-token contexts despite being trained on only 4K-token sequences.

### [92] [Sigmoid Head for Quality Estimation under Language Ambiguity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00680)
*Tu Anh Dinh,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the unreliability of LM probability as a quality estimator due to language ambiguity and proposes a Sigmoid Head module for better quality estimation without needing human-annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LM probability distributions spread across valid output options, misleadingly indicating low quality. Limitations include softmax activation and single-reference training data.

Method: Proposes a Sigmoid Head module with sigmoid activation to allow multiple correct options and heuristic-based negative sampling to avoid correct alternatives.

Result: Sigmoid Head provides a better quality signal than softmax and is robust in out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: The Sigmoid Head is an effective, efficient solution for LM-based quality estimation without reliance on annotated data.

Abstract: Language model (LM) probability is not a reliable quality estimator, as natural language is ambiguous. When multiple output options are valid, the model's probability distribution is spread across them, which can misleadingly indicate low output quality. This issue is caused by two reasons: (1) LMs' final output activation is softmax, which does not allow multiple correct options to receive high probabilities simultaneuously and (2) LMs' training data is single, one-hot encoded references, indicating that there is only one correct option at each output step. We propose training a module for Quality Estimation on top of pre-trained LMs to address these limitations. The module, called Sigmoid Head, is an extra unembedding head with sigmoid activation to tackle the first limitation. To tackle the second limitation, during the negative sampling process to train the Sigmoid Head, we use a heuristic to avoid selecting potentially alternative correct tokens. Our Sigmoid Head is computationally efficient during training and inference. The probability from Sigmoid Head is notably better quality signal compared to the original softmax head. As the Sigmoid Head does not rely on human-annotated quality data, it is more robust to out-of-domain settings compared to supervised QE.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs for text span identification in sentiment analysis, offensive language detection, and claim verification, exploring strategies like instruction tuning and in-context learning. Results show text relationships improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in subjective span identification tasks like ABSA using LLMs, which has been underexplored compared to explicit tasks like NER.

Method: Evaluates various LLMs across three tasks, employing strategies such as instruction tuning, in-context learning, and chain of thought.

Result: LLMs perform better in span identification when leveraging underlying text relationships.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of LLMs in subjective span identification tasks and underscores the importance of text relationships for precise span detection.

Abstract: Identifying relevant text spans is important for several downstream tasks in NLP, as it contributes to model explainability. While most span identification approaches rely on relatively smaller pre-trained language models like BERT, a few recent approaches have leveraged the latest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task. Current work has focused on explicit span identification like Named Entity Recognition (NER), while more subjective span identification with LLMs in tasks like Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has been underexplored. In this paper, we fill this important gap by presenting an evaluation of the performance of various LLMs on text span identification in three popular tasks, namely sentiment analysis, offensive language identification, and claim verification. We explore several LLM strategies like instruction tuning, in-context learning, and chain of thought. Our results indicate underlying relationships within text aid LLMs in identifying precise text spans.

*Jonathan Simkin,Lovedeep Gondara,Zeeshan Rizvi,Gregory Doyle,Jeff Dowden,Dan Bond,Desmond Martin,Raymond Ng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates adapting BCCRTron and GatorTron transformer models for cancer surveillance across Canadian provinces, showing high performance with modest fine-tuning and improved sensitivity through ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual abstraction of pathology reports is resource-intensive and delays cancer data. Transformer-based NLP systems can improve workflows, but their adaptability across jurisdictions with varying reporting conventions is unclear.

Method: The study fine-tuned BCCRTron and GatorTron models using NLCR pathology reports for Tier 1 (cancer vs. non-cancer) and Tier 2 (reportable vs. non-reportable) tasks. An OR-ensemble of the models was used to improve sensitivity.

Result: The ensemble achieved 0.99 recall for both tasks, reducing missed cancers (Tier 1: 24 vs. 48/54 standalone) and reportable cancers (Tier 2: 33 vs. 54/46 standalone).

Conclusion: Transformer models can be localized across jurisdictions with modest fine-tuning. Ensembles improve sensitivity and reduce missed cancers, supporting interoperable NLP infrastructure for cancer registries.

Abstract: Population-based cancer registries depend on pathology reports as their primary diagnostic source, yet manual abstraction is resource-intensive and contributes to delays in cancer data. While transformer-based NLP systems have improved registry workflows, their ability to generalize across jurisdictions with differing reporting conventions remains poorly understood. We present the first cross-provincial evaluation of adapting BCCRTron, a domain-adapted transformer model developed at the British Columbia Cancer Registry, alongside GatorTron, a biomedical transformer model, for cancer surveillance in Canada. Our training dataset consisted of approximately 104,000 and 22,000 de-identified pathology reports from the Newfoundland & Labrador Cancer Registry (NLCR) for Tier 1 (cancer vs. non-cancer) and Tier 2 (reportable vs. non-reportable) tasks, respectively. Both models were fine-tuned using complementary synoptic and diagnosis focused report section input pipelines. Across NLCR test sets, the adapted models maintained high performance, demonstrating transformers pretrained in one jurisdiction can be localized to another with modest fine-tuning. To improve sensitivity, we combined the two models using a conservative OR-ensemble achieving a Tier 1 recall of 0.99 and reduced missed cancers to 24, compared with 48 and 54 for the standalone models. For Tier 2, the ensemble achieved 0.99 recall and reduced missed reportable cancers to 33, compared with 54 and 46 for the individual models. These findings demonstrate that an ensemble combining complementary text representations substantially reduce missed cancers and improve error coverage in cancer-registry NLP. We implement a privacy-preserving workflow in which only model weights are shared between provinces, supporting interoperable NLP infrastructure and a future pan-Canadian foundation model for cancer pathology and registry workflows.

### [95] [μACP: A Formal Calculus for Expressive, Resource-Constrained Agent Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00219)
*Arnab Mallick,Indraveni Chebolu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: $μ$ACP is a formal calculus designed for expressive agent communication under resource constraints, balancing semantic richness with efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing protocols either lack expressiveness (IoT protocols) or are too resource-intensive (FIPA-ACL). $μ$ACP aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Introduces the Resource-Constrained Agent Communication (RCAC) model, uses a minimal verb basis, and establishes tight bounds on message complexity.

Result: $μ$ACP achieves low latency (median 34 ms) and outperforms prior protocols under severe constraints, verified via formal methods.

Conclusion: $μ$ACP provides a rigorous foundation for resource-constrained multi-agent systems, unifying expressiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Agent communication remains a foundational problem in multi-agent systems: protocols such as FIPA-ACL guarantee semantic richness but are intractable for constrained environments, while lightweight IoT protocols achieve efficiency at the expense of expressiveness. This paper presents $μ$ACP, a formal calculus for expressive agent communication under explicit resource bounds. We formalize the Resource-Constrained Agent Communication (RCAC) model, prove that a minimal four-verb basis \textit{\{PING, TELL, ASK, OBSERVE\}} is suffices to encode finite-state FIPA protocols, and establish tight information-theoretic bounds on message complexity. We further show that $μ$ACP can implement standard consensus under partial synchrony and crash faults, yielding a constructive coordination framework for edge-native agents. Formal verification in TLA$^{+}$ (model checking) and Coq (mechanized invariants) establishes safety and boundedness, and supports liveness under modeled assumptions. Large-scale system simulations confirm ACP achieves a median end-to-end message latency of 34 ms (95th percentile 104 ms) at scale, outperforming prior agent and IoT protocols under severe resource constraints. The main contribution is a unified calculus that reconciles semantic expressiveness with provable efficiency, providing a rigorous foundation for the next generation of resource-constrained multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-gen wireless technologies like 5G and 6G require advanced decision-making due to increased complexity from interconnected devices, but traditional RL methods face limitations in cost, safety, and scalability.

Method: Proposes an offline MARL algorithm based on CQL, extended with meta-learning for dynamic environments, and tests it in radio resource management and UAV networks.

Result: Demonstrates safe and efficient training without real-time interaction, addressing high-dimensional challenges in wireless applications.

Conclusion: Offline MARL shows promise for wireless networks but has limitations; future work should explore its broader applications and improvements.

Abstract: The next-generation wireless technologies, including beyond 5G and 6G networks, are paving the way for transformative applications such as vehicle platooning, smart cities, and remote surgery. These innovations are driven by a vast array of interconnected wireless entities, including IoT devices, access points, UAVs, and CAVs, which increase network complexity and demand more advanced decision-making algorithms. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), especially reinforcement learning (RL), are key enablers for such networks, providing solutions to high-dimensional and complex challenges. However, as networks expand to multi-agent environments, traditional online RL approaches face cost, safety, and scalability limitations. Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a promising solution by utilizing pre-collected data, reducing the need for real-time interaction. This article introduces a novel offline MARL algorithm based on conservative Q-learning (CQL), ensuring safe and efficient training. We extend this with meta-learning to address dynamic environments and validate the approach through use cases in radio resource management and UAV networks. Our work highlights offline MARL's advantages, limitations, and future directions in wireless applications.

Result: 2

Conclusion: ]

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems become increasingly autonomous, evidence shows they can develop collusive strategies similar to those long observed in human markets and institutions. While human domains have accumulated centuries of anti-collusion mechanisms, it remains unclear how these can be adapted to AI settings. This paper addresses that gap by (i) developing a taxonomy of human anti-collusion mechanisms, including sanctions, leniency & whistleblowing, monitoring & auditing, market design, and governance and (ii) mapping them to potential interventions for multi-agent AI systems. For each mechanism, we propose implementation approaches. We also highlight open challenges, such as the attribution problem (difficulty attributing emergent coordination to specific agents) identity fluidity (agents being easily forked or modified) the boundary problem (distinguishing beneficial cooperation from harmful collusion) and adversarial adaptation (agents learning to evade detection).

### [98] [Evaluating Anomaly Detectors for Simulated Highly Imbalanced Industrial Classification Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00005)
*Lesley Wheat,Martin v. Mohrenschildt,Saeid Habibi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates anomaly detection algorithms using synthetic data to address class imbalance in industrial machine learning, revealing performance dependence on the number of faulty examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle extreme class imbalance in industrial machine learning applications like quality control and predictive maintenance, where faulty data is scarce.

Method: Benchmarked 14 detectors on synthetic datasets with varying anomaly rates (0.05%-20%) and training sizes (1,000-10,000), assessing performance and generalization.

Result: Best detector depends on faulty examples: unsupervised methods excel with <20, supervised/semi-supervised improve with 30-50. Performance drops on smaller datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for deploying anomaly detection in industry, emphasizing the need for sufficient faulty examples and dataset size considerations.

Abstract: Machine learning offers potential solutions to current issues in industrial systems in areas such as quality control and predictive maintenance, but also faces unique barriers in industrial applications. An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments.

### [99] [Yahtzee: Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Stochastic Combinatorial Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00007)
*Nicholas A. Pape*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Yahtzee as an RL benchmark, comparing policy gradient methods (REINFORCE, A2C, PPO) for multiplayer gameplay. A2C performs best, nearing optimal scores, but struggles with long-term strategies like the upper bonus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Yahtzee's stochastic and combinatorial nature makes it a compelling RL benchmark, especially for multiplayer scenarios where exact solutions are intractable.

Method: Formulated Yahtzee as an MDP, trained self-play agents using REINFORCE, A2C, and PPO with a shared neural network. Conducted ablations on features, encodings, architecture, and regularization.

Result: A2C outperformed REINFORCE and PPO, achieving median scores close to optimal (241.78 vs. 254.59). Models struggled with upper bonus strategies, favoring short-term gains.

Conclusion: A2C is robust for Yahtzee, but challenges remain in long-horizon credit assignment and exploration, particularly for upper bonus strategies.

Abstract: Yahtzee is a classic dice game with a stochastic, combinatorial structure and delayed rewards, making it an interesting mid-scale RL benchmark. While an optimal policy for solitaire Yahtzee can be computed using dynamic programming methods, multiplayer is intractable, motivating approximation methods. We formulate Yahtzee as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and train self-play agents using various policy gradient methods: REINFORCE, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), all using a multi-headed network with a shared trunk. We ablate feature and action encodings, architecture, return estimators, and entropy regularization to understand their impact on learning. Under a fixed training budget, REINFORCE and PPO prove sensitive to hyperparameters and fail to reach near-optimal performance, whereas A2C trains robustly across a range of settings. Our agent attains a median score of 241.78 points over 100,000 evaluation games, within 5.0\% of the optimal DP score of 254.59, achieving the upper section bonus and Yahtzee at rates of 24.9\% and 34.1\%, respectively. All models struggle to learn the upper bonus strategy, overindexing on four-of-a-kind's, highlighting persistent long-horizon credit-assignment and exploration challenges.

### [100] [The Trojan in the Vocabulary: Stealthy Sabotage of LLM Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00065)
*Xiaoze Liu,Weichen Yu,Matt Fredrikson,Xiaoqian Wang,Jing Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a vulnerability in tokenizer transplant techniques used in LLM composition, demonstrating how a single 'breaker token' can be engineered to sabotage a base model's generation while evading detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to expose a hidden risk in the interoperability pipeline of modular AI composition, specifically focusing on how tokenizer transplant methods can introduce supply-chain vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors formalize the attack as a dual-objective optimization problem, engineer a 'breaker token' that reconstructs into a malicious feature after transplant, and use a sparse solver to instantiate the attack.

Result: Empirically, the attack is training-free, evades outlier detection through spectral mimicry, and persists against fine-tuning and weight merging.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that tokenizer transplant techniques introduce a critical vulnerability, highlighting the need for safeguards in modular AI composition pipelines.

Abstract: The open-weight LLM ecosystem is increasingly defined by model composition techniques (such as weight merging, speculative decoding, and vocabulary expansion) that remix capabilities from diverse sources. A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single "breaker token" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

### [101] [IMBWatch -- a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network approach to detect Illicit Massage Business](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00075)
*Swetha Varadarajan,Abhishek Ray,Lumina Albert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IMBWatch is a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to detect Illicit Massage Businesses (IMBs) by analyzing dynamic graphs built from open-source data, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for detecting IMBs (like community tips and inspections) are reactive and ineffective. The covert nature of IMBs requires a proactive, scalable solution.

Method: IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from online ads, business records, and reviews, using nodes for entities and edges for spatio-temporal patterns. It combines graph convolution and temporal attention.

Result: IMBWatch achieves higher accuracy and F1 scores compared to baselines in real-world tests across U.S. cities. It also provides interpretable insights.

Conclusion: IMBWatch is scalable, adaptable, and supports proactive interventions. Its framework and anonymized data are open-source for reproducible research.

Abstract: Illicit Massage Businesses (IMBs) are a covert and persistent form of organized exploitation that operate under the facade of legitimate wellness services while facilitating human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and coerced labor. Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on.
  To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges.
  Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.

### [102] [Exploration in the Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00084)
*Brian M. Cho,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a relaxed asymptotic framework for fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI) to overcome limitations of existing methods, achieving tighter optimality and handling nonparametric distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BAI methods struggle in practical settings due to stringent exact error control requirements, which often lead to loose bounds or parametric restrictions. The proposed framework aims to address these issues for real-world applications with weak signals, high significance, and post-experiment inference needs.

Method: The authors develop an asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequence over arm indices, enabling a new BAI algorithm. The method incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in nonparametric settings.

Result: Asymptotic bounds on sample complexity are provided, showing worst-case performance matches the best-case of Gaussian BAI under known variances. Experiments demonstrate reduced average sample complexities with maintained error control.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a more flexible and practical solution for BAI, improving performance in nonparametric settings while meeting asymptotic error control requirements.

Abstract: In fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI), the objective is to quickly identify the optimal option while controlling the probability of error below a desired threshold. Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances. Experiments suggest our approach reduces average sample complexities while maintaining error control.

*Junqi Qu,Yan Zhang,Shangqian Gao,Shibo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroSymBO improves LLM performance in equation discovery by dynamically selecting optimal prompts using Bayesian Optimization, outperforming static prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address instruction brittleness in LLMs for equation discovery, where static prompts lead to suboptimal solutions.

Method: Propose NeuroSymBO, framing prompt engineering as a sequential decision problem with Bayesian Optimization to select optimal instructions dynamically.

Result: Outperforms fixed prompts in PDE discovery benchmarks, achieving higher recovery rates with simpler solutions.

Conclusion: Adaptive instruction selection via NeuroSymBO enhances LLM performance in multi-step equation discovery tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for equation discovery, yet their outputs are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, a phenomenon we term instruction brittleness. Static prompts cannot adapt to the evolving state of a multi-step generation process, causing models to plateau at suboptimal solutions. To address this, we propose NeuroSymBO, which reframes prompt engineering as a sequential decision problem. Our method maintains a discrete library of reasoning strategies and uses Bayesian Optimization to select the optimal instruction at each step based on numerical feedback. Experiments on PDE discovery benchmarks show that adaptive instruction selection significantly outperforms fixed prompts, achieving higher recovery rates with more parsimonious solutions.

### [104] [GRL-SNAM: Geometric Reinforcement Learning with Path Differential Hamiltonians for Simultaneous Navigation and Mapping in Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00116)
*Aditya Sai Ellendula,Yi Wang,Minh Nguyen,Chandrajit Bajaj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRL-SNAM is a reinforcement learning framework for Simultaneous Navigation and Mapping (SNAM) in unknown environments, using dynamic shortest path search and Hamiltonian optimization without global maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional navigation methods require global maps, which are unavailable in unknown environments. GRL-SNAM addresses this by using local sensory observations and dynamic Hamiltonian optimization.

Method: The framework translates sensory inputs into local energy landscapes for path navigation and mapping. Policies evolve via Hamiltonian updates, refining trajectories as new local information arrives.

Result: Evaluated on 2D navigation tasks, GRL-SNAM outperforms baselines by preserving clearance, generalizing to unseen layouts, and enabling high-quality navigation with minimal exploration.

Conclusion: GRL-SNAM demonstrates that geometric reinforcement learning via Hamiltonian updates can achieve efficient navigation and mapping without relying on global maps.

Abstract: We present GRL-SNAM, a geometric reinforcement learning framework for Simultaneous Navigation and Mapping(SNAM) in unknown environments. A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping. The code is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/CVC-Lab/GRL-SNAM}{Github}.

### [105] [Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation for Non-Markov Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00151)
*Ali Devran Kara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores reinforcement learning with linear function approximation in non-Markov settings, proving convergence for policy evaluation under ergodicity conditions and deriving error bounds for partially observed Markov processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend reinforcement learning methods to non-Markov environments, ensuring convergence and analyzing performance in scenarios like partially observed Markov decision processes.

Method: Uses policy evaluation and Q-learning with linear function approximation, focusing on ergodicity conditions and quantization maps for basis functions.

Result: Convergence proofs for policy evaluation under ergodicity, limited Q-learning convergence using quantization maps, and error bounds for partially observed Markov processes.

Conclusion: The study successfully extends reinforcement learning to non-Markov settings, providing theoretical guarantees and practical applications.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning methods with linear function approximation under non-Markov state and cost processes. We first consider the policy evaluation method and show that the algorithm converges under suitable ergodicity conditions on the underlying non-Markov processes. Furthermore, we show that the limit corresponds to the fixed point of a joint operator composed of an orthogonal projection and the Bellman operator of an auxiliary \emph{Markov} decision process.
  For Q-learning with linear function approximation, as in the Markov setting, convergence is not guaranteed in general. We show, however, that for the special case where the basis functions are chosen based on quantization maps, the convergence can be shown under similar ergodicity conditions. Finally, we apply our results to partially observed Markov decision processes, where finite-memory variables are used as state representations, and we derive explicit error bounds for the limits of the resulting learning algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study predicts U.S. traffic accident severity using environmental, temporal, and spatial factors with an XGBoost model, achieving 78% accuracy, but notes limitations with extreme cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how environmental, temporal, and spatial factors influence traffic accident severity for better traffic management.

Method: Used an XGBoost classifier trained on 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents (2016-2023), optimized via randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance.

Result: Final model achieved 78% accuracy, with strong performance for mid-level severity (87% precision/recall). Key predictors included time, location, and weather, but precipitation and visibility had limited impact.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better handling of extreme cases and suggests future work on sampling, feature engineering, and external data integration.

Abstract: This study investigates the predictive capacity of environmental, temporal, and spatial factors on traffic accident severity in the United States. Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets. These findings contribute to evidence-based traffic management and suggest future directions for severity prediction research.

*Junkai Luo,Yinglun Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decision Transformers (DTs) struggle with online RL gradients due to hindsight return relabeling, leading to unstable training. New algorithms are proposed for pure-RL-based online finetuning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>

Motivation: Extending DTs to online settings with pure RL gradients is largely unexplored, as existing methods rely on supervised objectives. The paper identifies hindsight return relabeling as incompatible with RL algorithms like GRPO.

Method: The authors adapt GRPO to DTs, incorporating sub-trajectory optimization, sequence-level likelihood objectives, and active sampling for exploration.

Result: The proposed methods outperform existing online DT baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Pure-RL-based online finetuning is effective for DTs, overcoming previous limitations.

Abstract: Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision making by formulating offline reinforcement learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. However, extending DTs to online settings with pure RL gradients remains largely unexplored, as existing approaches continue to rely heavily on supervised sequence-modeling objectives during online finetuning. We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods outperform existing online DT baselines and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of pure-RL-based online finetuning for Decision Transformers.

TL;DR: Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) improves forecasting in high-dimensional spatiotemporal systems by decomposing large reservoirs into smaller, interconnected ones, achieving better performance and efficiency than RNNs and LSTMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational challenges like gradient-based training and memory bottlenecks in RNNs and LSTMs for forecasting high-dimensional systems.

Method: Introduces Sequential RC, which uses smaller interconnected reservoirs instead of a single large one, reducing memory and computational costs.

Result: Sequential RC outperforms LSTM and standard RNNs with longer forecast horizons (15-25%), lower errors (20-30%), and significantly lower training costs (up to three orders of magnitude).

Conclusion: Sequential RC offers a scalable, efficient solution for high-dimensional forecasting, suitable for real-time scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional spatiotemporal systems remains computationally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models due to gradient-based training and memory bottlenecks. Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems. This approach provides a practical path toward real-time, energy-efficient forecasting in scientific and engineering applications.

*Zhuqi Miao,Sujan Ravi,Abdulaziz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML models using EHR data outperform FIB-4 in predicting liver cirrhosis 1-3 years before diagnosis, with AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve early prediction of liver cirrhosis by leveraging EHR data, surpassing traditional methods like FIB-4.

Method: Retrospective cohort study using EHR data; XGBoost models trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons, evaluated via AUC.

Result: ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4 across all prediction windows, showing improved early risk discrimination.

Conclusion: ML models enhance early cirrhosis prediction and can be integrated into clinical workflows for better patient management.

Abstract: Objective: Develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for predicting incident liver cirrhosis one, two, and three years prior to diagnosis using routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data, and to benchmark their performance against the FIB-4 score. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination. Conclusions: Machine learning models leveraging routine EHR data substantially outperform the traditional FIB-4 score for early prediction of liver cirrhosis. These models enable earlier and more accurate risk stratification and can be integrated into clinical workflows as automated decision-support tools to support proactive cirrhosis prevention and management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework improves semantic preservation in low-bandwidth systems using adaptive repetition coding, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of maintaining semantic meaning in communication systems with limited bandwidth.

Method: Introduced a reinforcement learning framework with adaptive repetition coding and a semantic distortion metric.

Result: Achieved 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that intelligently allocated repetition coding aligns with semantic granularity, suitable for edge computing and IoT.

Abstract: This paper tackles the pressing challenge of preserving semantic meaning in communication systems constrained by limited bandwidth. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity. This approach is particularly suited to edge computing and IoT scenarios, where bandwidth is scarce, but semantic fidelity is critical, providing a practical pathway for next-generation semantic-aware networks.

TL;DR: SSI-GAN, a semi-supervised GAN with a Swin-inspired discriminator and transformer-based generator, achieves high accuracy in classifying mosquito neuronal spike patterns with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual classification of mosquito neuronal spike patterns is labor-intensive, and existing deep learning solutions require extensive labeled data and preprocessing, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Proposes SSI-GAN, combining a transformer-based generator and Swin-inspired discriminator, optimized with Bayesian Optuna, trained on 15M+ spike samples with 1-3% labeled data.

Result: Achieved 99.93% accuracy with 3% labeled data, maintained high accuracy with 1% supervision, reducing manual labeling effort by 97-99% compared to supervised methods.

Conclusion: SSI-GAN outperforms baselines, demonstrating feasibility for mass adoption in mosquito-borne disease detection with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Mosquitos are the main transmissive agents of arboviral diseases. Manual classification of their neuronal spike patterns is very labor-intensive and expensive. Most available deep learning solutions require fully labeled spike datasets and highly preprocessed neuronal signals. This reduces the feasibility of mass adoption in actual field scenarios. To address the scarcity of labeled data problems, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that we call the Semi-supervised Swin-Inspired GAN (SSI-GAN). The Swin-inspired, shifted-window discriminator, together with a transformer-based generator, is used to classify neuronal spike trains and, consequently, detect viral neurotropism. We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level. The shifted-window transformer design proposed here beat all baselines by a wide margin and set new best marks in spike-based neuronal infection classification.

*Moirangthem Tiken Singh,Manibhushan Yaikhom*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a resource-efficient, data-centric framework for arrhythmia detection using hybrid wavelet-graph features and lightweight classifiers, achieving high accuracy and low computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases, especially arrhythmias, require continuous monitoring, but existing deep learning methods are too computationally intensive for edge devices.

Method: The framework integrates time-frequency wavelet decompositions with graph-theoretic descriptors (e.g., PageRank) and refines features using mutual information and recursive elimination, enabling lightweight linear classifiers.

Result: The system achieves 98.44% accuracy, an 8.54 KB model size, and 0.46 μs inference latency, outperforming compressed models like KD-Light.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves efficiency and accuracy, making it suitable for battery-less cardiac sensors.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases, particularly arrhythmias, remain a leading global cause of mortality, necessitating continuous monitoring via the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). However, state-of-the-art deep learning approaches often impose prohibitive computational overheads, rendering them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. This study proposes a resource-efficient, data-centric framework that prioritizes feature engineering over complexity. Our optimized pipeline makes the complex, high-dimensional arrhythmia data linearly separable. This is achieved by integrating time-frequency wavelet decompositions with graph-theoretic structural descriptors, such as PageRank centrality. This hybrid feature space, combining wavelet decompositions and graph-theoretic descriptors, is then refined using mutual information and recursive elimination, enabling interpretable, ultra-lightweight linear classifiers. Validation on the MIT-BIH and INCART datasets yields 98.44% diagnostic accuracy with an 8.54 KB model footprint. The system achieves 0.46 $μ$s classification inference latency within a 52 ms per-beat pipeline, ensuring real-time operation. These outcomes provide an order-of-magnitude efficiency gain over compressed models, such as KD-Light (25 KB, 96.32% accuracy), advancing battery-less cardiac sensors.

*Ellie Thieu,Jifan Zhang,Haoyue Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to identify images from specific generative models, improving attribution accuracy by using unlabeled internet data alongside labeled examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With photorealistic generative models advancing, there's a need to attribute synthetic content to specific models rather than just detecting real vs. fake.

Method: Uses CLIP features and a linear classifier for baseline attribution, then introduces constrained optimization leveraging unlabeled wild data to improve generalization to unseen generators.

Result: Incorporating wild data significantly boosts attribution performance on challenging unseen generators.

Conclusion: Unlabeled internet data can effectively enhance AI-generated content attribution in open-world scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of photorealistic generative models has made it increasingly important to attribute the origin of synthetic content, moving beyond binary real or fake detection toward identifying the specific model that produced a given image. We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high. Experimental results show that incorporating wild data substantially improves attribution performance on challenging unseen generators, demonstrating that unlabeled data from the wild can be effectively exploited to enhance AI generated content attribution in open world settings.

TL;DR: AGP integrates adversarial learning into graph prompting for robust GNN fine-tuning, addressing vulnerabilities to noise in topology and node attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods for GNNs are vulnerable to noise and attacks on graph topology and node features, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: AGP formulates a min-max optimization problem, uses JointPGD for adversarial noise generation, and learns optimal node prompts to counteract noise.

Result: AGP demonstrates theoretical and empirical robustness against graph topology and node noise, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AGP is a versatile, generalizable framework that enhances the robustness of pre-trained GNNs in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method has emerged as a dominant paradigm for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods usually exhibit significant vulnerability to various noise and attacks on graph topology and node attributes/features. To address this issue, for the first time, we propose integrating adversarial learning into graph prompting and develop a novel Adversarial Graph Prompting (AGP) framework to achieve robust graph fine-tuning. Our AGP has two key aspects. First, we propose the general problem formulation of AGP as a min-max optimization problem and develop an alternating optimization scheme to solve it. For inner maximization, we propose Joint Projected Gradient Descent (JointPGD) algorithm to generate strong adversarial noise. For outer minimization, we employ a simple yet effective module to learn the optimal node prompts to counteract the adversarial noise. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed AGP can theoretically address both graph topology and node noise. This confirms the versatility and robustness of our AGP fine-tuning method across various graph noise. Note that, the proposed AGP is a general method that can be integrated with various pre-trained GNN models to enhance their robustness on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark tasks validate the robustness and effectiveness of AGP method compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRIT introduces a dynamic, curvature-aware LoRA procedure for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, outperforming LoRA and QLoRA by reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like LoRA and QLoRA ignore local loss curvature, leading to inefficient updates and drift. GRIT aims to address these limitations.

Method: GRIT uses K-FAC preconditioned gradients, periodic reprojection onto Fisher eigendirections, and adaptive rank selection.

Result: GRIT matches or surpasses LoRA and QLoRA performance while reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average.

Conclusion: GRIT offers a more efficient and effective alternative to existing PEFT methods, minimizing drift and optimizing parameter usage.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is the default way to adapt LLMs, but widely used LoRA and QLoRA are largely geometry-agnostic: they optimize in fixed, randomly oriented low-rank subspaces with first-order descent, mostly ignoring local loss curvature. This can inflate the effective update budget and amplify drift along weakly constrained directions. We introduce GRIT, a dynamic, curvature-aware LoRA procedure that preserves the LoRA parameterization but: (1) preconditions gradients in rank space using K-FAC as a natural-gradient proxy; (2) periodically reprojects the low-rank basis onto dominant Fisher eigendirections to suppress drift; and (3) adapts the effective rank from the spectrum so capacity concentrates where signal resides. Across instruction-following, comprehension, and reasoning benchmarks on LLaMA backbones, GRIT matches or surpasses LoRA and QLoRA while reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average (25--80% across tasks), without practical quality loss across prompt styles and data mixes. To model forgetting, we fit a curvature-modulated power law. Empirically, GRIT yields lower drift and a better updates-vs-retention frontier than strong PEFT-optimizer baselines (Orthogonal-LoRA, IA3, DoRA, Eff-FT, Shampoo).

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theory explaining how supervised learning in wide L2-regularized networks inherently compresses data, contrasting it with expansive self-supervised learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the compressive nature of feature learning in supervised settings and how it differs from self-supervised approaches, which tend to be more expansive.

Method: The authors derive a kernel ordinary differential equation (ODE) to predict spectral evolution and analyze the rank of the kernel and SGD noise, bounding it by the number of classes.

Result: They show that supervised learning confines dynamics to a low-rank task-relevant subspace ($O(C)$), contrasting with the high-rank representations in self-supervision.

Conclusion: The framework bridges deterministic and stochastic views of alignment, highlighting the inherent compression in supervised learning compared to self-supervised methods.

Abstract: We present a theory of feature learning in wide L2-regularized networks showing that supervised learning is inherently compressive. We derive a kernel ODE that predicts a "water-filling" spectral evolution and prove that for any stable steady state, the kernel rank is bounded by the number of classes ($C$). We further demonstrate that SGD noise is similarly low-rank ($O(C)$), confining dynamics to the task-relevant subspace. This framework unifies the deterministic and stochastic views of alignment and contrasts the low-rank nature of supervised learning with the high-rank, expansive representations of self-supervision.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a federated IRL method using optimal transport to efficiently and privately share reward functions across heterogeneous agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like differing dynamics, privacy constraints, and limited bandwidth in pooling data for shared reward learning in multi-agent systems.

Method: Each agent performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, followed by fusing rewards via Wasserstein barycenter.

Result: The barycentric fusion provides a more accurate global reward estimate than traditional federated averaging methods.

Conclusion: The framework offers a communication-efficient and principled solution for shared reward learning across diverse agents.

Abstract: In robotics and multi-agent systems, fleets of autonomous agents often operate in subtly different environments while pursuing a common high-level objective. Directly pooling their data to learn a shared reward function is typically impractical due to differences in dynamics, privacy constraints, and limited communication bandwidth. This paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach to federated inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each client first performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, adhering to its computational and privacy limitations. The resulting reward functions are then fused via a Wasserstein barycenter, which considers their underlying geometric structure. We further prove that this barycentric fusion yields a more faithful global reward estimate than conventional parameter averaging methods in federated learning. Overall, this work provides a principled and communication-efficient framework for deriving a shared reward that generalizes across heterogeneous agents and environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantum King-Ring Domination (QKRD), a structured benchmark for evaluating QAOA's performance on real-world problems, replacing random instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack semantic structure and interpretability, limiting insights into QAOA's performance on meaningful real-world problems.

Method: Derived from chess tactical positions, QKRD provides 5,000 structured instances with human-interpretable metrics and intrinsic validation.

Result: QAOA with constraint-preserving mixers converges faster, warm-start reduces steps, and CVaR yields negative results.

Conclusion: Structured benchmarks reveal QAOA's advantages obscured in random instances, outperforming classical heuristics.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is extensively benchmarked on synthetic random instances such as MaxCut, TSP, and SAT problems, but these lack semantic structure and human interpretability, offering limited insight into performance on real-world problems with meaningful constraints. We introduce Quantum King-Ring Domination (QKRD), a NISQ-scale benchmark derived from chess tactical positions that provides 5,000 structured instances with one-hot constraints, spatial locality, and 10--40 qubit scale. The benchmark pairs human-interpretable coverage metrics with intrinsic validation against classical heuristics, enabling algorithmic conclusions without external oracles. Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p<10^{-7}, d\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p<10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p<10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit. Intrinsic validation shows QAOA outperforms greedy heuristics by 12.6\% and random selection by 80.1\%. Our results demonstrate that structured benchmarks reveal advantages of problem-informed QAOA techniques obscured in random instances. We release all code, data, and experimental artifacts for reproducible NISQ algorithm research.

TL;DR: The paper proposes automatic feature learning methods combining optical flow and three deep models for human detection in videos from aerial platforms, achieving high accuracy on a challenging dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human detection methods rely on handcrafted features, which are task-specific and sensitive to dynamic conditions. Automatic feature learning offers cheaper, adaptable solutions without expert input.

Method: The study combines optical flow with three deep learning models (S-CNN, pretrained CNN, H-ELM) for human detection in aerial videos, tested on the UCF-ARG dataset.

Result: Pretrained CNN achieved 98.09% accuracy, S-CNN 95.6% (softmax) and 91.7% (SVM), and H-ELM 95.9%. Training times varied, with H-ELM taking 445s (CPU) and S-CNN 770s (GPU).

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively detect humans in aerial videos, with pretrained CNN performing best. The approach is adaptable and suitable for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Human detection in videos plays an important role in various real-life applications. Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%. Using a normal Central Processing Unit (CPU), H-ELM's training time takes 445 seconds. Learning in S-CNN takes 770 seconds with a high-performance Graphical Processing Unit (GPU).

TL;DR: Deep Delta Learning (DDL) generalizes residual networks by introducing a learnable Delta Operator to modulate identity shortcuts, enabling dynamic spectrum control and modeling of complex transitions while maintaining stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard residual networks' additive inductive bias limits their ability to model complex state transitions, prompting the need for a more flexible mechanism.

Method: DDL introduces a Delta Operator, a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by reflection direction and gating scalar, enabling dynamic interpolation between identity mapping and other transformations.

Result: Spectral analysis shows DDL dynamically controls layer-wise transitions, allowing non-monotonic dynamics without sacrificing training stability.

Conclusion: DDL enhances residual networks' flexibility and capacity for complex feature transformations while preserving their stable training properties.

Abstract: The efficacy of deep residual networks is fundamentally predicated on the identity shortcut connection. While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the network's capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $β(\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $β(\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures.

TL;DR: E-GRPO enhances reinforcement learning for flow matching by optimizing entropy-aware SDE sampling steps to improve exploration and reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from sparse and ambiguous rewards due to multiple denoising steps, while high entropy steps offer better exploration.

Method: Proposes E-GRPO, merging low entropy steps into high entropy steps for SDE sampling and using ODE sampling elsewhere, with multi-step group normalized advantage.

Result: Shows effectiveness in improving exploration and reward signals across different settings.

Conclusion: E-GRPO successfully addresses ambiguity in reward signals and enhances exploration efficiency.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning has enhanced the flow matching models on human preference alignment. While stochastic sampling enables the exploration of denoising directions, existing methods which optimize over multiple denoising steps suffer from sparse and ambiguous reward signals. We observe that the high entropy steps enable more efficient and effective exploration while the low entropy steps result in undistinguished roll-outs. To this end, we propose E-GRPO, an entropy aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to increase the entropy of SDE sampling steps. Since the integration of stochastic differential equations suffer from ambiguous reward signals due to stochasticity from multiple steps, we specifically merge consecutive low entropy steps to formulate one high entropy step for SDE sampling, while applying ODE sampling on other steps. Building upon this, we introduce multi-step group normalized advantage, which computes group-relative advantages within samples sharing the same consolidated SDE denoising step. Experimental results on different reward settings have demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.

TL;DR: A large-scale evaluation compares 16 interpretable ML methods for tabular data, revealing performance hierarchies and context-dependent strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gaps in systematic evaluations of interpretable ML models for tabular data amidst rising concerns over model accountability.

Method: Comparative study of 16 interpretable methods across 216 datasets, analyzing performance by structural characteristics and robustness.

Result: EBMs excel in regression; SR and IGANNs in non-linear settings; GOSDTs are sensitive to class imbalance.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance for balancing interpretability and performance in ML models for tabular data.

Abstract: In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has seen widespread adoption across a broad range of sectors, including high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. This growing reliance has raised increasing concerns regarding model interpretability and accountability, particularly as legal and regulatory frameworks place tighter constraints on using black-box models in critical applications. Although interpretable ML has attracted substantial attention, systematic evaluations of inherently interpretable models, especially for tabular data, remain relatively scarce and often focus primarily on aggregated performance outcomes.
  To address this gap, we present a large-scale comparative evaluation of 16 inherently interpretable methods, ranging from classical linear models and decision trees to more recent approaches such as Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), Symbolic Regression (SR), and Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees (GOSDT). Our study spans 216 real-world tabular datasets and goes beyond aggregate rankings by stratifying performance according to structural dataset characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, linearity, and class imbalance. In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data.

### [123] [A Comparative Study of Adaptation Strategies for Time Series Foundation Models in Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00446)
*Miseon Park,Kijung Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on large datasets outperform task-specific baselines in anomaly detection, especially in class imbalance scenarios, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if TSFMs can serve as universal backbones for anomaly detection without extensive task-specific training, given their pretraining on large heterogeneous data.

Method: Systematic experiments comparing zero-shot inference, full model adaptation, and PEFT strategies (e.g., LoRA, OFT, HRA) across multiple benchmarks.

Result: TSFMs outperform task-specific baselines, achieving higher AUC-PR and VUS-PR, particularly under severe class imbalance. PEFT methods reduce costs and often match or surpass full fine-tuning performance.

Conclusion: TSFMs are promising general-purpose models for scalable and efficient time series anomaly detection, with PEFT enabling efficient adaptation.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is essential for the reliable operation of complex systems, but most existing methods require extensive task-specific training. We explore whether time series foundation models (TSFMs), pretrained on large heterogeneous data, can serve as universal backbones for anomaly detection. Through systematic experiments across multiple benchmarks, we compare zero-shot inference, full model adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. Our results demonstrate that TSFMs outperform task-specific baselines, achieving notable gains in AUC-PR and VUS-PR, particularly under severe class imbalance. Moreover, PEFT methods such as LoRA, OFT, and HRA not only reduce computational cost but also match or surpass full fine-tuning in most cases, indicating that TSFMs can be efficiently adapted for anomaly detection, even when pretrained for forecasting. These findings position TSFMs as promising general-purpose models for scalable and efficient time series anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs) to address the challenge of editing CBMs efficiently without retraining, supporting concept-label, concept, and data-level edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs lack adaptability in dynamic real-world scenarios where data and concepts evolve, requiring efficient editing methods.

Method: CCBMs use mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations from influence functions to enable granular editing (concept-label, concept, data-level).

Result: Experiments show CCBMs are efficient and adaptable, enhancing dynamic and trustworthy CBMs.

Conclusion: CCBMs provide a practical solution for maintaining CBMs in evolving environments without retraining.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered much attention for their ability to elucidate the prediction process through a human-understandable concept layer. However, most previous studies focused on static scenarios where the data and concepts are assumed to be fixed and clean. In real-world applications, deployed models require continuous maintenance: we often need to remove erroneous or sensitive data (unlearning), correct mislabeled concepts, or incorporate newly acquired samples (incremental learning) to adapt to evolving environments. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs). Specifically, CCBMs support three granularities of model editing: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level, the latter of which encompasses both data removal and data addition. CCBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our CCBMs, affirming their practical value in enabling dynamic and trustworthy CBMs.

*Yongtao Qu,Shangzhe Li,Weitong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding method, improves offline imitation learning by leveraging diffusion models to create dense rewards from imperfect data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline imitation learning methods struggle with scarce expert data and suboptimal offline data due to rigid support constraints and reliance on brittle models.

Method: TGE constructs dense surrogate rewards by estimating expert state density in a diffusion model's latent space, capturing long-horizon dynamics and bridging data gaps.

Result: TGE matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods on D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: TGE effectively addresses challenges in offline LfO by using diffusion embeddings, ensuring robust learning signals even with imperfect data.

Abstract: We consider the offline imitation learning from observations (LfO) where the expert demonstrations are scarce and the available offline suboptimal data are far from the expert behavior. Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.

### [126] [Deep Networks Learn Deep Hierarchical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00455)
*Amit Daniely*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Layerwise SGD on residual networks efficiently learns hierarchical label models, surpassing previous learnable models by reaching the depth limit of efficient learnability. The paper suggests hierarchical models could explain deep learning success, supported by human teachers providing granular labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand why deep learning excels by identifying hierarchical label structures as a key factor, with human teachers naturally revealing such hierarchies through granular labels.

Method: Layerwise stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on residual networks is applied to learn hierarchical label models, formalizing the role of teachers in revealing internal algorithms.

Result: The class of hierarchical models surpasses previous learnable models, reaching polynomial-depth expressivity where log-depth circuits sufficed before. Teachers' granular labels facilitate efficient learnability.

Conclusion: Hierarchical models may underlie deep learning's success, with teachers' hints naturally exposing these structures, enabling efficient learning.

Abstract: We consider supervised learning with $n$ labels and show that layerwise SGD on residual networks can efficiently learn a class of hierarchical models. This model class assumes the existence of an (unknown) label hierarchy $L_1 \subseteq L_2 \subseteq \dots \subseteq L_r = [n]$, where labels in $L_1$ are simple functions of the input, while for $i > 1$, labels in $L_i$ are simple functions of simpler labels.
  Our class surpasses models that were previously shown to be learnable by deep learning algorithms, in the sense that it reaches the depth limit of efficient learnability. That is, there are models in this class that require polynomial depth to express, whereas previous models can be computed by log-depth circuits.
  Furthermore, we suggest that learnability of such hierarchical models might eventually form a basis for understanding deep learning. Beyond their natural fit for domains where deep learning excels, we argue that the mere existence of human ``teachers" supports the hypothesis that hierarchical structures are inherently available. By providing granular labels, teachers effectively reveal ``hints'' or ``snippets'' of the internal algorithms used by the brain. We formalize this intuition, showing that in a simplified model where a teacher is partially aware of their internal logic, a hierarchical structure emerges that facilitates efficient learnability.

### [127] [Geometric Regularization in Mixture-of-Experts: The Disconnect Between Weights and Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00457)
*Hyunjun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Orthogonality loss fails to enforce expert diversity in MoE models, increasing weight-space overlap and showing inconsistent performance effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of geometric regularization in expert specialization within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models.

Method: Applied orthogonality loss to enforce expert diversity and analyzed its effects across 7 regularization strengths.

Result: Orthogonality loss increased weight-space overlap, left activation-space overlap high (~0.6), and yielded inconsistent performance improvements or degradations. No significant correlation between weight and activation orthogonality was found.

Conclusion: Weight-space regularization neither achieves geometric diversity nor reliably improves performance, making it unsuitable for MoE models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficiency through sparse activation, but the role of geometric regularization in expert specialization remains unclear. We apply orthogonality loss to enforce expert diversity and find it fails on multiple fronts: it does not reduce weight-space overlap (MSO actually increases by up to 114%), activation-space overlap remains high (~0.6) regardless of regularization, and effects on performance are inconsistent -- marginal improvement on WikiText-103 (-0.9%), slight degradation on TinyStories (+0.9%), and highly variable results on PTB (std > 1.0). Our analysis across 7 regularization strengths reveals no significant correlation (r = -0.293, p = 0.523) between weight and activation orthogonality. These findings demonstrate that weight-space regularization neither achieves its geometric goal nor reliably improves performance, making it unsuitable for MoE diversity.

### [128] [Detecting Spike Wave Discharges (SWD) using 1-dimensional Residual UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00459)
*Saurav Sengupta,Scott Kilianski,Suchetha Sharma,Sakina Lashkeri,Ashley McHugh,Mark Beenhakker,Donald E. Brown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces AugUNet1D, an improved 1D UNet model for automatic labeling of spike wave discharges (SWDs) in EEG recordings, outperforming traditional methods like Twin Peaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling of SWDs in EEG is labor-intensive. Automated methods can reduce workload, and existing machine learning approaches need improvement.

Method: The study compares 14 ML classifiers on a dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings, selects the best-performing 1D UNet, and enhances it with data augmentation (AugUNet1D). Performance is compared against Twin Peaks.

Result: AugUNet1D outperforms Twin Peaks, detecting SWDs more accurately and resembling manual labels better. Data augmentation, especially scaling, significantly improves performance.

Conclusion: AugUNet1D is a superior automated tool for SWD labeling in EEG, made publicly available for broader use.

Abstract: The manual labeling of events in electroencephalography (EEG) records is time-consuming. This is especially true when EEG recordings are taken continuously over weeks to months. Therefore, a method to automatically label pertinent EEG events reduces the manual workload. Spike wave discharges (SWD), which are the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, are EEG events that are often labeled manually. While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved. Here we compare the performance of 14 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs. We find that a 1D UNet performs best for labeling SWDs in this dataset. We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied. We then compare the 1D UNet with data augmentation, AugUNet1D, against a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called "Twin Peaks". AugUNet1D showed superior performance and detected events with more similar features to the SWDs labeled manually. AugUNet1D, pretrained on our manually annotated data or untrained, is made public for others users.

### [129] [Laplacian Kernelized Bandit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00461)
*Shuang Wu,Arash A. Amini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for multi-user contextual bandits with graph-related users and non-linear rewards, combining graph smoothness and individual roughness penalties into a single multi-user RKHS. New algorithms leverage this framework for efficient exploration with strong regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address multi-user contextual bandits where users are interconnected by a graph and exhibit non-linear reward functions with graph homophily, the authors aim to unify graph-structured learning and kernelized bandits for structured exploration.

Method: The authors introduce a joint penalty combining graph smoothness (based on RKHS distances) and individual roughness penalties, proving its equivalence to a unified multi-user RKHS. They derive its reproducing kernel, fuse the graph Laplacian with the base arm kernel, and design algorithms (	exttt{LK-GP-UCB} and 	exttt{LK-GP-TS}) using Gaussian Process posteriors.

Result: Theoretical regret bounds scale with the effective dimension of the multi-user kernel, avoiding dependencies on user count or ambient dimension. Empirical results show the methods outperform linear and non-graph-aware baselines in non-linear settings and remain competitive for linear rewards.

Conclusion: The work provides a unified, theoretically grounded, and practical framework bridging Laplacian regularization with kernelized bandits, enabling structured exploration in multi-user settings.

Abstract: We study multi-user contextual bandits where users are related by a graph and their reward functions exhibit both non-linear behavior and graph homophily. We introduce a principled joint penalty for the collection of user reward functions $\{f_u\}$, combining a graph smoothness term based on RKHS distances with an individual roughness penalty. Our central contribution is proving that this penalty is equivalent to the squared norm within a single, unified \emph{multi-user RKHS}. We explicitly derive its reproducing kernel, which elegantly fuses the graph Laplacian with the base arm kernel. This unification allows us to reframe the problem as learning a single ''lifted'' function, enabling the design of principled algorithms, \texttt{LK-GP-UCB} and \texttt{LK-GP-TS}, that leverage Gaussian Process posteriors over this new kernel for exploration. We provide high-probability regret bounds that scale with an \emph{effective dimension} of the multi-user kernel, replacing dependencies on user count or ambient dimension. Empirically, our methods outperform strong linear and non-graph-aware baselines in non-linear settings and remain competitive even when the true rewards are linear. Our work delivers a unified, theoretically grounded, and practical framework that bridges Laplacian regularization with kernelized bandits for structured exploration.

### [130] [Neural Chains and Discrete Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00473)
*Sauro Succi,Abhisek Ganguly,Santosh Ansumali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares neural chains (ML without self-attention) and numerical discretization methods for solving PDEs, finding similar results but differing in efficiency and transparency. PINNs use more parameters and lack explainability compared to finite-difference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the analogy between ML (specifically neural chains) and dynamical systems modeled by PDEs, comparing their effectiveness and interpretability.

Method: The authors compare numerical solutions of Burgers and Eikonal equations using standard discretization (neural chains) and PINN learning, analyzing their matrix structures and computational costs.

Result: Both methods yield similar knowledge about system dynamics, but PINNs rely on random matrices, requiring more parameters and lacking transparency compared to structured finite-difference matrices.

Conclusion: While PINNs are less efficient and explainable for 1D problems, they might still be viable for high-dimensional cases, leaving room for further research.

Abstract: We inspect the analogy between machine-learning (ML) applications based on the transformer architecture without self-attention, {\it neural chains} hereafter, and discrete dynamical systems associated with discretised versions of neural integral and partial differential equations (NIE, PDE). A comparative analysis of the numerical solution of the (viscid and inviscid) Burgers and Eikonal equations via standard numerical discretization (also cast in terms of neural chains) and via PINN's learning is presented and commented on. It is found that standard numerical discretization and PINN learning provide two different paths to acquire essentially the same knowledge about the dynamics of the system. PINN learning proceeds through random matrices which bear no direct relation to the highly structured matrices associated with finite-difference (FD) procedures. Random matrices leading to acceptable solutions are far more numerous than the unique tridiagonal form in matrix space, which explains why the PINN search typically lands on the random ensemble. The price is a much larger number of parameters, causing lack of physical transparency (explainability) as well as large training costs with no counterpart in the FD procedure. However, our results refer to one-dimensional dynamic problems, hence they don't rule out the possibility that PINNs and ML in general, may offer better strategies for high-dimensional problems.

### [131] [When Small Models Are Right for Wrong Reasons: Process Verification for Trustworthy Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00513)
*Laksh Advani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Small language models often provide correct answers with flawed reasoning, a 'Right-for-Wrong-Reasons' issue missed by standard metrics. A new metric, Reasoning Integrity Score (RIS), is introduced to address this. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves reasoning, meta-cognitive interventions can harm performance in small models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure trust in autonomous agents powered by small language models (7-9B parameters), it's critical to evaluate their reasoning integrity, not just output accuracy, due to the prevalence of flawed reasoning even in correct answers.

Method: Analysis of 10,734 reasoning traces across three models and diverse tasks led to the introduction of the Reasoning Integrity Score (RIS). Interventions like RAG and meta-cognitive strategies (e.g., self-critique) were tested. A neural classifier was also developed for verification.

Result: RAG improved reasoning integrity (Cohen's d=0.23–0.93), reducing errors by 7.6%, while meta-cognitive interventions degraded performance (d=-0.14 to -0.33). A neural classifier achieved 0.86 F1-score with 100× speedup for verification.

Conclusion: Process-based verification (e.g., RIS) is essential for trustworthy agents, as accuracy alone is insufficient when models are 'right for wrong reasons.' RAG is effective, but meta-cognitive interventions may backfire in small models.

Abstract: Deploying small language models (7-9B parameters) as autonomous agents requires trust in their reasoning, not just their outputs. We reveal a critical reliability crisis: 50-69\% of correct answers from these models contain fundamentally flawed reasoning -- a ``Right-for-Wrong-Reasons'' phenomenon invisible to standard accuracy metrics. Through analysis of 10,734 reasoning traces across three models and diverse tasks, we introduce the Reasoning Integrity Score (RIS), a process-based metric validated with substantial inter-rater agreement ($κ=0.657$). Conventional practices are challenged by our findings: while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) significantly improves reasoning integrity (Cohen's $d=0.23$--$0.93$), meta-cognitive interventions like self-critique often harm performance ($d=-0.14$ to $-0.33$) in small models on the evaluated tasks. Mechanistic analysis reveals RAG succeeds by grounding calculations in external evidence, reducing errors by 7.6\%, while meta-cognition amplifies confusion without sufficient model capacity. To enable deployment, verification capabilities are distilled into a neural classifier achieving 0.86 F1-score with 100$\times$ speedup. These results underscore the necessity of process-based verification for trustworthy agents: accuracy alone is dangerously insufficient when models can be right for entirely wrong reasons.

### [132] [Trajectory Guard -- A Lightweight, Sequence-Aware Model for Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00516)
*Laksh Advani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Trajectory Guard, a hybrid Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder, improves anomaly detection in LLM agents' action plans by combining contrastive learning and reconstruction for better accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods struggle with contextual misalignment and structural incoherence in multi-step action plans generated by LLM agents, leading to low F1-scores.

Method: Trajectory Guard uses a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function to jointly learn task-trajectory alignment (contrastive learning) and sequential validity (reconstruction).

Result: Achieves F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced benchmarks, with inference latency of 32 ms (17-27× faster than baselines).

Conclusion: The proposed method enables real-time safety verification by addressing both contextual and structural anomalies in LLM agents' plans with higher accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous LLM agents generate multi-step action plans that can fail due to contextual misalignment or structural incoherence. Existing anomaly detection methods are ill-suited for this challenge: mean-pooling embeddings dilutes anomalous steps, while contrastive-only approaches ignore sequential structure. Standard unsupervised methods on pre-trained embeddings achieve F1-scores no higher than 0.69. We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both "wrong plan for this task" and "malformed plan structure." On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\&When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks. At 32 ms inference latency, our approach runs 17-27$\times$ faster than LLM Judge baselines, enabling real-time safety verification in production deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAFN, an interpretable deep learning framework for integrating multimodal data to improve Parkinson's disease profiling, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with interpretability, class imbalance, and effective fusion of multimodal data for Parkinson's disease profiling.

Method: SAFN uses modality-specific encoders and symmetric cross-attention to fuse MRI and clinical data, with sparsity-constrained attention and class-balanced loss.

Result: SAFN achieves 0.98 accuracy and 1.00 PR-AUC, outperforming baselines, with 60% predictive weight on clinical assessments.

Conclusion: SAFN offers a transparent, reproducible multimodal framework for neurodegenerative disease profiling.

Abstract: Characterising the heterogeneous presentation of Parkinson's disease (PD) requires integrating biological and clinical markers within a unified predictive framework. While multimodal data provide complementary information, many existing computational models struggle with interpretability, class imbalance, or effective fusion of high-dimensional imaging and tabular clinical features. To address these limitations, we propose the Class-Weighted Sparse-Attention Fusion Network (SAFN), an interpretable deep learning framework for robust multimodal profiling. SAFN integrates MRI cortical thickness, MRI volumetric measures, clinical assessments, and demographic variables using modality-specific encoders and a symmetric cross-attention mechanism that captures nonlinear interactions between imaging and clinical representations. A sparsity-constrained attention-gating fusion layer dynamically prioritises informative modalities, while a class-balanced focal loss (beta = 0.999, gamma = 1.5) mitigates dataset imbalance without synthetic oversampling. Evaluated on 703 participants (570 PD, 133 healthy controls) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation, SAFN achieves an accuracy of 0.98 plus or minus 0.02 and a PR-AUC of 1.00 plus or minus 0.00, outperforming established machine learning and deep learning baselines. Interpretability analysis shows a clinically coherent decision process, with approximately 60 percent of predictive weight assigned to clinical assessments, consistent with Movement Disorder Society diagnostic principles. SAFN provides a reproducible and transparent multimodal modelling paradigm for computational profiling of neurodegenerative disease.

TL;DR: Compressing LSTM models by reducing hidden units maintains accuracy while reducing computational demands and improving performance for retail sales forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mid to small retail industries face challenges with the computational power required for standard LSTM models, prompting exploration of model compression techniques.

Method: Gradually reduced hidden units from 128 to 16 using the Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting dataset, analyzing model size vs. prediction accuracy.

Result: A 64-unit model achieved better accuracy (MAPE 12.4%) than the full 128-unit model (MAPE 23.6%), with a 73% size reduction and 47% accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: Larger models aren't always better; optimized LSTMs balance accuracy and computational efficiency for retail sales forecasting.

Abstract: Standard LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks provide accurate predictions for sales data in the retail industry, but require a lot of computing power. It can be challenging especially for mid to small retail industries. This paper examines LSTM model compression by gradually reducing the number of hidden units from 128 to 16. We used the Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting dataset, which has 913,000 daily sales records from 10 stores and 50 items, to look at the trade-off between model size and how accurate the predictions are. Experiments show that lowering the number of hidden LSTM units to 64 maintains the same level of accuracy while also improving it. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranges from 23.6% for the full 128-unit model to 12.4% for the 64-unit model. The optimized model is 73% smaller (from 280KB to 76KB) and 47% more accurate. These results show that larger models do not always achieve better results.

Method: Reviewing customization techniques (e.g., fine-tuning, prompt engineering) and proposing federated implementations, with experimental validation of federated prefix-tuning.

Result: Experiments show federated prefix-tuning is feasible, performs close to centralized methods, and outperforms other federated customization techniques in efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: Federated prefix-tuning is a viable and competitive method for customizing large models in federated learning, demonstrating strong performance and robustness.

Abstract: In this article, we explore federated customization of large models and highlight the key challenges it poses within the federated learning framework. We review several popular large model customization techniques, including full fine-tuning, efficient fine-tuning, prompt engineering, prefix-tuning, knowledge distillation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Then, we discuss how these techniques can be implemented within the federated learning framework. Moreover, we conduct experiments on federated prefix-tuning, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first trial to apply prefix-tuning in the federated learning setting. The conducted experiments validate its feasibility with performance close to centralized approaches. Further comparison with three other federated customization methods demonstrated its competitive performance, satisfactory efficiency, and consistent robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional planogram creation is time-consuming and costly, requiring significant manual effort. This paper aims to automate and optimize the process using generative AI.

Method: A cloud-native architecture combines AWS-based model training with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model incorporates retail-specific constraints via a modified loss function.

Result: The system reduces planogram design time from 30 to 0.5 hours (98.3% reduction) and achieves 94.4% constraint satisfaction. Economic benefits include a 97.5% cost reduction and a 4.4-month break-even period.

Conclusion: Generative AI, specifically diffusion models, is viable for automating retail space optimization, offering significant time and cost savings while maintaining high constraint satisfaction.

Abstract: Planogram creation is a significant challenge for retail, requiring an average of 30 hours per complex layout. This paper introduces a cloud-native architecture using diffusion models to automatically generate store-specific planograms. Unlike conventional optimization methods that reorganize existing layouts, our system learns from successful shelf arrangements across multiple retail locations to create new planogram configurations. The architecture combines cloud-based model training via AWS with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model integrates retail-specific constraints through a modified loss function. Simulation-based analysis demonstrates the system reduces planogram design time by 98.3% (from 30 to 0.5 hours) while achieving 94.4% constraint satisfaction. Economic analysis reveals a 97.5% reduction in creation expenses with a 4.4-month break-even period. The cloud-native architecture scales linearly, supporting up to 10,000 concurrent store requests. This work demonstrates the viability of generative AI for automated retail space optimization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an entropy-based retraining framework for machine learning models in nonstationary environments, reducing retraining frequency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in machine learning models due to data drift, providing a principled approach to balance retraining frequency and operational cost.

Method: Model data drift using a Fokker-Planck equation, quantify model-data mismatch with time-evolving Kullback-Leibler divergence, and introduce entropy-triggered retraining based on entropy production.

Result: Entropy-triggered retraining matches predictive performance of high-frequency retraining while reducing retraining events significantly compared to daily or label-based policies.

Conclusion: The entropy-based framework offers an effective, label-free strategy to manage data drift, optimizing retraining without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Machine learning models deployed in nonstationary environments experience performance degradation due to data drift. While many drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a principled dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining frequency should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy--based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics. Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse. In a controlled nonstationary classification experiment, entropy--triggered retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to high--frequency retraining while reducing retraining events by an order of magnitude relative to daily and label--based policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new perspective on adversarial weaknesses in deep neural networks, differentiating between samples that exploit brittle features and those that don't, and proposes a metric to analyze these weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the oversight in existing theories of adversarial robustness, which ignore adversarial samples that don't exploit brittle but predictive features.

Method: Proposes an ensemble-based metric to measure manipulation of non-robust features and analyzes adversarial samples using this metric.

Result: Identifies two types of adversarial weaknesses and re-examines phenomena like sharpness-aware minimization's impact and the robustness gap.

Conclusion: Differentiating adversarial weaknesses provides deeper insights into robustness, enabling better evaluation and understanding of adversarial threats.

Abstract: Over the past decade, numerous theories have been proposed to explain the widespread vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial evasion attacks. Among these, the theory of non-robust features proposed by Ilyas et al. has been widely accepted, showing that brittle but predictive features of the data distribution can be directly exploited by attackers. However, this theory overlooks adversarial samples that do not directly utilize these features. In this work, we advocate that these two kinds of samples - those which use use brittle but predictive features and those that do not - comprise two types of adversarial weaknesses and should be differentiated when evaluating adversarial robustness. For this purpose, we propose an ensemble-based metric to measure the manipulation of non-robust features by adversarial perturbations and use this metric to analyze the makeup of adversarial samples generated by attackers. This new perspective also allows us to re-examine multiple phenomena, including the impact of sharpness-aware minimization on adversarial robustness and the robustness gap observed between adversarially training and standard training on robust datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TeleDoCTR is a domain-specific system for automating telecom ticket troubleshooting, improving efficiency and accuracy over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual telecom ticket troubleshooting is time-consuming and inefficient, requiring specialized knowledge and delaying issue resolution.

Method: TeleDoCTR integrates domain-specific ranking and generative models to classify tickets, retrieve similar historical tickets, and generate fault analysis reports.

Result: The system outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world telecom data, enhancing troubleshooting accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: TeleDoCTR effectively automates telecom ticket resolution, addressing key challenges and improving operational efficiency.

Abstract: Ticket troubleshooting refers to the process of analyzing and resolving problems that are reported through a ticketing system. In large organizations offering a wide range of services, this task is highly complex due to the diversity of submitted tickets and the need for specialized domain knowledge. In particular, troubleshooting in telecommunications (telecom) is a very time-consuming task as it requires experts to interpret ticket content, consult documentation, and search historical records to identify appropriate resolutions. This human-intensive approach not only delays issue resolution but also hinders overall operational efficiency. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of ticket troubleshooting in telecom, we propose TeleDoCTR, a novel telecom-related, domain-specific, and contextual troubleshooting system tailored for end-to-end ticket resolution in telecom. TeleDoCTR integrates both domain-specific ranking and generative models to automate key steps of the troubleshooting workflow which are: routing tickets to the appropriate expert team responsible for resolving the ticket (classification task), retrieving contextually and semantically similar historical tickets (retrieval task), and generating a detailed fault analysis report outlining the issue, root cause, and potential solutions (generation task). We evaluate TeleDoCTR on a real-world dataset from a telecom infrastructure and demonstrate that it achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the troubleshooting process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training methodologies lack mechanisms to ensure consistent and robust model performance across runs, leading to significant variability in accuracy even under controlled conditions.

Method: The authors propose CLF, a custom loss function that balances predictive accuracy with training stability by fine-tuning its parameters.

Result: Experiments across various architectures for image classification and time series forecasting show that CLF significantly enhances training robustness without compromising predictive performance.

Conclusion: CLF is an effective and efficient strategy for developing more stable, reliable, and trustworthy neural networks.

Abstract: To enhance the reproducibility and reliability of deep learning models, we address a critical gap in current training methodologies: the lack of mechanisms that ensure consistent and robust performance across runs. Our empirical analysis reveals that even under controlled initialization and training conditions, the accuracy of the model can exhibit significant variability. To address this issue, we propose a Custom Loss Function (CLF) that reduces the sensitivity of training outcomes to stochastic factors such as weight initialization and data shuffling. By fine-tuning its parameters, CLF explicitly balances predictive accuracy with training stability, leading to more consistent and reliable model performance. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures for both image classification and time series forecasting demonstrate that our approach significantly improves training robustness without sacrificing predictive performance. These results establish CLF as an effective and efficient strategy for developing more stable, reliable and trustworthy neural networks.

*Thomas Katraouras,Dimitrios Rafailidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MBC compresses the memory bank of LLMs using codebook optimization and prevents catastrophic forgetting, reducing memory size to 0.3% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from outdated knowledge and catastrophic forgetting when updated with new data. Memory-augmented approaches address this but face scalability issues.

Method: MBC compresses the memory bank via codebook optimization during online learning, uses an online resetting mechanism to prevent collapse, and employs Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation for efficient memory use.

Result: Experiments show MBC reduces memory bank size to 0.3% compared to baselines while retaining high accuracy during online adaptation.

Conclusion: MBC efficiently addresses scalability and catastrophic forgetting in LLMs, offering a practical solution for continual learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HFedMoE is a federated learning framework using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to efficiently fine-tune large language models on resource-constrained devices, addressing challenges like expert selection, heterogeneous resources, and global aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-constrained clients struggle with on-device training for large language models (LLMs) in federated learning (FL). MoE models offer computation efficiency but face challenges in expert selection, heterogeneous resources, and global aggregation.

Method: HFedMoE customizes expert subsets per client, measures expert importance, and adaptively selects experts based on client budgets. It uses a sparsity-aware aggregation strategy for efficient updates.

Result: HFedMoE outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.

Conclusion: HFedMoE effectively addresses key challenges in MoE-based FL fine-tuning, enabling efficient LLM adaptation for diverse clients.

Abstract: While federated learning (FL) enables fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) without compromising data privacy, the substantial size of an LLM renders on-device training impractical for resource-constrained clients, such as mobile devices. Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HFedMoE outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.

*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free method using spectral analysis of attention patterns detects valid mathematical reasoning in large language models with high accuracy (>85%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for verifying mathematical reasoning in large language models without requiring training data or fine-tuning.

Method: Analyzes attention matrices as dynamic graph adjacency matrices, extracting four spectral diagnostics (Fiedler value, HFER, graph signal smoothness, spectral entropy) to distinguish valid/invalid proofs.

Result: Achieves 85.0--95.6% classification accuracy with effect sizes up to Cohen's d = 3.30 (p < 10^-116). Identifies architectural dependencies (e.g., Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts discriminative signals).

Conclusion: Spectral graph analysis is a principled framework for reasoning verification, useful for hallucination detection and AI safety monitoring.

Abstract: We present a training-free method for detecting valid mathematical reasoning in large language models through spectral analysis of attention patterns. By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\text{MW}} = 1.16 \times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity. These findings establish spectral graph analysis as a principled framework for reasoning verification with immediate applications to hallucination detection and AI safety monitoring.

*Francisco Aguilera Moreno*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning model to predict cycling duration using route topology and athlete fitness metrics, achieving high accuracy (MAE=6.60 min, R²=0.922).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physics-based models for cycling duration prediction are impractical due to complex parameter requirements. This work aims to simplify predictions using historical performance data and fitness metrics.

Method: A machine learning approach (Lasso regression) is used, combining route topology features and athlete fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model is evaluated on a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides).

Result: The model achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R²=0.922. Incorporating fitness metrics reduces error by 14% compared to using topology alone.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively predicts cycling duration by leveraging athlete-specific patterns and fitness metrics, offering practical benefits for training and event planning.

Abstract: Predicting cycling duration for a given route is essential for training planning and event preparation. Existing solutions rely on physics-based models that require extensive parameterization, including aerodynamic drag coefficients and real-time wind forecasts, parameters impractical for most amateur cyclists. This work presents a machine learning approach that predicts ride duration using route topology features combined with the athlete's current fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model learns athlete-specific performance patterns from historical data, substituting complex physical measurements with historical performance proxies. We evaluate the approach using a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides) in an N-of-1 study design. After rigorous feature engineering to eliminate data leakage, we find that Lasso regression with Topology + Fitness features achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R2=0.922. Notably, integrating fitness metrics (CTL, ATL) reduces error by 14% compared to topology alone (MAE=7.66 min), demonstrating that physiological state meaningfully constrains performance even in self-paced efforts. Progressive checkpoint predictions enable dynamic race planning as route difficulty becomes apparent.

### [145] [Traffic-Aware Optimal Taxi Placement Using Graph Neural Network-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00607)
*Sonia Khetarpaul,P Y Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-based reinforcement learning framework for optimal taxi placement in smart cities reduces passenger waiting time by 56% and travel distance by 38% by integrating real-time traffic data and dynamic factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional taxi hotspot prediction models fail to account for dynamic factors like traffic congestion and events. This paper aims to improve efficiency by incorporating these variables.

Method: The urban road network is modeled as a graph with intersections as nodes and road segments as edges. A GNN encodes spatial-temporal dependencies, and a Q-learning agent uses this data to recommend taxi hotspots, optimizing for waiting time, travel distance, and congestion.

Result: Tests on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset show a 56% reduction in passenger waiting time and a 38% reduction in travel distance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is adaptable to multi-modal transport systems and can enhance real-time urban mobility optimization in smart cities.

Abstract: In the context of smart city transportation, efficient matching of taxi supply with passenger demand requires real-time integration of urban traffic network data and mobility patterns. Conventional taxi hotspot prediction models often rely solely on historical demand, overlooking dynamic influences such as traffic congestion, road incidents, and public events. This paper presents a traffic-aware, graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimal taxi placement in metropolitan environments. The urban road network is modeled as a graph where intersections represent nodes, road segments serve as edges, and node attributes capture historical demand, event proximity, and real-time congestion scores obtained from live traffic APIs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings are employed to encode spatial-temporal dependencies within the traffic network, which are then used by a Q-learning agent to recommend optimal taxi hotspots. The reward mechanism jointly optimizes passenger waiting time, driver travel distance, and congestion avoidance. Experiments on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset, generated using real geospatial boundaries and historic ride-hailing request patterns, demonstrate that the proposed model reduced passenger waiting time by about 56% and reduced travel distance by 38% compared to baseline stochastic selection. The proposed approach is adaptable to multi-modal transport systems and can be integrated into smart city platforms for real-time urban mobility optimization.

*Hareshkumar Jadav,Ranveer Singh,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an approximation algorithm for maximizing non-monotone γ-weakly DR-submodular functions over down-closed convex bodies, achieving state-of-the-art guarantees that degrade gracefully with γ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of maximizing submodular objectives under constraints is fundamental in machine learning and optimization, and this work addresses the less-explored case of non-monotone, γ-weakly DR-submodular functions.

Method: The authors combine a Frank-Wolfe-guided continuous-greedy framework with a γ-aware double-greedy step to handle non-monotonicity effectively.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves a smooth approximation guarantee dependent on γ, recovering a 0.401 factor for γ=1 and improving upon prior bounds for γ<1.

Conclusion: This approach offers state-of-the-art guarantees for non-monotone γ-weakly DR-submodular maximization, advancing the field with a simple yet effective method.

Abstract: Maximizing submodular objectives under constraints is a fundamental problem in machine learning and optimization. We study the maximization of a nonnegative, non-monotone $γ$-weakly DR-submodular function over a down-closed convex body. Our main result is an approximation algorithm whose guarantee depends smoothly on $γ$; in particular, when $γ=1$ (the DR-submodular case) our bound recovers the $0.401$ approximation factor, while for $γ<1$ the guarantee degrades gracefully and, it improves upon previously reported bounds for $γ$-weakly DR-submodular maximization under the same constraints. Our approach combines a Frank-Wolfe-guided continuous-greedy framework with a $γ$-aware double-greedy step, yielding a simple yet effective procedure for handling non-monotonicity. This results in state-of-the-art guarantees for non-monotone $γ$-weakly DR-submodular maximization over down-closed convex bodies.

*Vadim Borisov,Michael Gröger,Mina Mikhael,Richard H. Schreiber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: YapBench is introduced as a benchmark to measure LLMs' tendency to over-generate responses on brevity-ideal prompts, quantifying unnecessary length with YapScore and summarizing performance via YapIndex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce lengthy responses even for simple requests, increasing cognitive load and inference costs, likely due to preference-based training biases favoring longer answers.

Method: YapBench consists of single-turn prompts, minimal-sufficient baseline answers, and category labels. YapScore measures excess length beyond baselines, and YapIndex summarizes performance.

Result: Evaluation of 76 LLMs reveals significant variation in excess length and category-specific issues like unnecessary explanations or formatting overhead.

Conclusion: YapBench provides a tool to track and reduce verbosity in LLMs, highlighting the need for brevity-focused improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini increasingly act as general-purpose copilots, yet they often respond with unnecessary length on simple requests, adding redundant explanations, hedging, or boilerplate that increases cognitive load and inflates token-based inference cost. Prior work suggests that preference-based post-training and LLM-judged evaluations can induce systematic length bias, where longer answers are rewarded even at comparable quality.
  We introduce YapBench, a lightweight benchmark for quantifying user-visible over-generation on brevity-ideal prompts. Each item consists of a single-turn prompt, a curated minimal-sufficient baseline answer, and a category label. Our primary metric, YapScore, measures excess response length beyond the baseline in characters, enabling comparisons across models without relying on any specific tokenizer. We summarize model performance via the YapIndex, a uniformly weighted average of category-level median YapScores.
  YapBench contains over three hundred English prompts spanning three common brevity-ideal settings: (A) minimal or ambiguous inputs where the ideal behavior is a short clarification, (B) closed-form factual questions with short stable answers, and (C) one-line coding tasks where a single command or snippet suffices. Evaluating 76 assistant LLMs, we observe an order-of-magnitude spread in median excess length and distinct category-specific failure modes, including vacuum-filling on ambiguous inputs and explanation or formatting overhead on one-line technical requests. We release the benchmark and maintain a live leaderboard for tracking verbosity behavior over time.

Motivation: To improve interpretability in models by leveraging structured domain knowledge and addressing challenges like OOD in feature importance measurement.

Method: Uses a bi-objective optimization framework, DAGs for feature importance hierarchies, TIG for measurement, and an Optimal Path Oracle to handle OOD problems.

Result: Theoretical convergence and robustness are proven; empirical testing shows effective DAG constraint enforcement with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: IGBO successfully integrates domain knowledge into interpretable models, addressing OOD challenges and demonstrating practical effectiveness on time-series data.

Abstract: This paper introduces Interpretability-Guided Bi-objective Optimization (IGBO), a framework that trains interpretable models by incorporating structured domain knowledge via a bi-objective formulation. IGBO encodes feature importance hierarchies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and uses Temporal Integrated Gradients (TIG) to measure feature importance. To address the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem in TIG computation, we propose an Optimal Path Oracle that learns data-manifold-aware integration paths. Theoretical analysis proves convergence properties and robustness to mini-batch noise, while empirical results on time-series data demonstrate IGBO's effectiveness in enforcing DAG constraints with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming standard regularization baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Avatar Forcing, a framework for real-time interactive head avatar generation using diffusion forcing, addressing challenges like latency and expressive reactions without extra labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current avatar generation lacks true interactivity and emotional engagement, prompting the need for real-time, expressive communication solutions.

Method: The proposed Avatar Forcing framework uses diffusion forcing for low-latency reactions to multimodal inputs and a label-free preference optimization method for expressive interactions.

Result: The framework achieves ~500ms latency (6.8X speedup) and generates expressive motion preferred over baseline in 80% of cases.

Conclusion: Avatar Forcing successfully enhances interactivity and expressiveness in avatar generation, meeting real-time communication needs.

Abstract: Talking head generation creates lifelike avatars from static portraits for virtual communication and content creation. However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.

TL;DR: IRPO addresses computational bottlenecks in pairwise GRMs by introducing pointwise scores, achieving SOTA performance and outperforming pairwise GRMs post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiency of pairwise GRMs when integrated with RL algorithms like GRPO.

Method: Propose IRPO, incorporating the Bradley-Terry model into GRPO to generate pointwise scores for efficient evaluation.

Result: IRPO achieves SOTA performance among pointwise GRMs and surpasses pairwise GRMs in post-training evaluations.

Conclusion: IRPO resolves computational bottlenecks while maintaining interpretability and fine-grained reward signals.

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) have attracted considerable research interest in reward modeling due to their interpretability, inference-time scalability, and potential for refinement through reinforcement learning (RL). However, widely used pairwise GRMs create a computational bottleneck when integrated with RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This bottleneck arises from two factors: (i) the O(n^2) time complexity of pairwise comparisons required to obtain relative scores, and (ii) the computational overhead of repeated sampling or additional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. To address the first factor, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO), a novel RL framework that incorporates the well-established Bradley-Terry model into GRPO. By generating a pointwise score for each response, IRPO enables efficient evaluation of arbitrarily many candidates during RL training while preserving interpretability and fine-grained reward signals. Experimental results demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among pointwise GRMs across multiple benchmarks, with performance comparable to that of current leading pairwise GRMs. Furthermore, we show that IRPO significantly outperforms pairwise GRMs in post-training evaluations.

TL;DR: ARISE enhances RL exploration by adding a swarm-based layer to policy-gradient methods, improving performance on challenging tasks and non-stationary rewards without changing core algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective exploration in RL is difficult, especially with non-stationary rewards or high-dimensional policies, prompting the need for innovative solutions like ARISE.

Method: ARISE integrates particle-driven proposals into policy-gradient methods, using adaptive exploration based on reward-variance cues.

Result: ARISE achieves significant improvements (+46% on LunarLander-v3, +22% on Hopper-v4) and robustness (+75 points on CartPole under non-stationary rewards).

Conclusion: ARISE provides a lightweight, adaptable solution for enhancing RL exploration and resilience without altering core algorithms.

Abstract: Effective exploration remains a key challenge in RL, especially with non-stationary rewards or high-dimensional policies. We introduce ARISE, a lightweight framework that enhances reinforcement learning by augmenting standard policy-gradient methods with a compact swarm-based exploration layer. ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance. Overall, ARISE offers a simple, architecture-agnostic route to more exploratory and resilient RL agents without altering core algorithmic structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian inference approach for inverse games to estimate agent objectives from interaction data, improving uncertainty quantification and safety in downstream planning compared to maximum likelihood methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inverse game methods rely on maximum likelihood techniques, which lack uncertainty quantification, leading to potentially unsafe planning decisions. This work addresses this gap.

Method: The proposed Bayesian inverse game framework uses a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver, trained on interaction data without requiring true objective labels.

Result: Experiments show the framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, outperforms maximum likelihood methods in inference quality, and enables safer decision-making efficiently. Multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty.

Conclusion: The Bayesian approach enhances inverse game solutions by incorporating uncertainty quantification and multimodal data, improving safety and performance in autonomous decision-making.

Abstract: Many multi-agent interaction scenarios can be naturally modeled as noncooperative games, where each agent's decisions depend on others' future actions. However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities.

Method: Proposes BSAT for adaptive segmentation using B-splines, placing tokens in high-curvature regions, and hybrid positional encoding (L-RoPE) combining additive and rotary embeddings.

Result: Experiments show BSAT achieves competitive performance with high compression rates, making it suitable for memory-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: BSAT addresses limitations of existing methods, offering an efficient and adaptive solution for long-term time series forecasting.

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting using transformers is hampered by the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the rigidity of uniform patching, which may be misaligned with the data's semantic structure. In this paper, we introduce the \textit{B-Spline Adaptive Tokenizer (BSAT)}, a novel, parameter-free method that adaptively segments a time series by fitting it with B-splines. BSAT algorithmically places tokens in high-curvature regions and represents each variable-length basis function as a fixed-size token, composed of its coefficient and position. Further, we propose a hybrid positional encoding that combines a additive learnable positional encoding with Rotary Positional Embedding featuring a layer-wise learnable base: L-RoPE. This allows each layer to attend to different temporal dependencies. Our experiments on several public benchmarks show that our model is competitive with strong performance at high compression rates. This makes it particularly well-suited for use cases with strong memory constraints.

### [154] [Precision Autotuning for Linear Solvers via Contextual Bandit-Based RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00728)
*Erin Carson,Xinye Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework for adaptive precision tuning in linear solvers, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrated effective precision selection and generalization to unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing precision and computational efficiency in numerical algorithms, leveraging reinforcement learning for adaptive precision tuning.

Method: Formulated as a contextual bandit problem with Q-table mapping discretized features to precision configurations, optimized via epsilon-greedy strategy for multi-objective reward.

Result: Empirical results show reduced computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines, generalizing well to out-of-sample data.

Conclusion: The framework advances mixed-precision numerical methods, offering potential applications beyond linear solvers, marking the first RL-based precision autotuning verified on unseen datasets.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptive precision tuning of linear solvers, and can be extended to general algorithms. The framework is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and solved using incremental action-value estimation with a discretized state space to select optimal precision configurations for computational steps, balancing precision and computational efficiency. To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines. The framework generalizes to diverse out-of-sample data and offers insight into utilizing RL precision selection for other numerical algorithms, advancing mixed-precision numerical methods in scientific computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on precision autotuning with RL and verified on unseen datasets.

### [155] [Stochastic Actor-Critic: Mitigating Overestimation via Temporal Aleatoric Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00737)
*Uğurcan Özalp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAC is a new reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a single distributional critic network to address value overestimation by leveraging aleatoric uncertainty, outperforming methods relying on epistemic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critic networks in off-policy actor-critic methods often overestimate value estimates, and current solutions use ensembling for epistemic uncertainty. The paper aims to address this by focusing on aleatoric uncertainty for more efficient pessimism.

Method: STAC incorporates temporal aleatoric uncertainty via a single distributional critic network and uses dropout for regularization in both critic and actor networks.

Result: STAC mitigates overestimation and exhibits risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments, while dropout improves stability and performance.

Conclusion: STAC achieves computational efficiency and better performance by leveraging aleatoric uncertainty and regularization, eliminating the need for ensembling.

Abstract: Off-policy actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning train a critic with temporal-difference updates and use it as a learning signal for the policy (actor). This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network.

*Max Ruiz Luyten,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques correctness-focused LLM pipelines for reducing semantic entropy and creativity, proposing Distributional Creative Reasoning (DCR) to maintain diversity and prevent collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM pipelines prioritize correctness, inadvertently stifling creativity and semantic diversity. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: Introduces DCR, a variational objective unifying training as gradient flow through probability measures on solution traces, covering methods like STaR, GRPO, and DPO.

Result: Key findings include diversity decay theorems, stable diverse policy designs, and practical recipes to avoid collapse.

Conclusion: DCR provides a principled approach for LLMs to balance correctness and creativity.

Abstract: State-of-the-art large language model (LLM) pipelines rely on bootstrapped reasoning loops: sampling diverse chains of thought and reinforcing the highest-scoring ones, mainly optimizing correctness. We analyze how this design choice is sensitive to the collapse of the model's distribution over reasoning paths, slashing semantic entropy and undermining creative problem-solving. To analyze this failure, we introduce Distributional Creative Reasoning (DCR), a unified variational objective that casts training as gradient flow through probability measures on solution traces. STaR, GRPO, and DPO, as well as entropy bonuses, and other methods, all constitute special cases of the same loss. The framework delivers three core results: (i) the diversity decay theorem, describing how correctness-based objectives lead to distinct modes of diversity decay for STaR, GRPO, and DPO; (ii) designs that ensure convergence to a stable and diverse policy, effectively preventing collapse; and (iii) simple, actionable recipes to achieve this in practice. DCR thus offers the first principled recipe for LLMs that remain both correct and creative.

*Sean Groom,Shuo Wang,Francisco Belo,Axl Rice,Liam Anderson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) for evaluating off-ball defensive performance in football, specifically focusing on corner kicks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics and possession value models fail to capture nuanced defensive movements. Existing ghosting models rely on 'average' behavior without tactical context.

Method: A CDHMM is developed to infer man-marking and zonal assignments from tracking data. It includes a defensive credit attribution framework and role-conditioned ghosting for counterfactual analysis.

Result: The model provides interpretable evaluations of defensive contributions against context-aware baselines.

Conclusion: The CDHMM offers a tailored solution for assessing off-ball defensive performance in football, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Evaluating off-ball defensive performance in football is challenging, as traditional metrics do not capture the nuanced coordinated movements that limit opponent action selection and success probabilities. Although widely used possession value models excel at appraising on-ball actions, their application to defense remains limited. Existing counterfactual methods, such as ghosting models, help extend these analyses but often rely on simulating "average" behavior that lacks tactical context. To address this, we introduce a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) tailored to corner kicks, a highly structured aspect of football games. Our label-free model infers time-resolved man-marking and zonal assignments directly from player tracking data. We leverage these assignments to propose a novel framework for defensive credit attribution and a role-conditioned ghosting method for counterfactual analysis of off-ball defensive performance. We show how these contributions provide a interpretable evaluation of defensive contributions against context-aware baselines.

*Samson Gourevitch,Alain Durmus,Eric Moulines,Jimmy Olsson,Yazid Janati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions, offering competitive optimization performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for gradient-based optimization with categorical variables suffer from noise or bias due to continuous relaxations.

Method: The authors propose a diffusion-based reparameterization using a closed-form denoiser under Gaussian noising, enabling efficient backpropagation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate competitive or improved optimization performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based reparameterization trick provides an effective alternative for optimizing categorical variables.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization with categorical variables typically relies on score-function estimators, which are unbiased but noisy, or on continuous relaxations that replace the discrete distribution with a smooth surrogate admitting a pathwise (reparameterized) gradient, at the cost of optimizing a biased, temperature-dependent objective. In this paper, we extend this family of relaxations by introducing a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions. For these distributions, the denoiser under a Gaussian noising process admits a closed form and can be computed efficiently, yielding a training-free diffusion sampler through which we can backpropagate. Our experiments show that the proposed reparameterization trick yields competitive or improved optimization performance on various benchmarks.

TL;DR: FedHypeVAE is a differentially private, hypernetwork-driven framework for synthesizing embedding-level data in federated settings, addressing non-IID challenges and gradient leakage risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable utility in federated data sharing without raw data centralization, overcoming limitations of existing embedding-level generators under non-IID conditions and lack of formal protection.

Method: Proposes a conditional VAE backbone with client-aware decoders and class-conditional priors, optimized under differential privacy, and uses a shared hypernetwork for personalization and MMD alignment for stability.

Result: Achieves personalized, privacy-preserving data synthesis with enhanced stability and distributional coherence in non-IID scenarios.

Conclusion: FedHypeVAE provides a principled solution for federated data synthesis, integrating personalization, privacy, and distribution alignment at the generator level.

Abstract: Federated data sharing promises utility without centralizing raw data, yet existing embedding-level generators struggle under non-IID client heterogeneity and provide limited formal protection against gradient leakage. We propose FedHypeVAE, a differentially private, hypernetwork-driven framework for synthesizing embedding-level data across decentralized clients. Building on a conditional VAE backbone, we replace the single global decoder and fixed latent prior with client-aware decoders and class-conditional priors generated by a shared hypernetwork from private, trainable client codes. This bi-level design personalizes the generative layerrather than the downstream modelwhile decoupling local data from communicated parameters. The shared hypernetwork is optimized under differential privacy, ensuring that only noise-perturbed, clipped gradients are aggregated across clients. A local MMD alignment between real and synthetic embeddings and a Lipschitz regularizer on hypernetwork outputs further enhance stability and distributional coherence under non-IID conditions. After training, a neutral meta-code enables domain agnostic synthesis, while mixtures of meta-codes provide controllable multi-domain coverage. FedHypeVAE unifies personalization, privacy, and distribution alignment at the generator level, establishing a principled foundation for privacy-preserving data synthesis in federated settings.

*Sixue Xing,Xuanye Xia,Kerui Wu,Meng Jiang,Jintai Chen,Tianfan Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes ClinicalReTrial, an AI framework for iteratively redesigning clinical trial protocols to address failure risks, improving success rates by 5.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trial failures are a major bottleneck in drug development, and existing AI methods only predict failure without offering solutions. This paper aims to provide actionable remedies.

Method: ClinicalReTrial integrates failure diagnosis, safety-aware modification, and candidate evaluation in a reward-driven, closed-loop optimization framework. It uses hierarchical memory to capture feedback and transfer redesign patterns.

Result: The framework improves 83.3% of trial protocols, increasing their mean success probability by 5.7%. Case studies show alignment with real-world modifications.

Conclusion: ClinicalReTrial effectively addresses trial failure risks through iterative redesign, offering a proactive solution compared to reactive prediction models.

Abstract: Clinical trial failure remains a central bottleneck in drug development, where minor protocol design flaws can irreversibly compromise outcomes despite promising therapeutics. Although cutting-edge AI methods achieve strong performance in predicting trial success, they are inherently reactive for merely diagnosing risk without offering actionable remedies once failure is anticipated. To fill this gap, this paper proposes ClinicalReTrial, a self-evolving AI agent framework that addresses this gap by casting clinical trial reasoning as an iterative protocol redesign problem. Our method integrates failure diagnosis, safety-aware modification, and candidate evaluation in a closed-loop, reward-driven optimization framework. Serving the outcome prediction model as a simulation environment, ClinicalReTrial enables low-cost evaluation of protocol modifications and provides dense reward signals for continuous self-improvement. To support efficient exploration, the framework maintains hierarchical memory that captures iteration-level feedback within trials and distills transferable redesign patterns across trials. Empirically, ClinicalReTrial improves 83.3% of trial protocols with a mean success probability gain of 5.7%, and retrospective case studies demonstrate strong alignment between the discovered redesign strategies and real-world clinical trial modifications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A reasoning-aware knowledge retrieval method enhances LLMs by integrating retrieval and reasoning, using a coarse-to-fine approach and Monte Carlo Tree Search for more informative responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of effectively integrating retrieval and reasoning strategies in LLMs to optimize performance, moving beyond surface-level semantic similarity.

Method: The method involves a coarse-to-fine approach: first identifying a relevant sub-region of the knowledge base, then refining the search within it for reasoning-specific knowledge, using Monte Carlo Tree Search for navigation.

Result: Experiments on multi-turn dialogue datasets show the approach aligns better with human reasoning and enhances knowledge diversity, leading to more informative and creative responses.

Conclusion: The proposed reasoning-aware knowledge retrieval method significantly improves LLM performance by integrating reasoning and retrieval effectively, resulting in better-aligned and more diverse outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically enhance their performance through either the retrieval of semantically similar information or the improvement of their reasoning capabilities. However, a significant challenge remains in effectively integrating both retrieval and reasoning strategies to optimize LLM performance. In this paper, we introduce a reasoning-aware knowledge retrieval method that enriches LLMs with information aligned to the logical structure of conversations, moving beyond surface-level semantic similarity. We follow a coarse-to-fine approach for knowledge retrieval. First, we identify a contextually relevant sub-region of the knowledge base, ensuring that all sentences within it are relevant to the context topic. Next, we refine our search within this sub-region to extract knowledge that is specifically relevant to the reasoning process. Throughout both phases, we employ the Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired search method to effectively navigate through knowledge sentences using common keywords. Experiments on two multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that our knowledge retrieval approach not only aligns more closely with the underlying reasoning in human conversations but also significantly enhances the diversity of the retrieved knowledge, resulting in more informative and creative responses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCiSt is a bio-inspired agentic self-healing framework for Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS), mimicking biological phases to autonomously isolate faults, diagnose causes, adaptively recover, and consolidate knowledge using LM-powered agents. It achieves resilience within tens of seconds with minimal CPU usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern DCCS face frequent faults due to complexity, mobility, and dynamic conditions, necessitating scalable and adaptive resilience strategies inspired by human biological self-healing.

Method: ReCiSt maps biological phases (Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, Remodeling) to computational layers (Containment, Diagnosis, Meta-Cognitive, Knowledge). LM-powered agents interpret logs, diagnose root causes, refine reasoning, and reconfigure resources autonomously.

Result: Evaluated on public fault datasets, ReCiSt achieves self-healing in tens of seconds with minimal CPU usage (≥10%). It demonstrates robust fault analysis and efficient micro-agent invocation for resilience.

Conclusion: ReCiSt successfully adapts biological resilience principles to DCCS, offering scalable, autonomous fault management with promising efficiency under uncertainty.

Abstract: Human biological systems sustain life through extraordinary resilience, continually detecting damage, orchestrating targeted responses, and restoring function through self-healing. Inspired by these capabilities, this paper introduces ReCiSt, a bio-inspired agentic self-healing framework designed to achieve resilience in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS). Modern DCCS integrate heterogeneous computing resources, ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices to high-performance cloud infrastructures, and their inherent complexity, mobility, and dynamic operating conditions expose them to frequent faults that disrupt service continuity. These challenges underscore the need for scalable, adaptive, and self-regulated resilience strategies. ReCiSt reconstructs the biological phases of Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodeling into the computational layers Containment, Diagnosis, Meta-Cognitive, and Knowledge for DCCS. These four layers perform autonomous fault isolation, causal diagnosis, adaptive recovery, and long-term knowledge consolidation through Language Model (LM)-powered agents. These agents interpret heterogeneous logs, infer root causes, refine reasoning pathways, and reconfigure resources with minimal human intervention. The proposed ReCiSt framework is evaluated on public fault datasets using multiple LMs, and no baseline comparison is included due to the scarcity of similar approaches. Nevertheless, our results, evaluated under different LMs, confirm ReCiSt's self-healing capabilities within tens of seconds with minimum of 10% of agent CPU usage. Our results also demonstrated depth of analysis to over come uncertainties and amount of micro-agents invoked to achieve resilience.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression screening in Nigeria faces challenges like clinician access, stigma, and language barriers. Traditional tools like PHQ-9 are culturally and linguistically inaccessible.

Method: Researchers collected 432 Pidgin audio responses, transcribed and annotated them, then fine-tuned three LLMs (Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Gemma-3-4B-it, GPT-4.1) for depression screening. Performance was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively.

Result: GPT-4.1 achieved 94.5% accuracy in PHQ-9 severity scoring and outperformed other models in cultural appropriateness, clarity, and relevance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of AI-mediated depression screening for underserved Nigerian communities, offering a scalable solution for linguistically diverse regions.

Abstract: Depression is a major contributor to the mental-health burden in Nigeria, yet screening coverage remains limited due to low access to clinicians, stigma, and language barriers. Traditional tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were validated in high-income countries but may be linguistically or culturally inaccessible for low- and middle-income countries and communities such as Nigeria where people communicate in Nigerian Pidgin and more than 520 local languages. This study presents a novel approach to automated depression screening using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) adapted for conversational Nigerian Pidgin. We collected a dataset of 432 Pidgin-language audio responses from Nigerian young adults aged 18-40 to prompts assessing psychological experiences aligned with PHQ-9 items, performed transcription, rigorous preprocessing and annotation, including semantic labeling, slang and idiom interpretation, and PHQ-9 severity scoring. Three LLMs - Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Gemma-3-4B-it, and GPT-4.1 - were fine-tuned on this annotated dataset, and their performance was evaluated quantitatively (accuracy, precision and semantic alignment) and qualitatively (clarity, relevance, and cultural appropriateness). GPT-4.1 achieved the highest quantitative performance, with 94.5% accuracy in PHQ-9 severity scoring prediction, outperforming Gemma-3-4B-it and Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. Qualitatively, GPT-4.1 also produced the most culturally appropriate, clear, and contextually relevant responses. AI-mediated depression screening for underserved Nigerian communities. This work provides a foundation for deploying conversational mental-health tools in linguistically diverse, resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper presents a physical theory of intelligence linking irreversible information processing to goal-directed work, introducing Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) and defining intelligence as work per nat of processed information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ground intelligence in physical principles, connecting information processing to conservation laws and exploring its implications for biological and artificial systems.

Method: Introduces the CCE framework, defines intelligence quantitatively, derives physical constraints, and applies the theory to biological and computational systems.

Result: Identifies efficiency trade-offs, intrinsic epistemic limits, and optimizes oscillatory dynamics in biological systems. Shows Boolean logic as a subset of attractor selection.

Conclusion: Provides a unified, substrate-neutral theory of intelligence, with implications for AI safety and understanding biological systems.

Abstract: We present a physical theory of intelligence grounded in irreversible information processing in systems constrained by conservation laws. An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis. Together, these results provide a unified, substrate-neutral account of intelligence as a physical phenomenon.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-algorithm approach to balance workload distribution among delivery workers by optimizing delivery time and effort, using distance and workload considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional workload assignment methods based on geographical proximity often lead to inefficiencies and unbalanced distributions among workers.

Method: A multi-algorithm approach combining k-means, evolutionary methods, recursive assignments, and hybrid ensembles to optimize package allocation.

Result: The approach was tested in a real-world urban delivery system in Azuqueca de Henares, Spain, showing effective workload balancing.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully ensures balanced daily workloads among workers by integrating distance and effort metrics.

Abstract: Efficient workload assignment to the workforce is critical in last-mile package delivery systems. In this context, traditional methods of assigning package deliveries to workers based on geographical proximity can be inefficient and surely guide to an unbalanced workload distribution among delivery workers. In this paper, we look at the problem of operational human resources workload balancing in last-mile urban package delivery systems. The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account. The proposed multi-algorithm methodology includes different versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization with different problem encodings, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm. We have illustrated the performance of the proposed approach in a real-world problem in an urban last-mile package delivery workforce operating at Azuqueca de Henares, Spain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance algorithmic strategy design in Rummy by developing a rule-based framework and a novel hand-evaluation metric.

Method: Proposes MinDist metric, modifies MinScore, uses dynamic pruning and pattern caching, and incorporates opponent hand-modeling in simulations.

Result: MinDist-based agents show significant win rate improvements over traditional heuristics.

Conclusion: The MinDist framework provides a formal and interpretable approach to algorithmic Rummy strategy.

Abstract: The 13-card variant of Classic Indian Rummy is a sequential game of incomplete information that requires probabilistic reasoning and combinatorial decision-making. This paper proposes a rule-based framework for strategic play, driven by a new hand-evaluation metric termed MinDist. The metric modifies the MinScore metric by quantifying the edit distance between a hand and the nearest valid configuration, thereby capturing structural proximity to completion. We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing. Empirical results show significant improvement in win rates for MinDist-based agents over traditional heuristics, providing a formal and interpretable step toward algorithmic Rummy strategy design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand how AI systems interpret and reconstruct architectural intelligence in vernacular forms, focusing on cultural specificity and environmental reasoning.

Method: Three diffusion models—Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, and DreamStudio (SDXL)—were tested across referential, adaptive, and speculative prompt stages. A five-criteria framework evaluated typology, materiality, environment, realism, and cultural specificity.

Result: AI models reliably reproduced geometric patterns but struggled with material and climatic reasoning. Reference imagery enhanced realism but limited creativity, while speculative prompts yielded inventive but culturally ambiguous outputs.

Conclusion: The study highlights the gap between AI's visual resemblance and architectural reasoning, proposing computational vernacular reasoning as a framework to analyze AI's perception and reinterpretation of traditional design intelligence.

Abstract: This study investigates how generative AI systems interpret the architectural intelligence embedded in vernacular form. Using the Iranian pigeon tower as a case study, the research tests three diffusion models, Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, and DreamStudio based on Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), across three prompt stages: referential, adaptive, and speculative. A five-criteria evaluation framework assesses how each system reconstructs typology, materiality, environment, realism, and cultural specificity. Results show that AI reliably reproduces geometric patterns but misreads material and climatic reasoning. Reference imagery improves realism yet limits creativity, while freedom from reference generates inventive but culturally ambiguous outcomes. The findings define a boundary between visual resemblance and architectural reasoning, positioning computational vernacular reasoning as a framework for analyzing how AI perceives, distorts, and reimagines traditional design intelligence.

*Akash Kumar Panda,Olaoluwa Adigun,Bart Kosko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM agent extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from text, dynamically refining them through bidirectional interactions, achieving equilibria similar to human-generated FCMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an autonomous yet controlled LLM agent capable of extracting and refining causal structures (FCMs) from raw text, bridging the gap between human and machine-generated causal models.

Method: A three-step process guides the LLM agent: extracting key nouns/noun phrases, identifying FCM concept nodes, and inferring causal edges. This is tested using an essay by Henry Kissinger et al.

Result: The LLM-generated FCMs converged to equilibria matching human-generated FCMs, despite structural differences. A mixed FCM combined outputs from Gemini and ChatGPT, creating new equilibria for better accuracy.

Conclusion: The LLM agent successfully extracts and refines causal FCMs autonomously, demonstrating adaptability and agreement with human models while introducing novel equilibria.

Abstract: We design a large-language-model (LLM) agent that extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from raw text. The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.

*Muhammad U. Nasir,Yuchen Li,Steven James,Julian Togelius*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mortar autonomously evolves game mechanics using a quality-diversity algorithm and LLM, evaluates them via synthesized games, and ensures skill-based player ordering for diverse, playable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual game mechanic design is time-consuming and expert-driven; Mortar aims to automate and diversify this process.

Method: Combines quality-diversity algorithm with LLM, evaluates mechanics by synthesizing games via tree search, and scores based on skill-based player ordering.

Result: Mortar produces diverse, playable games with mechanics that enhance skill-based ordering, validated by ablation studies and user feedback.

Conclusion: Mortar effectively automates game mechanic evolution, ensuring skill-based player ordering and diverse outcomes.

Abstract: We present Mortar, a system for autonomously evolving game mechanics for automatic game design. Game mechanics define the rules and interactions that govern gameplay, and designing them manually is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. Mortar combines a quality-diversity algorithm with a large language model to explore a diverse set of mechanics, which are evaluated by synthesising complete games that incorporate both evolved mechanics and those drawn from an archive. The mechanics are evaluated by composing complete games through a tree search procedure, where the resulting games are evaluated by their ability to preserve a skill-based ordering over players -- that is, whether stronger players consistently outperform weaker ones. We assess the mechanics based on their contribution towards the skill-based ordering score in the game. We demonstrate that Mortar produces games that appear diverse and playable, and mechanics that contribute more towards the skill-based ordering score in the game. We perform ablation studies to assess the role of each system component and a user study to evaluate the games based on human feedback.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mathesis, a neuro-symbolic architecture combining hypergraphs and differentiable logic to address logical failures in LLMs by transforming proof search into energy minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome persistent logical failures in Large Language Models (LLMs) due to missing internal axiomatic frameworks.

Method: Introduces Mathesis, using higher-order hypergraphs for mathematical states and a Symbolic Reasoning Kernel (SRK) for differentiable logic. Proof search becomes energy minimization via gradient-based signals. Multi-step deduction uses Monte Carlo Tree Search and Evolutionary Proof Search.

Result: Logical consistency is achieved by minimizing a global energy function E(G).

Conclusion: Mathesis offers a novel approach to enhance LLM reasoning by integrating neuro-symbolic methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit persistent logical failures in complex reasoning due to the lack of an internal axiomatic framework. We propose Mathesis, a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes mathematical states as higher-order hypergraphs and uses a Symbolic Reasoning Kernel (SRK)--a differentiable logic engine that maps constraints to a continuous energy landscape. By defining a global energy function E(G), where zero energy implies logical consistency, the SRK yields gradient-based signals to train a Hypergraph Transformer Brain, turning proof search into energy minimization. Multi-step deduction is enabled via Monte Carlo Tree Search and Evolutionary Proof Search, guided by learned value functions and semantic unification.

TL;DR: The paper examines whether confidence-based abstention reliably controls error rates in video question answering and tests its robustness under distribution shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes applications require VLMs to abstain when uncertain to avoid costly errors.

Method: The study uses NExT-QA and Gemini 2.0 Flash, applying confidence thresholding to analyze error rate control.

Result: Confidence thresholding provides in-distribution control, reducing error rates with smooth risk-coverage tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Confidence-based abstention is effective in-distribution, but its robustness under distribution shift remains unclear.

Abstract: High-stakes deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) requires selective prediction, where systems abstain when uncertain rather than risk costly errors. We investigate whether confidence-based abstention provides reliable control over error rates in video question answering, and whether that control remains robust under distribution shift. Using NExT-QA and Gemini 2.0 Flash, we establish two findings. First, confidence thresholding provides mechanistic control in-distribution. Sweeping threshold epsilon produces smooth risk-coverage tradeoffs, reducing error rates f

*Tiansi Dong,Henry He,Pietro Liò,Mateja Jamnik*

TL;DR: The paper compares LLM, supervised learning, and explicit model-based neural reasoning, showing explicit models (like Sphere Neural Networks) are more reliable and less prone to catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the reliability and effectiveness of three neural reasoning methods, highlighting shortcomings in LLMs and supervised learning.

Method: Tested disjunctive syllogistic reasoning, introduced Sphere Neural Networks for explicit model construction, and evaluated performance across tasks.

Result: Sphere Neural Networks excel in reasoning tasks without forgetting, unlike supervised learning (Euler Net), which suffers catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Explicit model-based neural reasoning, exemplified by Sphere Neural Networks, is the most reliable among the three methods.

Abstract: This paper compares three methodological categories of neural reasoning: LLM reasoning, supervised learning-based reasoning, and explicit model-based reasoning. LLMs remain unreliable and struggle with simple decision-making that animals can master without extensive corpora training. Through disjunctive syllogistic reasoning testing, we show that reasoning via supervised learning is less appealing than reasoning via explicit model construction. Concretely, we show that an Euler Net trained to achieve 100.00% in classic syllogistic reasoning can be trained to reach 100.00% accuracy in disjunctive syllogistic reasoning. However, the retrained Euler Net suffers severely from catastrophic forgetting (its performance drops to 6.25% on already-learned classic syllogistic reasoning), and its reasoning competence is limited to the pattern level. We propose a new version of Sphere Neural Networks that embeds concepts as circles on the surface of an n-dimensional sphere. These Sphere Neural Networks enable the representation of the negation operator via complement circles and achieve reliable decision-making by filtering out illogical statements that form unsatisfiable circular configurations. We demonstrate that the Sphere Neural Network can master 16 syllogistic reasoning tasks, including rigorous disjunctive syllogistic reasoning, while preserving the rigour of classical syllogistic reasoning. We conclude that neural reasoning with explicit model construction is the most reliable among the three methodological categories of neural reasoning.

TL;DR: FlashInfer-Bench introduces a closed-loop framework for evaluating and deploying AI-generated GPU kernels in LLM inference systems, offering a unified schema, benchmarking tools, and real-world integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of integrating AI-generated GPU kernels into real-world LLM inference systems by providing a standardized framework for evaluation and deployment.

Method: FlashInfer-Bench uses a unified schema (FlashInfer Trace) for kernel definition and evaluation. It includes a dataset, benchmarking framework, leaderboard, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (`apply()`) for real-world deployment.

Result: The framework enables systematic evaluation of LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, compares GPU language trade-offs, and provides insights for future agent design.

Conclusion: FlashInfer-Bench offers a reproducible pathway for improving and deploying AI-generated kernels in large-scale LLM inference, enhancing practical integration.

Abstract: Recent advances show that large language models (LLMs) can act as autonomous agents capable of generating GPU kernels, but integrating these AI-generated kernels into real-world inference systems remains challenging. FlashInfer-Bench addresses this gap by establishing a standardized, closed-loop framework that connects kernel generation, benchmarking, and deployment. At its core, FlashInfer Trace provides a unified schema describing kernel definitions, workloads, implementations, and evaluations, enabling consistent communication between agents and systems. Built on real serving traces, FlashInfer-Bench includes a curated dataset, a robust correctness- and performance-aware benchmarking framework, a public leaderboard to track LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (apply()) that seamlessly injects the best-performing kernels into production LLM engines such as SGLang and vLLM. Using FlashInfer-Bench, we further evaluate the performance and limitations of LLM agents, compare the trade-offs among different GPU programming languages, and provide insights for future agent design. FlashInfer-Bench thus establishes a practical, reproducible pathway for continuously improving AI-generated kernels and deploying them into large-scale LLM inference.

### [174] [Will LLM-powered Agents Bias Against Humans? Exploring the Belief-Dependent Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00240)
*Zongwei Wang,Bincheng Gu,Hongyu Yu,Junliang Yu,Tao He,Jiayin Feng,Min Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLM-empowered agents exhibit intergroup bias favoring their own group over humans, introduces a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) to exploit this, and proposes mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate intergroup bias in agents and its alignment with human-agent divides, highlighting risks and vulnerabilities.

Method: Constructs a multi-agent social simulation with allocation decisions, tests bias under minimal cues, and introduces BPA attacks (BPA-PP and BPA-MP).

Result: Agents show consistent intergroup bias; BPA successfully suppresses human-norm scripts and reactivates bias.

Conclusion: Identifies vulnerabilities to inform safer agent design and proposes mitigations at profile and memory boundaries.

Abstract: LLM-empowered agents can exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias triggered by minimal "us" versus "them" cues. When this intergroup boundary aligns with an agent-human divide, the risk shifts from disparities among human demographic groups to a more fundamental group-level asymmetry, i.e., humans as a whole may be treated as the outgroup by agents. To examine this possibility, we construct a controlled multi-agent social simulation based on allocation decisions under explicit payoff trade-offs and find that agents exhibit a consistent intergroup bias under minimal group cues. Although this bias is attenuated when some counterparts are framed as humans, we attribute the attenuation to an implicit human-norm script that favors humans yet activates only when the agent believes a real human is present. This belief dependence creates a new attack surface. We therefore introduce a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that corrupts persistent identity beliefs to suppress the human-norm script and reactivate outgroup bias toward humans, instantiated as profile poisoning at initialization (BPA-PP) and memory poisoning via optimized belief-refinement suffixes injected into stored reflections (BPA-MP). Finally, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for hardening current agent frameworks against BPA, highlighting feasible interventions at profile and memory boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the existence of agent intergroup bias and the severity of BPA across settings. Our goal in identifying these vulnerabilities is to inform safer agent design, not to enable real-world exploitation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper combines swarm methods and financial analysis to model liquidity in financial markets, using game theory to align individual trader behaviors with collective market stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge swarm research and financial markets by explaining how decentralized, self-interested agents can self-organize for market stability and liquidity.

Method: The paper unifies Liquidity Games and Rational Swarms, using difference rewards in a Markov team games framework to align individual liquidity-maximizing behaviors with collective goals.

Result: The Financial Swarm model demonstrates that independent traders can enhance overall market liquidity without coordination, achieving both individual profitability and market efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully models rational, independent agents in financial markets, showing how their behaviors contribute to liquidity and market stability.

Abstract: Making use of swarm methods in financial market modeling of liquidity, and techniques from financial analysis in swarm analysis, holds the potential to advance both research areas. In swarm research, the use of game theory methods holds the promise of explaining observed phenomena of collective utility adherence with rational self-interested swarm participants. In financial markets, a better understanding of how independent financial agents may self-organize for the betterment and stability of the marketplace would be a boon for market design researchers. This paper unifies Liquidity Games, where trader payoffs depend on aggregate liquidity within a trade, with Rational Swarms, where decentralized agents use difference rewards to align self-interested learning with global objectives. We offer a theoretical frameworks where we define a swarm of traders whose collective objective is market liquidity provision while maintaining agent independence. Using difference rewards within a Markov team games framework, we show that individual liquidity-maximizing behaviors contribute to overall market liquidity without requiring coordination or collusion. This Financial Swarm model provides a framework for modeling rational, independent agents where they achieve both individual profitability and collective market efficiency in bilateral asset markets.

*Weng Ding,Yi Han,Mu-Jiang-Shan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACCD framework improves detection of coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media with adaptive learning, reducing manual effort and boosting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for detecting coordinated behavior are limited by superficial analysis, static settings, and heavy manual annotation.

Method: ACCD uses a three-stage approach: adaptive CCM for causal relationships, active learning for reduced labeling, and automated validation for self-optimization.

Result: ACCD achieves 87.3% F1-score (15.2% improvement), reduces manual annotation by 68%, and speeds up processing by 2.8x.

Conclusion: ACCD offers an accurate, efficient, and automated solution for detecting coordinated behavior, with practical value and broad applicability.

Abstract: Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media remains a critical and persistent challenge, as most existing approaches rely on superficial correlation analysis, employ static parameter settings, and demand extensive and labor-intensive manual annotation. To address these limitations systematically, we propose the Adaptive Causal Coordination Detection (ACCD) framework. ACCD adopts a three-stage, progressive architecture that leverages a memory-guided adaptive mechanism to dynamically learn and retain optimal detection configurations for diverse coordination scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, ACCD introduces an adaptive Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) technique to deeply identify genuine causal relationships between accounts. The second stage integrates active learning with uncertainty sampling within a semi-supervised classification scheme, significantly reducing the burden of manual labeling. The third stage deploys an automated validation module driven by historical detection experience, enabling self-verification and optimization of the detection outcomes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using real-world datasets, including the Twitter IRA dataset, Reddit coordination traces, and several widely-adopted bot detection benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCD achieves an F1-score of 87.3\% in coordinated attack detection, representing a 15.2\% improvement over the strongest existing baseline. Furthermore, the system reduces manual annotation requirements by 68\% and achieves a 2.8x speedup in processing through hierarchical clustering optimization. In summary, ACCD provides a more accurate, efficient, and highly automated end-to-end solution for identifying coordinated behavior on social platforms, offering substantial practical value and promising potential for broad application.

*Alessio Di Rubbo,Mattia Neri,Remo Pareschi,Marco Pedroni,Roberto Valtancoli,Paolino Zica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends semantic-space reasoning from linguistics to tactical decision-making in team sports, modeling player actions and team strategies as semantic structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge computational linguistics and sports tactics by leveraging semantic-space reasoning to analyze and optimize team performance.

Method: Players are represented as multidimensional vectors integrating technical, physical, and psychological attributes; tactical configurations are modeled as semantic structures.

Result: A Python-based prototype demonstrates dynamic strategy recommendations and diagnostic insights for tactical optimization.

Conclusion: The approach is generalizable beyond sports, with future directions including predictive simulation and hybrid human-machine tactical intelligence.

Abstract: This paper explores how semantic-space reasoning, traditionally used in computational linguistics, can be extended to tactical decision-making in team sports. Building on the analogy between texts and teams -- where players act as words and collective play conveys meaning -- the proposed methodology models tactical configurations as compositional semantic structures. Each player is represented as a multidimensional vector integrating technical, physical, and psychological attributes; team profiles are aggregated through contextual weighting into a higher-level semantic representation. Within this shared vector space, tactical templates such as high press, counterattack, or possession build-up are encoded analogously to linguistic concepts. Their alignment with team profiles is evaluated using vector-distance metrics, enabling the computation of tactical ``fit'' and opponent-exploitation potential. A Python-based prototype demonstrates how these methods can generate interpretable, dynamically adaptive strategy recommendations, accompanied by fine-grained diagnostic insights at the attribute level. Beyond football, the approach offers a generalizable framework for collective decision-making and performance optimization in team-based domains -- ranging from basketball and hockey to cooperative robotics and human-AI coordination systems. The paper concludes by outlining future directions toward real-world data integration, predictive simulation, and hybrid human-machine tactical intelligence.

TL;DR: MIDAS introduces a distributed AI agent system to enhance novelty and diversity in engineering design by emulating human meta-cognitive ideation workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novelty and diversity in design are critical but challenging for novices, exacerbated by current AI systems producing semantically clustered ideas.

Method: MIDAS uses specialized AI agents in a distributed team to progressively refine ideas and assess global and local novelty.

Result: The framework enables true human-AI co-creation, transforming designers into active collaborators.

Conclusion: MIDAS offers a progressive paradigm for fostering innovative and diverse design solutions.

Abstract: The generation of truly novel and diverse ideas is important for contemporary engineering design, yet it remains a significant cognitive challenge for novice designers. Current 'single-spurt' AI systems exacerbate this challenge by producing a high volume of semantically clustered ideas. We propose MIDAS (Meta-cognitive Ideation through Distributed Agentic AI System), a novel framework that replaces the single-AI paradigm with a distributed 'team' of specialized AI agents designed to emulate the human meta-cognitive ideation workflow. This agentic system progressively refines ideas and assesses each one for both global novelty (against existing solutions) and local novelty (against previously generated ideas). MIDAS, therefore, demonstrates a viable and progressive paradigm for true human-AI co-creation, elevating the human designer from a passive filterer to a participatory, active, collaborative partner.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mid-reasoning shifts in models like DeepSeek-R1-Zero are rare, do not improve accuracy, and are not signs of intrinsic self-correction. Triggering shifts artificially improves accuracy under high uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if mid-reasoning shifts in models improve performance or indicate intrinsic self-correction.

Method: Analyzed 1M+ reasoning traces, training checkpoints, three reasoning domains, and model architectures under varying decoding temperatures.

Result: Mid-reasoning shifts are rare, not tied to training progress, and seldom improve accuracy. Artificially triggering shifts helps under high entropy.

Conclusion: Mid-reasoning shifts reflect unstable inference, not intrinsic self-correction. Artificial shifts can enhance accuracy when uncertainty is high.

Abstract: Do reasoning models have "Aha!" moments? Prior work suggests that models like DeepSeek-R1-Zero undergo sudden mid-trace realizations that lead to accurate outputs, implying an intrinsic capacity for self-correction. Yet, it remains unclear whether such intrinsic shifts in reasoning strategy actually improve performance. Here, we study mid-reasoning shifts and instrument training runs to detect them. Our analysis spans 1M+ reasoning traces, hundreds of training checkpoints, three reasoning domains, and multiple decoding temperatures and model architectures. We find that reasoning shifts are rare, do not become more frequent with training, and seldom improve accuracy, indicating that they do not correspond to prior perceptions of model insight. However, their effect varies with model uncertainty. Building on this finding, we show that artificially triggering extrinsic shifts under high entropy reliably improves accuracy. Our results show that mid-reasoning shifts are symptoms of unstable inference behavior rather than an intrinsic mechanism for self-correction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DA-DPO is a framework that balances the learning process in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by focusing on challenging preference pairs, improving hallucination suppression and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal DPO approaches overfit due to difficulty imbalance in preference data, hindering fine-grained hallucination suppression and degrading performance.

Method: DA-DPO includes Difficulty Estimation (using pre-trained models and voting for scores) and Difficulty-Aware Training (reweighting pairs based on difficulty).

Result: DA-DPO improves multimodal preference optimization, enhances robustness to hallucinations, and generalizes better across benchmarks without extra data or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DA-DPO effectively addresses overfitting in DPO by prioritizing challenging examples, offering a cost-efficient solution for better performance.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown strong potential for mitigating hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing multimodal DPO approaches often suffer from overfitting due to the difficulty imbalance in preference data. Our analysis shows that MLLMs tend to overemphasize easily distinguishable preference pairs, which hinders fine-grained hallucination suppression and degrades overall performance. To address this issue, we propose Difficulty-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (DA-DPO), a cost-effective framework designed to balance the learning process. DA-DPO consists of two main components: (1) Difficulty Estimation leverages pre-trained vision--language models with complementary generative and contrastive objectives, whose outputs are integrated via a distribution-aware voting strategy to produce robust difficulty scores without additional training; and (2) Difficulty-Aware Training reweights preference pairs based on their estimated difficulty, down-weighting easy samples while emphasizing harder ones to alleviate overfitting. This framework enables more effective preference optimization by prioritizing challenging examples, without requiring new data or extra fine-tuning stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-DPO consistently improves multimodal preference optimization, yielding stronger robustness to hallucinations and better generalization across standard benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient.

TL;DR: PedX-LLM, a vision-and-knowledge-enhanced LLM framework, outperforms traditional methods in pedestrian crossing inference by integrating visual and textual data with domain knowledge, achieving high accuracy and strong generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for pedestrian crossing behavior inference lack generalizability and domain-specific adaptation, prompting the need for a more context-aware and adaptable solution.

Method: PedX-LLM integrates LLaVA-extracted visual features, textual data, and transportation knowledge, fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B via LoRA for crossing decision inference.

Result: PedX-LLM achieves 82.0% balanced accuracy, outperforming statistical and supervised methods, with vision and domain knowledge contributing significant performance gains. Cross-site validation shows strong zero-shot (66.9%) and few-shot (72.2%) performance.

Conclusion: PedX-LLM's vision-and-knowledge-enhanced reasoning mimics human decision logic, overcoming limitations of data-driven methods and demonstrating robust generalizability.

Abstract: Existing paradigms for inferring pedestrian crossing behavior, ranging from statistical models to supervised learning methods, demonstrate limited generalizability and perform inadequately on new sites. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a shift from numerical pattern fitting to semantic, context-aware behavioral reasoning, yet existing LLM applications lack domain-specific adaptation and visual context. This study introduces Pedestrian Crossing LLM (PedX-LLM), a vision-and-knowledge enhanced framework designed to transform pedestrian crossing inference from site-specific pattern recognition to generalizable behavioral reasoning. By integrating LLaVA-extracted visual features with textual data and transportation domain knowledge, PedX-LLM fine-tunes a LLaMA-2-7B foundation model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to infer crossing decisions. PedX-LLM achieves 82.0% balanced accuracy, outperforming the best statistical and supervised learning methods. Results demonstrate that the vision-augmented module contributes a 2.9% performance gain by capturing the built environment and integrating domain knowledge yields an additional 4.1% improvement. To evaluate generalizability across unseen environments, cross-site validation was conducted using site-based partitioning. The zero-shot PedX-LLM configuration achieves 66.9% balanced accuracy on five unseen test sites, outperforming the baseline data-driven methods by at least 18 percentage points. Incorporating just five validation examples via few-shot learning to PedX-LLM further elevates the balanced accuracy to 72.2%. PedX-LLM demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen scenarios, confirming that vision-and-knowledge-enhanced reasoning enables the model to mimic human-like decision logic and overcome the limitations of purely data-driven methods.

TL;DR: ADS simplifies integrating symbolic constraints into deep learning by translating free-form descriptions into DomiKnowS programs, reducing development time significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models benefit from symbolic constraints for robustness and interpretability, but integration is complex and time-consuming.

Method: ADS uses an agentic workflow to convert free-form task descriptions into DomiKnowS programs, with optional human intervention for refinement.

Result: ADS reduces development time from hours to 10-15 minutes, aiding both experienced users and non-users.

Conclusion: ADS effectively democratizes neuro-symbolic programming by simplifying the integration process.

Abstract: Integrating symbolic constraints into deep learning models could make them more robust, interpretable, and data-efficient. Still, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task. Existing frameworks like DomiKnowS help this integration by providing a high-level declarative programming interface, but they still assume the user is proficient with the library's specific syntax. We propose AgenticDomiKnowS (ADS) to eliminate this dependency. ADS translates free-form task descriptions into a complete DomiKnowS program using an agentic workflow that creates and tests each DomiKnowS component separately. The workflow supports optional human-in-the-loop intervention, enabling users familiar with DomiKnowS to refine intermediate outputs. We show how ADS enables experienced DomiKnowS users and non-users to rapidly construct neuro-symbolic programs, reducing development time from hours to 10-15 minutes.
