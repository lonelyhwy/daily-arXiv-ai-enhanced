### [1] [Self-Supervised Masked Autoencoders with Dense-Unet for Coronary Calcium Removal in limited CT Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02392)
*Mo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dense-MAE, a self-supervised framework, improves artifact removal in CTA by pre-training Dense-Unet with masked 3D patches, enhancing accuracy in stenosis diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary calcification artifacts in CTA hinder stenosis diagnosis, and labeled datasets for supervised learning are limited in medicine.

Method: Proposes Dense-MAE, a self-supervised approach using masked 3D patches to pre-train Dense-Unet for reconstructing arterial geometry without annotations.

Result: Dense-MAE initialization boosts inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation, especially in few-shot settings, compared to training from scratch.

Conclusion: Self-supervised pre-training with Dense-MAE enhances the performance of calcium removal networks in medical imaging with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Coronary calcification creates blooming artifacts in Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), severely hampering the diagnosis of lumen stenosis. While Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) like Dense-Unet have shown promise in removing these artifacts via inpainting, they often require large labeled datasets which are scarce in the medical domain. Inspired by recent advancements in Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for 3D point clouds, we propose \textbf{Dense-MAE}, a novel self-supervised learning framework for volumetric medical data. We introduce a pre-training strategy that randomly masks 3D patches of the vessel lumen and trains the Dense-Unet to reconstruct the missing geometry. This forces the encoder to learn high-level latent features of arterial topology without human annotation. Experimental results on clinical CTA datasets demonstrate that initializing the Calcium Removal network with our MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, specifically in few-shot scenarios.

### [2] [Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning with Active Sample Selection for Medical Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02409)
*Longwei Wang,Ifrat Ikhtear Uddin,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed EGxFSL and xGAL frameworks combine few-shot learning and active learning with explainability, improving accuracy and interpretability in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses scarcity of labeled data and lack of interpretability in medical AI by integrating expert guidance and explainability.

Method: EGxFSL uses Grad-CAM-based Dice loss and prototypical classification; xGAL prioritizes uncertainty and attention misalignment.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 92%, 76%, and 62% on BraTS, VinDr-CXR, and SIIM-COVID-19 datasets, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The frameworks enhance interpretability and accuracy, demonstrating cross-modality applicability and efficiency under data constraints.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces two critical challenges: scarcity of labeled data and lack of model interpretability, both hindering clinical AI deployment. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses data limitations but lacks transparency in predictions. Active learning (AL) methods optimize data acquisition but overlook interpretability of acquired samples. We propose a dual-framework solution: Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning (EGxFSL) and Explainability-Guided AL (xGAL). EGxFSL integrates radiologist-defined regions-of-interest as spatial supervision via Grad-CAM-based Dice loss, jointly optimized with prototypical classification for interpretable few-shot learning. xGAL introduces iterative sample acquisition prioritizing both predictive uncertainty and attention misalignment, creating a closed-loop framework where explainability guides training and sample selection synergistically. On the BraTS (MRI), VinDr-CXR (chest X-ray), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-ray) datasets, we achieve accuracies of 92\%, 76\%, and 62\%, respectively, consistently outperforming non-guided baselines across all datasets. Under severe data constraints, xGAL achieves 76\% accuracy with only 680 samples versus 57\% for random sampling. Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrate guided models focus on diagnostically relevant regions, with generalization validated on breast ultrasound confirming cross-modality applicability.

### [3] [MIAR: Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation Fuison for Multimodal Emotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02414)
*Jichao Zhu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIAR, a novel multimodal emotion recognition method, improves performance by addressing modal fusion challenges like distribution differences and varying contributions, using feature interaction and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous MER methods lacked effective handling of modal distribution differences, varying modal contributions, and generalization across textual features, limiting performance.

Method: MIAR integrates multimodal contextual features via feature interaction to create global representation tokens, aligns modalities with contrastive learning and normalization.

Result: MIAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets.

Conclusion: MIAR effectively addresses modal fusion challenges and enhances MER performance, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) aims to perceive human emotions through three modes: language, vision, and audio. Previous methods primarily focused on modal fusion without adequately addressing significant distributional differences among modalities or considering their varying contributions to the task. They also lacked robust generalization capabilities across diverse textual model features, thus limiting performance in multimodal scenarios. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation (MIAR). This network integrates contextual features across different modalities using a feature interaction to generate feature tokens to represent global representations of this modality extracting information from other modalities. These four tokens represent global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. MIAR aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks: CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets, experimental results demonstrate the MIAR outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods.

### [4] [Watch Wider and Think Deeper: Collaborative Cross-modal Chain-of-Thought for Complex Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02422)
*Wenting Lu,Didi Zhu,Tao Shen,Donglin Zhu,Ayong Ye,Chao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoT framework addresses limitations in multi-modal reasoning by integrating dynamic multi-region grounding and relation-aware reasoning, achieving significant accuracy improvements on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chain-of-Thought methods struggle with coarse-grained image regions and fragmented semantics in cross-modal reasoning.

Method: Introduces Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding for adaptive region detection and Relation-Aware Reasoning for coherent multi-region collaboration.

Result: Achieves accuracy improvements of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoCoT enhances complex visual reasoning and introduces a new dataset (CoCoT-70K) with multi-region annotations.

Abstract: Multi-modal reasoning requires the seamless integration of visual and linguistic cues, yet existing Chain-of-Thought methods suffer from two critical limitations in cross-modal scenarios: (1) over-reliance on single coarse-grained image regions, and (2) semantic fragmentation between successive reasoning steps. To address these issues, we propose the CoCoT (Collaborative Coross-modal Thought) frame- work, built upon two key innovations: a) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect the most relevant image regions based on the question, and b) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration by iteratively align- ing visual cues to form a coherent and logical chain of thought. Through this approach, we construct the CoCoT-70K dataset, comprising 74,691 high-quality samples with multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual rea- soning, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

### [5] [ReCCur: A Recursive Corner-Case Curation Framework for Robust Vision-Language Understanding in Open and Edge Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03011)
*Yihan Wei,Shenghai Yuan,Tianchen Deng,Boyang Lou,Enwen Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCCur is a low-compute framework using a multi-agent pipeline to refine noisy web data into high-precision, auditable labels for corner-case curation with minimal human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Corner cases are critical for real-world robustness but hard to curate due to noisy data, brittle labels, and resource constraints.

Method: Uses a recursive pipeline: data acquisition with VLMs, tri-modal consistency checks, mixture-of-experts voting, and adversarial labeling for validation.

Result: Achieves high-precision labels for corner cases (e.g., flooded cars) on consumer GPUs, improving purity and separability.

Conclusion: ReCCur provides a scalable, practical solution for corner-case curation under resource constraints, benefiting downstream tasks.

Abstract: Corner cases are rare or extreme scenarios that drive real-world failures, but they are difficult to curate at scale: web data are noisy, labels are brittle, and edge deployments preclude large retraining. We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints. Code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: We introduce NitroGen, a vision-action foundation model for generalist gaming agents that is trained on 40,000 hours of gameplay videos across more than 1,000 games. We incorporate three key ingredients: 1) an internet-scale video-action dataset constructed by automatically extracting player actions from publicly available gameplay videos, 2) a multi-game benchmark environment that can measure cross-game generalization, and 3) a unified vision-action model trained with large-scale behavior cloning. NitroGen exhibits strong competence across diverse domains, including combat encounters in 3D action games, high-precision control in 2D platformers, and exploration in procedurally generated worlds. It transfers effectively to unseen games, achieving up to 52% relative improvement in task success rates over models trained from scratch. We release the dataset, evaluation suite, and model weights to advance research on generalist embodied agents.

### [7] [TAP-ViTs: Task-Adaptive Pruning for On-Device Deployment of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02437)
*Zhibo Wang,Zuoyuan Zhang,Xiaoyi Pang,Qile Zhang,Xuanyi Hao,Shuguo Zhuo,Peng Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAP-ViTs introduces a task-adaptive pruning framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that generates device-specific pruned models without requiring local data, addressing privacy and resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods either ignore device heterogeneity or rely on fine-tuning with local data, which is infeasible due to privacy and resource limitations.

Method: TAP-ViTs uses a GMM-based metric dataset construction to infer device-level task characteristics and a dual-granularity pruning strategy for task-aware pruning.

Result: Experiments show TAP-ViTs outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.

Conclusion: TAP-ViTs effectively enables task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision tasks, yet their substantial computational and memory demands hinder efficient deployment on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices. Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.

### [8] [Understanding Pure Textual Reasoning for Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02441)
*Yuan Li,Shin'ya Nishida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how textual reasoning aids Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA), comparing three paradigms to understand their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how textual information impacts BIQA and its ability to represent score-related image content.

Method: Compares BIQA models using three paradigms: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder.

Result: Self-Consistency reduces performance gap between image- and text-based predictions; Autoencoder shows potential.

Conclusion: Findings offer insights for enhancing textual reasoning in BIQA and high-level vision tasks.

Abstract: Textual reasoning has recently been widely adopted in Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA). However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization. These findings provide insights into how to improve the textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks.

### [9] [Evaluating the Diagnostic Classification Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models: Insights from the Osteoarthritis Initiative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02443)
*Li Wang,Xi Chen,XiangWen Deng,HuaHui Yi,ZeKun Jiang,Kang Li,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well in medical VQA and report generation but struggle with disease-specific classification, as shown in knee osteoarthritis radiograph analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate MLLMs' performance on underrepresented knee OA classification, impacting millions worldwide, and identify effective components for diagnostic accuracy.

Method: The research involved systematic ablation studies on vision encoders, connectors, and LLMs across training strategies, comparing classification accuracy and fine-tuning impacts.

Result: A trained vision encoder alone outperformed full MLLM pipelines, and LoRA fine-tuning on balanced small datasets yielded better results than larger imbalanced ones.

Conclusion: For medical classification tasks requiring high certainty, optimizing vision encoders and curating balanced datasets is more effective than relying on full MLLM pipelines.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promising performance on medical visual question answering (VQA) and report generation, but these generation and explanation abilities do not reliably transfer to disease-specific classification. We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty. We recommend prioritizing vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation when developing clinically applicable systems.

### [10] [Don't Mind the Gaps: Implicit Neural Representations for Resolution-Agnostic Retinal OCT Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02447)
*Bennet Kahrs,Julia Andresen,Fenja Falta,Monty Santarossa,Heinz Handels,Timo Kepp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two frameworks using implicit neural representations (INRs) for 3D retinal OCT analysis, addressing anisotropy issues and enabling resolution-agnostic evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical OCT imaging produces anisotropic data, leading to inconsistent 2D analyses. INRs offer a solution for continuous, resolution-agnostic representations.

Method: Two INR-based frameworks: inter-B-scan interpolation with en-face modalities and a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas.

Result: Improved retinal shape representation and predictions for unseen cases, facilitating volumetric analysis of OCT images.

Conclusion: The frameworks enhance 3D retinal OCT analysis, enabling broader evaluation of retinal structures despite large B-scan distances.

Abstract: Routine clinical imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed with large slice spacing, resulting in highly anisotropic images and a sparsely scanned retina. Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases. Our resolution-independent frameworks facilitate the analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, opening up possibilities for the volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.

### [11] [PatchAlign3D: Local Feature Alignment for Dense 3D Shape understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02457)
*Souhail Hadgi,Bingchen Gong,Ramana Sundararaman,Emery Pierson,Lei Li,Peter Wonka,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D encoder-only model that aligns language with patch-level features from point clouds, enabling efficient zero-shot 3D part segmentation without multi-view rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for 3D shapes struggle with local part-level reasoning and rely on costly multi-view rendering and LLM prompts. This work aims to leverage inherent 3D geometry for better performance.

Method: A point cloud transformer encoder is pre-trained in two stages: (1) distilling dense 2D features into 3D patches and (2) aligning patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings using multi-positive contrastive learning.

Result: The model achieves superior zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference, outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D encoder effectively bridges the gap in local part-level reasoning for 3D shapes, offering efficient and high-performance solutions without relying on multi-view rendering.

Abstract: Current foundation models for 3D shapes excel at global tasks (retrieval, classification) but transfer poorly to local part-level reasoning. Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

### [12] [CT Scans As Video: Efficient Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Using Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02521)
*Amirreza Parvahan,Mohammad Hoseyni,Javad Khoramdel,Amirhossein Nikoofard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a lightweight framework for 3D medical imaging analysis on edge devices by treating CT scans as video streams, improving detection precision for Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high memory and computational demands of 3D CNNs in automated medical imaging analysis on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Reformulates CT data as video streams, uses YOLO Nano architectures for slice-level detection, employs ByteTrack for anatomical consistency, and introduces hybrid inference with a spatiotemporal filter.

Result: Increases detection precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to baseline 2D detectors, while maintaining high sensitivity.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-limited settings like mobile stroke units and remote clinics.

Abstract: Automated analysis of volumetric medical imaging on edge devices is severely constrained by the high memory and computational demands of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.

*Shaden Shaar,Bradon Thymes,Sirawut Chaixanien,Claire Cardie,Bharath Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MovieRecapsQA, an open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark using movie recap videos, evaluating multimodal reasoning in videos with free-form answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoQA benchmarks lack open-ended questions and multimodal reasoning, motivating the creation of MovieRecapsQA to address these gaps.

Method: MovieRecapsQA uses recap videos and summaries to generate 8.2K QA pairs with aligned subtitles, providing reference-free facts for evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of seven MLLMs shows visual-only questions are hardest, models prefer text inputs, and all struggle with factual accuracy in videos.

Conclusion: MovieRecapsQA advances VideoQA by enabling open-ended, multimodal evaluation, revealing challenges in visual understanding and factual accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding real-world videos such as movies requires integrating visual and dialogue cues to answer complex questions. Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary "facts" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.

### [14] [Shallow- and Deep-fake Image Manipulation Localization Using Vision Mamba and Guided Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02566)
*Junbin Zhang,Hamid Reza Tohidypour,Yixiao Wang,Panos Nasiopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning method using Vision Mamba and Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) to localize manipulations in both shallowfake and deepfake images, achieving higher accuracy than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image manipulation localization is crucial due to societal impacts of forged images. Existing methods focus on either shallowfakes or deepfakes, leaving a gap for a unified approach.

Method: The approach combines Vision Mamba for feature extraction and G-GNN to enhance differentiation between manipulated and authentic pixels.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in inference accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively localizes manipulations in both shallowfake and deepfake images, demonstrating its feasibility and superiority.

Abstract: Image manipulation localization is a critical research task, given that forged images may have a significant societal impact of various aspects. Such image manipulations can be produced using traditional image editing tools (known as "shallowfakes") or advanced artificial intelligence techniques ("deepfakes"). While numerous studies have focused on image manipulation localization on either shallowfake images or deepfake videos, few approaches address both cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a deep learning network to localize manipulations in both shallow- and deep-fake images, and proposed a solution for such purpose. To precisely differentiate between authentic and manipulated pixels, we leverage the Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe the boundaries between tampered and untouched regions. To further enhance this separation, we propose a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module that amplifies the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels. Our evaluation results show that our proposed method achieved higher inference accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

### [15] [DreamLoop: Controllable Cinemagraph Generation from a Single Photograph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02646)
*Aniruddha Mahapatra,Long Mai,Cusuh Ham,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamLoop is a framework for generating cinemagraphs from single photos using a video diffusion model, enabling flexible and intuitive control without needing cinemagraph training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for creating cinemagraphs are limited to simple motions and narrow domains, while general video diffusion models lack specialized data for seamless, controlled loops.

Method: DreamLoop adapts a video diffusion model with two objectives: temporal bridging (ensuring smooth loops) and motion conditioning (user control over animation). The input image is used as the first and last frame for seamless looping, and static tracks maintain background stability.

Result: DreamLoop produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing methods in flexibility and quality.

Conclusion: DreamLoop is the first method to enable general cinemagraph generation with intuitive controls, demonstrating superior results compared to current approaches.

Abstract: Cinemagraphs, which combine static photographs with selective, looping motion, offer unique artistic appeal. Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches.

### [16] [GRRE: Leveraging G-Channel Removed Reconstruction Error for Robust Detection of AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02709)
*Shuman He,Xiehua Li,Xioaju Yang,Yang Xiong,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRRE, a method detecting AI-generated images by analyzing G-channel removal reconstruction errors, showing strong generalization and robustness across unseen models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distinguishing synthetic images from real ones is increasingly difficult due to advances in generative models like diffusion models and GANs. Existing detection methods struggle with generalization, especially on unseen models.

Method: The proposed GRRE method removes the green (G) channel from images and measures reconstruction errors, leveraging discrepancies between real and AI-generated images for detection.

Result: GRRE achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including unseen ones, and maintains robustness against perturbations and post-processing.

Conclusion: GRRE demonstrates the effectiveness of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a forensic tool for detecting AI-generated images, offering superior cross-model generalization.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, particularly diffusion models and GANs, has greatly increased the difficulty of distinguishing synthetic images from real ones. Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization. These results highlight the potential of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a powerful forensic tool for safeguarding image authenticity in the era of generative AI.

*Taeyeon Kim,Youngju Na,Jumin Lee,Minhyuk Sung,Sung-Eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMO is a novel framework for transferring motion from 2D videos to 3D assets without category-specific templates or explicit 3D supervision, using articulated Gaussian splatting and semantic correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in transferring motion from 2D videos to 3D assets due to pose ambiguities and diverse object shapes, which typically require category-specific templates.

Method: CAMO uses a morphology-parameterized articulated 3D Gaussian splatting model and dense semantic correspondences to adapt shape and pose through optimization.

Result: CAMO achieves superior motion accuracy, efficiency, and visual coherence compared to existing methods, addressing shape-pose ambiguities effectively.

Conclusion: CAMO advances motion transfer for diverse object categories and casual video scenarios, eliminating the need for predefined templates.

Abstract: Motion transfer from 2D videos to 3D assets is a challenging problem, due to inherent pose ambiguities and diverse object shapes, often requiring category-specific parametric templates. We propose CAMO, a category-agnostic framework that transfers motion to diverse target meshes directly from monocular 2D videos without relying on predefined templates or explicit 3D supervision. The core of CAMO is a morphology-parameterized articulated 3D Gaussian splatting model combined with dense semantic correspondences to jointly adapt shape and pose through optimization. This approach effectively alleviates shape-pose ambiguities, enabling visually faithful motion transfer for diverse categories. Experimental results demonstrate superior motion accuracy, efficiency, and visual coherence compared to existing methods, significantly advancing motion transfer in varied object categories and casual video scenarios.

### [18] [Robust Mesh Saliency GT Acquisition in VR via View Cone Sampling and Geometric Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02721)
*Guoquan Zheng,Jie Hao,Huiyu Duan,Yongming Han,Liang Yuan,Dong Zhang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust framework is proposed for accurate 3D mesh saliency ground truth acquisition in VR, addressing limitations of current methods by introducing view cone sampling and hybrid diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D mesh saliency GT methods mimic 2D techniques, ignoring 3D topology differences, and face issues like texture attention and signal leakage.

Method: Introduces view cone sampling (VCS) for robust sampling and hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) for topologically-consistent saliency propagation.

Result: Mitigates topological short-circuits and aliasing, providing a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition aligned with human perception.

Conclusion: The framework offers a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.

Abstract: Reliable 3D mesh saliency ground truth (GT) is essential for human-centric visual modeling in virtual reality (VR). However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating "topological short-circuits" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.

### [19] [Foreground-Aware Dataset Distillation via Dynamic Patch Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02727)
*Longzhen Li,Guang Li,Ren Togo,Keisuke Maeda,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a foreground-aware dataset distillation method that dynamically selects patches based on foreground occupancy, improving distillation performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dataset distillation methods face issues like high computational costs, unrealistic outputs, and limited generalization. Non-optimization methods using rigid patch selection often discard critical object information. The paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The method uses Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and computes per-image foreground occupancy. A category-wise patch decision threshold is derived, guiding a dynamic patch selection strategy. This strategy either selects the most informative patch or resizes the full image if the foreground dominates.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method's superiority, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets while enhancing robustness across architectures and image compositions.

Conclusion: The proposed foreground-aware distillation method outperforms existing approaches by preserving key object information and reducing redundant background content.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a foreground-aware dataset distillation method that enhances patch selection in a content-adaptive manner. With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.

*Xuchang Zhong,Xu Cao,Jinke Feng,Hao Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel homography-guided pose estimator network improves visual localization accuracy and training efficiency by leveraging geometric priors and homography constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regression-based methods for visual localization on SD maps ignore geometric priors, leading to inefficient training and limited accuracy.

Method: The proposed framework projects ground-view features into the BEV domain, enforces semantic alignment with map features, and uses homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict pose outputs.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrating improved accuracy and flexibility.

Conclusion: The unified BEV semantic reasoning and homography learning framework enhances visual localization, supports cross-resolution inputs, and will be released publicly for future research.

Abstract: Visual localization on standard-definition (SD) maps has emerged as a promising low-cost and scalable solution for autonomous driving. However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling homography transformations, the proposed framework naturally supports cross-resolution inputs, enhancing model flexibility. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods. Code and pretrained models will be publicly released to foster future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in functional imaging, specifically PET, revealing a 'functional perception gap' and introducing PET-Bench for evaluation. It identifies 'CoT hallucination' issues and proposes AVA to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored capability of MLLMs in functional imaging and their failure to decode functional tracer biodistribution without morphological priors.

Method: Introduces PET-Bench, evaluates 19 MLLMs, identifies CoT hallucination, and proposes Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA) for fine-tuning.

Result: AVA bridges the perception gap, transforms CoT into a reliable tool, and increases diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

Conclusion: AVA effectively resolves the functional perception gap and enhances MLLMs' diagnostic reliability in PET imaging.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as abnormality detection and report generation for anatomical modalities, their capability in functional imaging remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tiny object detection is crucial in remote sensing, but current Transformer-based detectors struggle with slow convergence and poor query-object matching due to limited pixel data and varying object density.

Method: The proposed D$^3$R-DETR refines low-level features by combining spatial and frequency domain information to predict accurate object density maps, enhancing localization of tiny objects.

Result: Experiments on AI-TOD-v2 show D$^3$R-DETR surpasses state-of-the-art detectors in tiny object detection.

Conclusion: D$^3$R-DETR effectively addresses challenges in tiny object detection, proving its superiority through improved performance metrics.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects plays a vital role in remote sensing intelligent interpretation, as these objects often carry critical information for downstream applications. However, due to the extremely limited pixel information and significant variations in object density, mainstream Transformer-based detectors often suffer from slow convergence and inaccurate query-object matching. To address these challenges, we propose D$^3$R-DETR, a novel DETR-based detector with Dual-Domain Density Refinement. By fusing spatial and frequency domain information, our method refines low-level feature maps and utilizes their rich details to predict more accurate object density map, thereby guiding the model to precisely localize tiny objects. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD-v2 dataset demonstrate that D$^3$R-DETR outperforms existing state-of-the-art detectors for tiny object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing deep learning-based methods, such as poor generalization and dataset-specific tuning requirements.

Method: Uses geometric bootstrapping, farthest point sampling, and coordinate normalization with hierarchical multi-scale matching. BUFFER-X-Lite adds early exit and fast pose solvers.

Result: Achieves effective zero-shot generalization across 12 diverse datasets without manual tuning. BUFFER-X-Lite reduces computation by 43%.

Conclusion: BUFFER-X and BUFFER-X-Lite provide robust, efficient point cloud registration solutions applicable across varied environments.

Abstract: Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy. We evaluate on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations. Results demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively without manual tuning or prior knowledge of test domains. Code: https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/BUFFER-X.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current monocular depth estimation methods, which rely on large datasets and complex decoders, by proposing a more efficient and generalizable solution.

Method: Uses DINOv3 for dense feature extraction and introduces SDT, a compact transformer-based decoder with single-path feature fusion, reducing parameters by 85%-89%. Also employs a quality-based filtering strategy to enhance training data.

Result: Outperforms DPT in accuracy on five benchmarks, demonstrating improved efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the balance between model design and data quality for efficient and generalizable zero-shot depth estimation.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to recover the depth information of 3D scenes from 2D images. Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy. This work highlights the importance of balancing model design and data quality for achieving efficient and generalizable zero-shot depth estimation. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/AnyDepth.

TL;DR: ClearAIR is a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception, using a hierarchical strategy for better image restoration by combining MLLM-based IQA, region awareness, and internal clue reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AiOIR approaches often rely on degradation-specific representations, leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. ClearAIR aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging Human Visual Perception principles.

Method: ClearAIR uses a Multimodal Large Language Model-based IQA for overall evaluation, a region awareness and task recognition pipeline for coarse restoration, and an internal clue reuse mechanism for fine details.

Result: ClearAIR outperforms existing methods on diverse synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior restoration performance.

Conclusion: ClearAIR provides a robust, hierarchical solution for AiOIR, effectively addressing complex degradations with improved detail recovery.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has advanced significantly, offering promising solutions for complex real-world degradations. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration. Experimental results show that ClearAIR achieves superior performance across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: AbductiveMLLM improves visual abductive reasoning in AI by mimicking human dual-mode cognition, combining verbal and pictorial abduction via REASONER and IMAGINER components, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack strong abductive inference capabilities compared to humans. The paper aims to bridge this gap by emulating human verbal-pictorial abduction interplay.

Method: Introduces AbductiveMLLM with REASONER (verbal domain) and IMAGINER (pictorial thinking). REASONER prunes incongruent hypotheses, while IMAGINER enriches grounding via text-to-image diffusion. Trained end-to-end.

Result: AbductiveMLLM outperforms traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs on standard VAR benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Mimicking human dual-mode cognition enhances MLLMs' abductive reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining verbal and pictorial approaches.

Abstract: Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to "imagine" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show that AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.

Method: Proposes EarthVLNet, a semantic-guided network, and EarthVLSet, a multi-task dataset with 10.9k images and 761.5k textual pairs. Uses land-cover segmentation and LLM-guided relational reasoning for VQA tasks.

Result: Superior performance in semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA tasks. Key findings highlight segmentation's role in VQA, sensitivity of tasks to vision encoders, and need for advanced encoders/decoders.

Conclusion: EarthVLNet and EarthVLSet provide a benchmark connecting image-mask-text, advancing Earth vision for geographical applications and suggesting future research directions.

Abstract: Earth vision has achieved milestones in geospatial object recognition but lacks exploration in object-relational reasoning, limiting comprehensive scene understanding. To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance. We believe this dataset and method will provide a beneficial benchmark that connects ''image-mask-text'', advancing geographical applications for Earth vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamStyle is a unified framework supporting text-, image-, and first-frame-guided video stylization using LoRA training and high-quality datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video stylization methods are limited to single-condition styles and suffer from style inconsistency due to lack of quality datasets.

Method: DreamStyle uses a vanilla I2V model with LoRA training and token-specific up matrices to reduce condition confusion, paired with curated datasets.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show DreamStyle excels in style consistency and video quality across all stylization tasks.

Conclusion: DreamStyle effectively addresses limitations of single-condition methods and dataset quality, offering superior performance in video stylization.

Abstract: Video stylization, an important downstream task of video generation models, has not yet been thoroughly explored. Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces StableDPT, a method to enhance video depth estimation by integrating a temporal module into existing models, improving accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular depth estimation models struggle with temporal instability and flickering artifacts when applied to videos. The goal is to adapt these models for video processing while maintaining efficiency.

Method: StableDPT modifies the DPT head with temporal layers using cross-attention to leverage global context from keyframes. It also introduces an efficient inference strategy for arbitrary video lengths.

Result: The method achieves better temporal consistency, competitive performance, and faster processing (2x speedup) compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: StableDPT effectively addresses temporal instability in video depth estimation, offering a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Applying single image Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models to video sequences introduces significant temporal instability and flickering artifacts. We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate improved temporal consistency, competitive state-of-the-art performance and on top 2x faster processing in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel topology-aware framework for virtual H&E-to-IHC staining addresses spatial misalignment and local deformations in weakly-paired data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHC staining is crucial for cancer diagnosis but is complex, time-consuming, and expensive. Virtual staining offers a cost-effective alternative, but weakly-paired data with misalignment issues hinder its effectiveness.

Method: The proposed framework includes a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism using graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations, and a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism to align pathological regions based on node importance.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmarks across four staining tasks, achieving superior generation quality and clinical relevance.

Conclusion: The topology-aware framework effectively addresses the challenges of weakly-paired data in virtual staining, offering a promising solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining provides crucial molecular characterization of tissue samples and plays an indispensable role in the clinical examination and diagnosis of cancers. However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across four staining tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior generation quality with higher clinical relevance.

### [31] [SketchThinker-R1: Towards Efficient Sketch-Style Reasoning in Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02825)
*Ruiyang Zhang,Dongzhan Zhou,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchThinker-R1 introduces sketch-style reasoning in multimodal models to reduce computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, achieving a 64% reduction in token costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspiration comes from human cognitive efficiency, where sketch-style reasoning prioritizes salient information for faster problem-solving.

Method: The approach involves three stages: Sketch-Mode Cold Start (converting long reasoning to sketch-style), SketchJudge Reward Model (evaluating reasoning quality), and Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning (generalizing sketch-style reasoning).

Result: Experiments show a 64% reduction in token costs without accuracy loss, with qualitative evidence of better focus on key cues.

Conclusion: SketchThinker-R1 successfully enhances efficiency in large multimodal models by adopting sketch-style reasoning.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of extensive, step-by-step reasoning in large multimodal models, long reasoning processes inevitably incur substantial computational overhead, i.e., in terms of higher token costs and increased response time, which undermines inference efficiency. In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.

TL;DR: DGA-Net introduces depth prompting and modules (CGE, AGR) to enhance camouflaged object detection by integrating RGB and depth data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage depth cues effectively in Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) by addressing the limitations of sparse prompts in existing approaches.

Method: Proposes DGA-Net with Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) for RGB-depth fusion and Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) to maintain feature integrity across layers.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative results show DGA-Net surpasses state-of-the-art COD techniques.

Conclusion: DGA-Net's innovative modules and depth prompting significantly improve COD performance.

Abstract: To fully exploit depth cues in Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), we present DGA-Net, a specialized framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM) via a novel ``depth prompting" paradigm. Distinguished from existing approaches that primarily rely on sparse prompts (e.g., points or boxes), our method introduces a holistic mechanism for constructing and propagating dense depth prompts. Specifically, we propose a Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) module that synthesizes RGB semantics and depth geometric within a heterogeneous graph to form a unified guidance signal. Furthermore, we design an Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) module. To counteract the inherent information decay in feature hierarchies, AGR forges a global anchor and establishes direct non-local pathways to broadcast this guidance from deep to shallow layers, ensuring precise and consistent segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DGA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art COD methods.

TL;DR: SEF-DETR improves infrared small target detection by refining query initialization with frequency-guided patch screening, dynamic embedding enhancement, and reliability-consistency-aware fusion, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DETR-based detectors struggle with IRSTD due to background features overwhelming target-relevant embeddings in self-attention.

Method: Proposes SEF-DETR with three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF) to refine queries.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public IRSTD datasets, demonstrating robust detection.

Conclusion: SEF-DETR provides an efficient and effective solution for infrared small target detection by addressing query initialization issues.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small target size, and complex cluttered backgrounds. Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability. Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets demonstrate that SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering a robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection task.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for universal image segmentation is introduced, achieving agnostic segmentation holistically without mask dependence. Key adaptations improve performance, though it doesn't yet surpass mask-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable universal image segmentation without relying on mask-based frameworks, offering holistic prediction and unique capabilities like ambiguity modeling.

Method: Uses diffusion models with adaptations like a location-aware palette, 2D gray code ordering, tanh activation, and sigmoid loss weighting. Settles on x-prediction.

Result: Narrows the performance gap with mask-based models but doesn't surpass them yet. Introduces principled ambiguity modeling, a unique capability.

Conclusion: Proposed improvements show promise; combining them with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could yield competitive models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for universal image segmentation, making agnostic segmentation possible without depending on mask-based frameworks and instead predicting the full segmentation in a holistic manner. We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TA-Prompting to improve VideoLLMs by using Temporal Anchors for precise event localization and temporal-aware captioning, enhancing dense video captioning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs struggle with precise event boundary identification in untrimmed videos, leading to ungrounded captions.

Method: TA-Prompting employs Temporal Anchors for accurate event localization and introduces an event coherent sampling strategy for caption selection.

Result: TA-Prompting outperforms state-of-the-art VideoLLMs on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves temporal localization and caption coherence in dense video captioning.

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to interpret and describe all temporally localized events throughout an input video. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zoom-IQA is a VLM-based IQA model that improves robustness and explainability by emulating cognitive behaviors like uncertainty awareness and region reasoning, using a two-stage training pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based IQA methods struggle with unreliable reasoning due to poor integration of visual and textual cues.

Method: Zoom-IQA uses a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on the GR-IQA dataset for grounding assessments, and reinforcement learning stabilized by KL-Coverage regularizer and Progressive Re-sampling Strategy.

Result: Zoom-IQA shows improved robustness, explainability, and generalization, with effectiveness demonstrated in downstream tasks like image restoration.

Conclusion: Zoom-IQA advances IQA by combining cognitive behaviors with a structured training approach, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. The application to downstream tasks, such as image restoration, further demonstrates the effectiveness of Zoom-IQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCG-ReID proposes dynamic disentangling and scenario-specific fusion strategies for multi-modal vehicle ReID, addressing conflicts in balanced and unbalanced modality quality distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address conflicting fusion needs for balanced and unbalanced modality quality distributions, hindering intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity decoupling.

Method: Introduces DCDW for dynamic modal weighting, CFM for balanced distributions, and GFM for unbalanced distributions to enhance fusion and discriminative feature mining.

Result: Validated on three benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100), showing effectiveness in improving multi-modal ReID performance.

Conclusion: DCG-ReID successfully disentangles and fuses multi-modal data with distinct quality distributions, advancing vehicle ReID accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Multi-modal vehicle Re-Identification (ReID) aims to leverage complementary information from RGB, Near Infrared (NIR), and Thermal Infrared (TIR) modalities to retrieve the same vehicle. The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of our method. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrismVAU is a lightweight system for real-time Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) that uses a single MLLM for anomaly scoring and explanation, avoiding costly annotations and complex pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAU methods are costly and complex, requiring fine-tuned models or external modules. PrismVAU aims to simplify this while maintaining performance.

Method: PrismVAU employs a coarse anomaly scoring module and an MLLM-based refinement module, optimized with Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) for textual anchors and prompts.

Result: The system achieves competitive detection performance and provides interpretable explanations without needing fine-tuning or dense processing.

Conclusion: PrismVAU is efficient and practical for real-world VAU applications, balancing performance and simplicity.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) extends traditional Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) by not only localizing anomalies but also describing and reasoning about their context. Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridSolarNet, a lightweight solar panel fault detection model combining EfficientNet-B0 and CBAM, achieves high accuracy (92.37%) and speed (54.9 FPS) for UAV-based monitoring, outperforming baselines like VGG19 while avoiding accuracy leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual solar panel inspections are inefficient; deep learning models exist but often lack edge compatibility or suffer from biased accuracy due to poor learning techniques.

Method: Proposed HybridSolarNet integrates EfficientNet-B0 with CBAM, uses focal loss and cosine annealing, and avoids accuracy leakage via split-before-augmentation on a Kaggle dataset.

Result: Achieves 92.37% accuracy (±0.41) and 0.9226 F1-score (±0.39), requires only 16.3 MB storage (32x smaller than VGG19), and runs at 54.9 FPS with GPU support.

Conclusion: HybridSolarNet is efficient and accurate for real-time UAV-based solar panel fault detection, validated by ablation studies and Grad-CAM visualizations.

Abstract: Manual inspections for solar panel systems are a tedious, costly, and error-prone task, making it desirable for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based monitoring. Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation. Moreover, visualization obtained from Grad-CAM illustrates that HybridSolarNet focuses on actual locations instead of irrelevant ones.

Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce and digital fashion, image-based virtual try-on (VTON) has attracted increasing attention. However, existing VTON models often suffer from artifacts such as garment distortion and body inconsistency, highlighting the need for reliable quality evaluation of VTON-generated images. To this end, we construct VTONQA, the first multi-dimensional quality assessment dataset specifically designed for VTON, which contains 8,132 images generated by 11 representative VTON models, along with 24,396 mean opinion scores (MOSs) across three evaluation dimensions (i.e., clothing fit, body compatibility, and overall quality). Based on VTONQA, we benchmark both VTON models and a diverse set of image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, revealing the limitations of existing methods and highlighting the value of the proposed dataset. We believe that the VTONQA dataset and corresponding benchmarks will provide a solid foundation for perceptually aligned evaluation, benefiting both the development of quality assessment methods and the advancement of VTON models.

Result: Extensive experiments show LAMS-Edit effectively balances content preservation and edit application.

Conclusion: LAMS-Edit provides a robust framework for precise text-to-image editing, integrating inversion and generation processes.

Abstract: Text-to-Image editing using diffusion models faces challenges in balancing content preservation with edit application and handling real-image editing. To address these, we propose LAMS-Edit, leveraging intermediate states from the inversion process--an essential step in real-image editing--during edited image generation. Specifically, latent representations and attention maps from both processes are combined at each step using weighted interpolation, controlled by a scheduler. This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMS-Edit effectively balances content preservation and edit application.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel comic reasoning framework for CVQA, addressing limitations of standard CoT prompting in small MLLMs, improving performance across humor-centric and abstract visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CoT prompting underperforms in CVQA due to state entanglement, spurious transitions, and inefficiency, especially in small models. The goal is to enhance reasoning fidelity and transferability.

Method: Proposes a comic reasoning framework combining modular CoT generation, GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning, and a structured reward.

Result: The 3B model outperforms SOTA methods on five benchmarks, with plug-in experiments showing a 12.1% average improvement across MLLMs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses CVQA challenges, offering scalable improvements for small MLLMs in humor and abstract reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Comic-based visual question answering (CVQA) poses distinct challenges to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to its reliance on symbolic abstraction, narrative logic, and humor, which differ from conventional VQA tasks. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation. Across five challenging benchmarks, our 3B model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and plug-in experiments yield an additional average improvement of $\mathbf{12.1\%}$ across different MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RiSe introduces risk-aware feature selection for VICP, reducing bandwidth by focusing on critical regions via PTCM and IDAPM, achieving efficient communication without losing detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VICP methods inefficiently transmit redundant features from non-critical areas, wasting bandwidth. Addressing this inefficiency while maintaining perception performance motivates RiSe.

Method: RiSe combines PTCM for kinematic risk assessment and IDAPM for predicting key BEV areas, enabling selective feature transmission from high-interaction regions.

Result: RiSe reduces communication volume to 0.71% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy on DeepAccident.

Conclusion: RiSe establishes a competitive balance between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance, setting a new standard for VICP frameworks.

Abstract: Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative Perception (VICP) is pivotal for resolving occlusion in autonomous driving, yet the trade-off between communication bandwidth and feature redundancy remains a critical bottleneck. While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser. Extensive experiments on the DeepAccident dataset demonstrate that our method reduces communication volume to 0.71\% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.

TL;DR: SA-ResGS improves uncertainty quantification and supervision in next-best-view selection for active scene reconstruction via self-augmented point clouds and residual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To stabilize uncertainty quantification and enhance supervision in next-best-view selection, addressing challenges like sparse and wide-baseline views.

Method: Uses self-augmented point clouds from triangulation and introduces residual learning for 3D Gaussian Splatting, combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstruction quality and view selection robustness.

Conclusion: SA-ResGS effectively improves scene coverage, training stability, and uncertainty estimation, mitigating challenges in wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity.

Abstract: We propose Self-Augmented Residual 3D Gaussian Splatting (SA-ResGS), a novel framework to stabilize uncertainty quantification and enhancing uncertainty-aware supervision in next-best-view (NBV) selection for active scene reconstruction. SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning. Experiments on active view selection demonstrate that SA-ResGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness.

*Ali Kashefi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel frameworks Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet predict fluid flow on irregular geometries using PointNet, avoiding noise artifacts and simplifying architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing methods (e.g., noise artifacts, reliance on auxiliary networks) for predicting fluid flow on irregular geometries.

Method: Incorporates PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models to directly operate on point-cloud representations.

Result: More accurate predictions of velocity, pressure fields, and forces, with greater robustness to incomplete geometries.

Conclusion: The frameworks outperform vanilla PointNet, offering simplicity and improved accuracy.

Abstract: We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.

### [47] [Motion Blur Robust Wheat Pest Damage Detection with Dynamic Fuzzy Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03046)
*Han Zhang,Yanwei Wang,Fang Li,Hongjun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFRCP enhances YOLOv11 for robust object detection in motion-blurred images by integrating dynamic fuzzy features and adaptive switches, achieving higher accuracy with practical edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur degrades object detection; existing methods either lose structure or increase latency.

Method: DFRCP combines multiscale features, introduces Dynamic Robust Switch units, and synthesizes fuzzy features via rotation and interpolation.

Result: Achieves ~10.4% higher accuracy on blurred test sets with minimal training overhead.

Conclusion: DFRCP is effective for blur-robust detection and practical for edge devices.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake produces ghosting artifacts that substantially degrade edge side object detection. Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection.

### [48] [On the Intrinsic Limits of Transformer Image Embeddings in Non-Solvable Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03048)
*Siyi Lyu,Quan Liu,Feng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTs are strong in semantic recognition but struggle with spatial reasoning due to intrinsic architectural limits, proven by computational complexity theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why ViTs fail in spatial tasks like mental rotation, proposing it's due to inherent circuit complexity rather than just data scale.

Method: Formalizes spatial understanding as learning group homomorphisms, analyzing computational bounds (e.g., ≃12SO(3)) vs. ViT capabilities (≃12TC0).

Result: ViTs lack the depth to efficiently model non-solvable spatial structures, validated by latent-space probing showing structural collapse.

Conclusion: ViTs' spatial reasoning limits are fundamentally tied to their computational complexity, not just training data.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic recognition but exhibit systematic failures in spatial reasoning tasks such as mental rotation. While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\mathsf{TC^0} \subsetneq \mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. We validate this complexity gap via latent-space probing, demonstrating that ViT representations suffer a structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.

### [49] [IBISAgent: Reinforcing Pixel-Level Visual Reasoning in MLLMs for Universal Biomedical Object Referring and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03054)
*Yankai Jiang,Qiaoru Li,Binlu Xu,Haoran Sun,Chao Ding,Junting Dong,Yuxiang Cai,Xuhong Zhang,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IBISAgent is a novel agentic MLLM that reformulates segmentation as a multi-step decision-making process, outperforming existing methods in medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical MLLMs face challenges like catastrophic forgetting and lack of iterative refinement in segmentation, limiting their generalization and performance.

Method: IBISAgent performs interleaved reasoning and click actions, invokes segmentation tools, and uses a two-stage training framework (supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning) for robust performance.

Result: IBISAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances pixel-level visual reasoning and achieves superior results without architectural changes, with datasets, code, and models set for public release.

Abstract: Recent research on medical MLLMs has gradually shifted its focus from image-level understanding to fine-grained, pixel-level comprehension. Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods. All datasets, code, and trained models will be released publicly.

*Zhen Wang,Jiaojiao Zhao,Qilong Wang,Yongfeng Dong,Wenlong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CFSG improves fine-grained domain generalization by disentangling concept and feature spaces into structured components, achieving significant performance gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained domain generalization faces challenges due to subtle inter-class differences and pronounced intra-class variations, inspired by human cognitive mechanisms.

Method: Proposes Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG) with adaptive mechanisms to dynamically adjust common, specific, and confounding components.

Result: CFSG achieves a 9.87% average improvement over baselines and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.08%.

Conclusion: CFSG effectively integrates multi-granularity structured knowledge, validated by explainability analysis.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Domain Generalization (FGDG) presents greater challenges than conventional domain generalization due to the subtle inter-class differences and relatively pronounced intra-class variations inherent in fine-grained recognition tasks. Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components. In the final prediction, explicit weights are assigned to each pair of components. Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFSG achieves an average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.08%. Additionally, explainability analysis validates that CFSG effectively integrates multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms that feature structuralization facilitates the emergence of concept structuralization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs trained on natural images struggle with cartoon imagery due to exaggerated visuals and narrative-driven contexts.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent LLM framework with visual, language, and critic agents for structured reasoning in cartoon VQA.

Result: Evaluated on Pororo and Simpsons datasets, the framework shows how each agent contributes to predictions, enhancing understanding of multi-agent behavior in cartoon VQA.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses cartoon VQA challenges, demonstrating the value of specialized agents in multimodal inference.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) for stylised cartoon imagery presents challenges, such as interpreting exaggerated visual abstraction and narrative-driven context, which are not adequately addressed by standard large language models (LLMs) trained on natural images. To investigate this issue, a multi-agent LLM framework is introduced, specifically designed for VQA tasks in cartoon imagery. The proposed architecture consists of three specialised agents: visual agent, language agent and critic agent, which work collaboratively to support structured reasoning by integrating visual cues and narrative context. The framework was systematically evaluated on two cartoon-based VQA datasets: Pororo and Simpsons. Experimental results provide a detailed analysis of how each agent contributes to the final prediction, offering a deeper understanding of LLM-based multi-agent behaviour in cartoon VQA and multimodal inference.

*Chenchen Lin,Sanbao Su,Rachel Luo,Yuxiao Chen,Yan Wang,Marco Pavone,Fei Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGIF introduces query-conditioned fusion of vision encoder layers to reduce hallucinations and improve visual grounding in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs underutilize hierarchical visual features and suffer from hallucinations due to reliance on language priors rather than image evidence.

Method: TGIF is a lightweight module that dynamically fuses vision encoder layers based on the query, requiring no updates to the vision encoder.

Result: TGIF improves performance on hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks while maintaining or enhancing results on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench.

Conclusion: Query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion effectively enhances visual grounding and reduces hallucinations in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.

Conclusion: The approach successfully identifies grape leaf diseases with high accuracy, offering a practical tool for farmers through a web application.

Abstract: Plant disease diagnosis is essential to farmers' management choices because plant diseases frequently lower crop yield and product quality. For harvests to flourish and agricultural productivity to boost, grape leaf disease detection is important. The plant disease dataset contains grape leaf diseases total of 9,032 images of four classes, among them three classes are leaf diseases, and the other one is healthy leaves.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture to improve logic-intensive image generation by decoupling reasoning (Thinker) from the image generator (Generator) and using a two-stage training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in image synthesis, generative models struggle with complex reasoning and logic-intensive tasks, creating a gap between reasoning and execution. Closed-source systems outperform open-source models in reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting the need for better executable reasoning.

Method: Unified Thinker separates reasoning (Thinker) from the image generator (Generator). It uses a two-stage training approach: first, building a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then applying reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback.

Result: Unified Thinker significantly enhances both reasoning and image generation quality, as demonstrated in text-to-image generation and image editing tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that executable reasoning, achieved through decoupling and modular upgrades of the reasoning component, is crucial for bridging the reasoning--execution gap in generative models.

Abstract: Despite impressive progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, generative models still struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, exposing a persistent reasoning--execution gap. Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.

Result: LSP-DETR demonstrates strong generalization across tissues and achieves state-of-the-art efficiency, being over five times faster than the next-fastest method.

Conclusion: The proposed LSP-DETR framework offers a scalable and efficient solution for nuclei instance segmentation, significantly advancing computational pathology workflows.

Abstract: Precise and scalable instance segmentation of cell nuclei is essential for computational pathology, yet gigapixel Whole-Slide Images pose major computational challenges. Existing approaches rely on patch-based processing and costly post-processing for instance separation, sacrificing context and efficiency. We introduce LSP-DETR (Local Star Polygon DEtection TRansformer), a fully end-to-end framework that uses a lightweight transformer with linear complexity to process substantially larger images without additional computational cost. Nuclei are represented as star-convex polygons, and a novel radial distance loss function allows the segmentation of overlapping nuclei to emerge naturally, without requiring explicit overlap annotations or handcrafted post-processing. Evaluations on PanNuke and MoNuSeg show strong generalization across tissues and state-of-the-art efficiency, with LSP-DETR being over five times faster than the next-fastest leading method.

Motivation: Diffusion models face computational overhead due to their multi-step inference process, necessitating efficient acceleration techniques.

Method: Introduces DiffBench for automated evaluation and DiffAgent, an LLM-driven agent with a closed-loop workflow combining planning, debugging, and genetic algorithm feedback.

Result: DiffBench provides comprehensive evaluation, and DiffAgent outperforms existing LLMs in generating effective acceleration strategies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of accelerating diffusion models through automated code generation and evaluation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automated acceleration code generation and evaluation. First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements. We provide a detailed explanation of the DiffBench construction and the design principles underlying DiffAgent. Extensive experiments show that DiffBench offers a thorough evaluation of generated codes and that DiffAgent significantly outperforms existing LLMs in producing effective diffusion acceleration strategies.

Conclusion: AnatomiX effectively addresses anatomical grounding challenges in medical imaging, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal medical large language models have shown impressive progress in chest X-ray interpretation but continue to face challenges in spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding.

TL;DR: UniCorn addresses the gap in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) for high-quality generation by introducing a self-improvement framework. It achieves significant improvements in image generation benchmarks while maintaining robust comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discrepancy between UMMs' cross-modal comprehension and generation quality, termed Conduction Aphasia, drives the need for a self-supervised solution like UniCorn.

Method: UniCorn partitions a UMM into Proposer, Solver, and Judge roles, enabling self-play and cognitive pattern reconstruction to enhance generative signals. The UniCycle benchmark validates multimodal coherence.

Result: UniCorn outperforms base models on six benchmarks, achieving SOTA on TIIF (73.8), DPG (86.8), CompBench (88.5), and UniCycle, with substantial gains on WISE (+5.0) and OneIG (+6.5).

Conclusion: UniCorn demonstrates scalable, self-supervised refinement for UMMs, significantly improving generation quality without compromising comprehension.

Abstract: While Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal comprehension, a significant gap persists in their ability to leverage such internal knowledge for high-quality generation. We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video diffusion models lack synchronized audio, missing semantic and emotional cues. LTX-2 aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses an asymmetric dual-stream transformer (14B video, 5B audio) with bidirectional cross-attention, temporal embeddings, and modality-CFG.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence, comparable to proprietary models but more efficient.

Conclusion: LTX-2 demonstrates high-quality, synchronized audiovisual generation efficiently, with open-source availability.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video diffusion models can generate compelling video sequences, yet they remain silent -- missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides. We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements. In our evaluations, the model achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, while delivering results comparable to proprietary models at a fraction of their computational cost and inference time. All model weights and code are publicly released.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a MultiMedia-Agent system for automating complex content creation, addressing limitations of current AIGC models by integrating multimodal inputs and outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGC models lack end-to-end task completion capabilities and struggle with multimodal integration in real-world applications.

Method: Introduces a MultiMedia-Agent with a data generation pipeline, tool library, and metrics for preference alignment, using skill acquisition theory and a two-stage correlation strategy for optimization.

Result: The MultiMedia-Agent outperforms novel models in generating better multimedia content.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively addresses the limitations of current AIGC models and enhances complex content creation.

Abstract: With the advancement of AIGC (AI-generated content) technologies, an increasing number of generative models are revolutionizing fields such as video editing, music generation, and even film production. However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.

TL;DR: InfiniDepth introduces neural implicit fields for depth estimation, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained results through a local implicit decoder, outperforming existing methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth estimation methods are limited to discrete image grids, restricting scalability and geometric detail recovery. InfiniDepth aims to overcome these limitations by using neural implicit fields.

Method: InfiniDepth represents depth as neural implicit fields and employs a local implicit decoder to query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, allowing for arbitrary-resolution depth estimation.

Result: InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, excelling in fine-detail regions and benefiting novel view synthesis with fewer artifacts.

Conclusion: The neural implicit field approach in InfiniDepth advances depth estimation by enabling high-resolution, fine-grained results and improving tasks like novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Existing depth estimation methods are fundamentally limited to predicting depth on discrete image grids. Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural implicit fields. Through a simple yet effective local implicit decoder, we can query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation. To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions. It also benefits the task of novel view synthesis under large viewpoint shifts, producing high-quality results with fewer holes and artifacts.

*Hexiao Lu,Xiaokun Sun,Zeyu Cai,Hao Guo,Ying Tai,Jian Yang,Zhenyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Muses is a training-free method for generating realistic 3D creatures using a skeletal foundation, bypassing part-aware optimization or manual assembly challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations in previous methods that produce unrealistic 3D assets due to intricate part-level manipulation and out-of-domain constraints.

Method: Uses a 3D skeleton-guided pipeline: design, composition, and generation via graph-constrained reasoning, voxel-based assembly, and image-guided texture modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity and textual alignment, with potential for flexible 3D editing.

Conclusion: Muses offers a rational and creative approach to 3D creature generation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We present Muses, the first training-free method for fantastic 3D creature generation in a feed-forward paradigm. Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WearVox is the first benchmark for evaluating voice assistants in realistic wearable scenarios, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on egocentric audio, rapid interactions, and distinguishing device-directed speech. It includes 3,842 multi-channel recordings across diverse tasks and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook the complexities of wearable voice assistants, such as motion-affected audio and rapid micro-interactions. WearVox aims to bridge this gap by providing a realistic evaluation framework.

Method: WearVox comprises 3,842 multi-channel audio recordings collected via AI glasses across five tasks (e.g., QA, speech translation) in various environments. Rich metadata accompanies each recording for nuanced analysis. Leading SLLMs are benchmarked on this dataset.

Result: Real-time SLLMs achieve 29% to 59% accuracy on WearVox, with performance dropping in noisy outdoor settings. Multi-channel audio significantly improves robustness and speech discrimination.

Conclusion: Spatial audio cues are crucial for context-aware voice assistants. WearVox sets a comprehensive standard for advancing wearable voice AI research.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as AI glasses are transforming voice assistants into always-available, hands-free collaborators that integrate seamlessly with daily life, but they also introduce challenges like egocentric audio affected by motion and noise, rapid micro-interactions, and the need to distinguish device-directed speech from background conversations. Existing benchmarks largely overlook these complexities, focusing instead on clean or generic conversational audio. To bridge this gap, we present WearVox, the first benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate voice assistants in realistic wearable scenarios. WearVox comprises 3,842 multi-channel, egocentric audio recordings collected via AI glasses across five diverse tasks including Search-Grounded QA, Closed-Book QA, Side-Talk Rejection, Tool Calling, and Speech Translation, spanning a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments and acoustic conditions. Each recording is accompanied by rich metadata, enabling nuanced analysis of model performance under real-world constraints. We benchmark leading proprietary and open-source speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) and find that most real-time SLLMs achieve accuracies on WearVox ranging from 29% to 59%, with substantial performance degradation on noisy outdoor audio, underscoring the difficulty and realism of the benchmark. Additionally, we conduct a case study with two new SLLMs that perform inference with single-channel and multi-channel audio, demonstrating that multi-channel audio inputs significantly enhance model robustness to environmental noise and improve discrimination between device-directed and background speech. Our results highlight the critical importance of spatial audio cues for context-aware voice assistants and establish WearVox as a comprehensive testbed for advancing wearable voice AI research.

*Inpyo Song,Eunji Jeon,Jangwon Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PCEval is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in physical computing, revealing their strengths in code generation but weaknesses in hardware layout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' effectiveness in hardware-constrained environments like physical computing, where their capabilities are underexplored.

Method: Introducing PCEval, a fully automatic benchmark evaluating LLMs in logical and physical aspects of projects, including circuit and code generation.

Result: LLMs excel in code and logical circuit design but struggle with physical breadboard layouts, especially pin connections and circuit errors.

Conclusion: PCEval provides insights into AI assistance in hardware-dependent environments and supports future tool development for physical computing education.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, including software development, education, and technical assistance. Among these, software development is one of the key areas where LLMs are increasingly adopted. However, when hardware constraints are considered-for instance, in physical computing, where software must interact with and control physical hardware -their effectiveness has not been fully explored. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{PCEval} (Physical Computing Evaluation), the first benchmark in physical computing that enables a fully automatic evaluation of the capabilities of LLM in both the logical and physical aspects of the projects, without requiring human assessment. Our evaluation framework assesses LLMs in generating circuits and producing compatible code across varying levels of project complexity. Through comprehensive testing of 13 leading models, \textsc{PCEval} provides the first reproducible and automatically validated empirical assessment of LLMs' ability to reason about fundamental hardware implementation constraints within a simulation environment. Our findings reveal that while LLMs perform well in code generation and logical circuit design, they struggle significantly with physical breadboard layout creation, particularly in managing proper pin connections and avoiding circuit errors. \textsc{PCEval} advances our understanding of AI assistance in hardware-dependent computing environments and establishes a foundation for developing more effective tools to support physical computing education.

*Guibin Zhang,Haiyang Yu,Kaiming Yang,Bingli Wu,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvoRoute addresses the trade-off among performance, cost, and latency in AI agent systems by dynamically selecting optimal LLMs, reducing costs by 80% and latency by 70%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high economic costs and latency of complex AI agent systems highlight a need for balancing performance, cost, and speed.

Method: Introduces EvoRoute, a self-evolving routing paradigm that dynamically selects Pareto-optimal LLMs based on past experience and feedback.

Result: EvoRoute sustains or improves performance while cutting costs by 80% and latency by over 70% in benchmarks like GAIA and BrowseComp+.

Conclusion: EvoRoute effectively dismantles the Agent System Trilemma, offering a scalable solution for efficient AI agent systems.

Abstract: Complex agentic AI systems, powered by a coordinated ensemble of Large Language Models (LLMs), tool and memory modules, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on intricate, multi-turn tasks. However, this success is shadowed by prohibitive economic costs and severe latency, exposing a critical, yet underexplored, trade-off. We formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Agent System Trilemma}: the inherent tension among achieving state-of-the-art performance, minimizing monetary cost, and ensuring rapid task completion. To dismantle this trilemma, we introduce EvoRoute, a self-evolving model routing paradigm that transcends static, pre-defined model assignments. Leveraging an ever-expanding knowledge base of prior experience, EvoRoute dynamically selects Pareto-optimal LLM backbones at each step, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and resource use, while continually refining its own selection policy through environment feedback. Experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks such as GAIA and BrowseComp+ demonstrate that EvoRoute, when integrated into off-the-shelf agentic systems, not only sustains or enhances system performance but also reduces execution cost by up to $80\%$ and latency by over $70\%$.

*Mattia Ottoborgo,Daniele Rege Cambrin,Paolo Garza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a composite objective approach, including a new topological loss, to improve recipe generation by addressing ingredient accuracy, timing, and procedural coherence, outperforming standard training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard training methods for recipe generation focus only on fluency, lacking accuracy in timing, temperature, and ingredient composition. This paper aims to address these gaps.

Method: The study builds on RECIPE-NLG, incorporating composite objectives like a topological loss for ingredient lists (treated as point clouds) and Dice loss for time/temperature precision. Mixed losses are also explored.

Result: The proposed loss improves ingredient- and action-level metrics, Dice loss enhances time/temperature precision, and mixed losses offer synergistic gains. Human preference favors the model in 62% of cases.

Conclusion: Composite objectives, particularly the topological loss, significantly improve recipe generation accuracy and coherence, outperforming traditional cross-entropy-based methods.

Abstract: Cooking recipes are complex procedures that require not only a fluent and factual text, but also accurate timing, temperature, and procedural coherence, as well as the correct composition of ingredients. Standard training procedures are primarily based on cross-entropy and focus solely on fluency. Building on RECIPE-NLG, we investigate the use of several composite objectives and present a new topological loss that represents ingredient lists as point clouds in embedding space, minimizing the divergence between predicted and gold ingredients. Using both standard NLG metrics and recipe-specific metrics, we find that our loss significantly improves ingredient- and action-level metrics. Meanwhile, the Dice loss excels in time/temperature precision, and the mixed loss yields competitive trade-offs with synergistic gains in quantity and time. A human preference analysis supports our finding, showing our model is preferred in 62% of the cases.

*Hyoyeon Lee,Seth Bullock,Conor Houghton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The iterated learning model shows how language transmission constraints lead to structured, expressive, and stable language emergence, even with complex meanings like seven-segment display images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language transmission constraints facilitate the emergence of structured, expressive, and stable languages.

Method: Uses a semi-supervised iterated learning model combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture.

Result: Agents successfully learned and transmitted a language for complex meanings (seven-segment display images) that is expressive, compositional, and stable.

Conclusion: The model effectively demonstrates how language transmission constraints can lead to structured and stable language systems, even with complex meanings.

Abstract: The iterated learning model simulates the transmission of language from generation to generation in order to explore how the constraints imposed by language transmission facilitate the emergence of language structure. Despite each modelled language learner starting from a blank slate, the presence of a bottleneck limiting the number of utterances to which the learner is exposed can lead to the emergence of language that lacks ambiguity, is governed by grammatical rules, and is consistent over successive generations, that is, one that is expressive, compositional and stable. The recent introduction of a more computationally tractable and ecologically valid semi supervised iterated learning model, combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture, has enabled exploration of language transmission dynamics for much larger meaning-signal spaces. Here, for the first time, the model has been successfully applied to a language learning task involving the communication of much more complex meanings: seven-segment display images. Agents in this model are able to learn and transmit a language that is expressive: distinct codes are employed for all 128 glyphs; compositional: signal components consistently map to meaning components, and stable: the language does not change from generation to generation.

### [69] [ModeX: Evaluator-Free Best-of-N Selection for Open-Ended Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02535)
*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Sharon Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ModeX is an evaluator-free framework for selecting high-quality outputs from LLMs by identifying semantic consensus through similarity graphs and spectral clustering, outperforming existing methods in open-ended tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for selecting high-quality LLM outputs rely on external evaluators or exact matches, limiting applicability and efficiency.

Method: ModeX constructs a similarity graph over candidate generations and uses spectral clustering to find dominant semantic consensus. ModeX--Lite adds early pruning for efficiency.

Result: ModeX outperforms single- and multi-path baselines in open-ended tasks like summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: ModeX provides a computationally efficient solution for robust open-ended text generation, removing reliance on external evaluators.

Abstract: Selecting a single high-quality output from multiple stochastic generations remains a fundamental challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in open-ended tasks where no canonical answer exists. While Best-of-N and self-consistency methods show that aggregating multiple generations can improve performance, existing approaches typically rely on external evaluators, reward models, or exact string-match voting, limiting their applicability and efficiency. We propose Mode Extraction (ModeX), an evaluator-free Best-of-N selection framework that generalizes majority voting to open-ended text generation by identifying the modal output representing the dominant semantic consensus among generated texts. ModeX constructs a similarity graph over candidate generations and recursively applies spectral clustering to select a representative centroid, without requiring additional inference or auxiliary models. We further instantiate this selection principle as ModeX--Lite, an improved version of ModeX with early pruning for efficiency. Across open-ended tasks--including text summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning--our approaches consistently outperform standard single- and multi-path baselines, providing a computationally efficient solution for robust open-ended text generation. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/ModeX.

### [70] [Fact-Checking with Large Language Models via Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02574)
*Haoran Wang,Maryam Khalid,Qiong Wu,Jian Gao,Cheng Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PCC framework improves LLM fact-checking by adaptively deciding when to retrieve external evidence based on confidence signals, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce hallucinated responses; current fact-checking methods retrieve evidence indiscriminately, ignoring internal knowledge and adding noise.

Method: Introduces Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC), a framework estimating factual confidence to guide adaptive retrieval or direct answering.

Result: PCC excels in uncertainty quantification, outperforms baselines, and generalizes across LLMs in benchmarks.

Conclusion: PCC enhances fact-checking efficiency and reliability by leveraging confidence-guided retrieval.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring factual accuracy, yet their outputs often contain hallucinated responses. While fact-checking can mitigate these errors, existing methods typically retrieve external evidence indiscriminately, overlooking the model's internal knowledge and potentially introducing irrelevant noise. Moreover, current systems lack targeted mechanisms to resolve specific uncertainties in the model's reasoning. Inspired by how humans fact-check, we argue that LLMs should adaptively decide whether to rely on internal knowledge or initiate retrieval based on their confidence in a given claim. We introduce Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC), a framework that estimates factual confidence by jointly modeling an LLM's probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency. These confidence signals enable an adaptive verification strategy: the model answers directly when confident, triggers targeted retrieval when uncertain or inconsistent, and escalates to deep search when ambiguity is high. Our confidence-guided routing mechanism ensures that retrieval is invoked only when necessary, improving both efficiency and reliability. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks show that PCC achieves better uncertainty quantification than verbalized confidence and consistently outperforms strong LLM-based fact-checking baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCC generalizes well across various LLMs.

TL;DR: DataParasite is an open-source, modular pipeline for scalable online data collection, reducing costs and improving transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing labor-intensive, costly, and opaque data curation processes in computational social science.

Method: Decomposes tabular tasks into entity-level searches using lightweight config files and a shared Python script.

Result: High accuracy and reduced data-collection costs by an order of magnitude compared to manual curation.

Conclusion: DataParasite lowers barriers for scalable, transparent, and reusable data curation.

Abstract: Many questions in computational social science rely on datasets assembled from heterogeneous online sources, a process that is often labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to reproduce. Recent advances in large language models enable agentic search and structured extraction from the web, but existing systems are frequently opaque, inflexible, or poorly suited to scientific data curation. Here we introduce DataParasite, an open-source, modular pipeline for scalable online data collection. DataParasite decomposes tabular curation tasks into independent, entity-level searches defined through lightweight configuration files and executed through a shared, task-agnostic python script. Crucially, the same pipeline can be repurposed to new tasks, including those without predefined entity lists, using only natural-language instructions. We evaluate the pipeline on multiple canonical tasks in computational social science, including faculty hiring histories, elite death events, and political career trajectories. Across tasks, DataParasite achieves high accuracy while reducing data-collection costs by an order of magnitude relative to manual curation. By lowering the technical and labor barriers to online data assembly, DataParasite provides a practical foundation for scalable, transparent, and reusable data curation in computational social science and beyond.

TL;DR: A new method uses LLMs to simulate student responses for IRT parameter estimation, avoiding costly field testing, and shows promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IRT calibration requires expensive field testing, so the study aims to find a cost-effective alternative using LLMs.

Method: Fine-tunes Qwen-3 models with LoRA to simulate student responses, generating synthetic ICCs to estimate IRT parameters.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods, especially in modeling item discrimination, on Grade 6 ELA and BEA 2024 datasets.

Conclusion: The LLM-based approach is a viable alternative for IRT parameter estimation, reducing reliance on field testing.

Abstract: Traditional methods for determining assessment item parameters, such as difficulty and discrimination, rely heavily on expensive field testing to collect student performance data for Item Response Theory (IRT) calibration. This study introduces a novel approach that implicitly models these psychometric properties by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate student responses across a spectrum of latent abilities. Leveraging the Qwen-3 dense model series and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we train models to generate responses to multiple choice questions conditioned on discrete ability descriptors. We reconstruct the probability of a correct response as a function of student ability, effectively generating synthetic Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) to estimate IRT parameters. Evaluation on a dataset of Grade 6 English Language Arts (ELA) items and the BEA 2024 Shared Task dataset demonstrates that this method competes with or outperforms baseline approaches. This simulation-based technique seems particularly effective at modeling item discrimination.

*Kris W Pan,Yongmin Yoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlowPlan-G2P is a structured framework for converting scientific papers into patent descriptions by mimicking expert workflows, outperforming traditional methods in coherence and legal compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of transforming scientific papers into patent descriptions due to differing styles and legal requirements motivates the development of a structured, expert-like approach.

Method: FlowPlan-G2P breaks the task into three stages: Concept Graph Induction, Paragraph and Section Planning, and Graph-Conditioned Generation, leveraging structured reasoning and tailored prompts.

Result: Experiments show FlowPlan-G2P improves logical coherence and legal compliance compared to end-to-end LLM baselines.

Conclusion: The framework sets a new standard for paper-to-patent generation and advances structured text generation in specialized domains.

Abstract: Over 3.5 million patents are filed annually, with drafting patent descriptions requiring deep technical and legal expertise. Transforming scientific papers into patent descriptions is particularly challenging due to their differing rhetorical styles and stringent legal requirements. Unlike black-box text-to-text approaches that struggle to model structural reasoning and legal constraints, we propose FlowPlan-G2P, a novel framework that mirrors the cognitive workflow of expert drafters by reformulating this task into three stages: (1) Concept Graph Induction, extracting technical entities and relationships into a directed graph via expert-like reasoning; (2) Paragraph and Section Planning, reorganizing the graph into coherent clusters aligned with canonical patent sections; and (3) Graph-Conditioned Generation, producing legally compliant paragraphs using section-specific subgraphs and tailored prompts. Experiments demonstrate that FlowPlan-G2P significantly improves logical coherence and legal compliance over end-to-end LLM baselines. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for paper-to-patent generation and advances structured text generation for specialized domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance biomedical NLP by addressing the need for precise, scalable, and interpretable knowledge bases in oncology.

Method: Develops a pipeline with MeSH concept identification, PubMed filtering, OpenIE triplet extraction, and NER enrichment.

Result: T5 models fine-tuned with the dataset show significantly better performance and semantic coherence.

Conclusion: OpenIE-derived resources offer scalable, low-cost solutions for improving biomedical NLP tasks.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into biomedical research offers new opportunities for domainspecific reasoning and knowledge representation. However, their performance depends heavily on the semantic quality of training data. In oncology, where precision and interpretability are vital, scalable methods for constructing structured knowledge bases are essential for effective fine-tuning. This study presents a pipeline for developing a lung cancer knowledge base using Open Information Extraction (OpenIE). The process includes: (1) identifying medical concepts with the MeSH thesaurus; (2) filtering open-access PubMed literature with permissive licenses (CC0); (3) extracting (subject, relation, object) triplets using OpenIE method; and (4) enriching triplet sets with Named Entity Recognition (NER) to ensure biomedical relevance. The resulting triplet sets provide a domain-specific, large-scale, and noise-aware resource for fine-tuning LLMs. We evaluated T5 models finetuned on this dataset through Supervised Semantic Fine-Tuning. Comparative assessments with ROUGE and BERTScore show significantly improved performance and semantic coherence, demonstrating the potential of OpenIE-derived resources as scalable, low-cost solutions for enhancing biomedical NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a redact-and-retry framework with constrained filtering to improve LLM-based document inconsistency detection, focusing on evidence extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited research on LLM-based approaches for document inconsistency detection, particularly in extracting evidence of inconsistencies.

Method: A redact-and-retry framework with constrained filtering is proposed, alongside new comprehensive evidence-extraction metrics.

Result: Experimental results show substantial improvement over direct prompting methods.

Conclusion: The introduced framework and metrics significantly enhance LLM-based inconsistency detection, with promising results supporting their effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful in many domains due to their impressive abilities that arise from large training datasets and large model sizes. However, research on LLM-based approaches to document inconsistency detection is relatively limited. There are two key aspects of document inconsistency detection: (i) classification of whether there exists any inconsistency, and (ii) providing evidence of the inconsistent sentences. We focus on the latter, and introduce new comprehensive evidence-extraction metrics and a redact-and-retry framework with constrained filtering that substantially improves LLM-based document inconsistency detection over direct prompting. We back our claims with promising experimental results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long contexts pose challenges for encoder-only language models in automated essay scoring, prompting exploration of ensemble methods to improve performance.

Method: Trained and evaluated BERT-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa) and ensemble models (embedding-based and supervised ML) on 17,307 essays (80%/10%/10% split), using Quadratic Weighted Kappa for performance.

Result: Ensemble-of-embeddings models significantly outperformed individual language models in scoring long essays.

Conclusion: Combining multiple pre-trained language model representations with gradient-boosting classifiers is highly effective for automated scoring of long essays.

Abstract: Long context may impose challenges for encoder-only language models in text processing, specifically for automated scoring of essays. This study trained several commonly used encoder-based language models for automated scoring of long essays. The performance of these trained models was evaluated and compared with the ensemble models built upon the base language models with a token limit of 512?. The experimented models include BERT-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa), ensemble models integrating embeddings from multiple encoder models, and ensemble models of feature-based supervised machine learning models, including Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. We trained, validated, and tested each model on a dataset of 17,307 essays, with an 80%/10%/10% split, and evaluated model performance using Quadratic Weighted Kappa. This study revealed that an ensemble-of-embeddings model that combines multiple pre-trained language model representations with gradient-boosting classifier as the ensemble model significantly outperforms individual language models at scoring long essays.

*Subha Ghoshal,Ali Al-Bustami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks inference-time planning and tool use in LLMs for Event-QA and CMV tasks, showing trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost, favoring task-specific choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how inference-time planning and external tools affect LLM performance in real-world tasks like question answering and persuasive response generation.

Method: Compared one-shot baselines with plan-execute-replan agents using tools like SPARQL and retrieval, testing GPT-4o variants on 120 examples total.

Result: Tool-augmented agents improved Event-QA accuracy but increased latency; CMV favored one-shot prompting. Smaller models degraded with complex tooling.

Conclusion: Task-specific, cost-aware decisions are crucial for balancing model size and tool complexity.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time planning and external tools to improve reasoning. We benchmark this behavior on two real-world settings: event-centric question answering over graph-structured knowledge (Event-QA) and persuasive response generation in Reddit ChangeMyView (CMV). Using LangChain and LangGraph, we compare a one-shot baseline against a plan--execute--replan agent equipped with task-specific tools (DBpedia SPARQL/lookup/schema exploration, Wikipedia-focused retrieval, and topical web search). We evaluate on 60 examples each from Event-QA and CMV (3 splits of 20), and report both mean end-to-end latency and per-example token cost estimates. We evaluate GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini under identical workflows and report accuracy and end-to-end latency. On Event-QA, the best tool-augmented configuration improves accuracy (e.g., 47.5\% $\rightarrow$ 67.5\% for GPT-4o) while increasing latency by orders of magnitude ($\sim$8s $\rightarrow$ $\sim$317s per example). On CMV, one-shot prompting is strongest (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves 75\% at $\sim$6s), and planning+search increases latency substantially without consistent gains. However, complex multi-tool orchestration exposes failure modes where the smaller model degrades. Overall, the findings highlight the need for task-specific, cost-aware choices of both model size and agent/tooling complexity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FactArena is a comprehensive, automated evaluation framework for LLMs in fact-checking, addressing claim extraction, evidence retrieval, and verdict prediction, revealing limitations overlooked by current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs in fact-checking focus narrowly on claim verification, missing broader workflow stages and systematic failures. FactArena aims to bridge this gap.

Method: FactArena integrates an LLM-driven fact-checking process, arena-styled judgment mechanism, and claim-evolution module to evaluate LLMs holistically across the fact-checking pipeline.

Result: FactArena provides stable rankings for 16 LLMs, uncovering discrepancies between claim-verification accuracy and end-to-end competence.

Conclusion: FactArena offers a scalable paradigm for diagnosing LLMs' factual reasoning, guiding future development and reliable deployment in fact-checking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world fact-checking systems, yet existing evaluations focus predominantly on claim verification and overlook the broader fact-checking workflow, including claim extraction and evidence retrieval. This narrow focus prevents current benchmarks from revealing systematic reasoning failures, factual blind spots, and robustness limitations of modern LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present FactArena, a fully automated arena-style evaluation framework that conducts comprehensive, stage-wise benchmarking of LLMs across the complete fact-checking pipeline. FactArena integrates three key components: (i) an LLM-driven fact-checking process that standardizes claim decomposition, evidence retrieval via tool-augmented interactions, and justification-based verdict prediction; (ii) an arena-styled judgment mechanism guided by consolidated reference guidelines to ensure unbiased and consistent pairwise comparisons across heterogeneous judge agents; and (iii) an arena-driven claim-evolution module that adaptively generates more challenging and semantically controlled claims to probe LLMs' factual robustness beyond fixed seed data. Across 16 state-of-the-art LLMs spanning seven model families, FactArena produces stable and interpretable rankings. Our analyses further reveal significant discrepancies between static claim-verification accuracy and end-to-end fact-checking competence, highlighting the necessity of holistic evaluation. The proposed framework offers a scalable and trustworthy paradigm for diagnosing LLMs' factual reasoning, guiding future model development, and advancing the reliable deployment of LLMs in safety-critical fact-checking applications.

### [79] [Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Aligned LLMs via Lexical Anchor Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02670)
*Devang Kulshreshtha,Hang Su,Chinmay Hegde,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LATS introduces a novel jailbreak method using lexical anchor injection, achieving high attack success rates with fewer queries compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak methods are resource-intensive and rely on attacker LLMs, making them expensive and non-interpretable.

Method: LATS reformulates jailbreaking as a breadth-first tree search over multi-turn dialogues, injecting lexical anchors incrementally.

Result: LATS achieves 97-100% ASR on GPT, Claude, and Llama models with only ~6.4 queries, outperforming other methods requiring 20+ queries.

Conclusion: LATS demonstrates conversational structure as a powerful attack surface and offers superior query efficiency.

Abstract: Most jailbreak methods achieve high attack success rates (ASR) but require attacker LLMs to craft adversarial queries and/or demand high query budgets. These resource limitations make jailbreaking expensive, and the queries generated by attacker LLMs often consist of non-interpretable random prefixes. This paper introduces Lexical Anchor Tree Search (), addressing these limitations through an attacker-LLM-free method that operates purely via lexical anchor injection. LATS reformulates jailbreaking as a breadth-first tree search over multi-turn dialogues, where each node incrementally injects missing content words from the attack goal into benign prompts. Evaluations on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that LATS achieves 97-100% ASR on latest GPT, Claude, and Llama models with an average of only ~6.4 queries, compared to 20+ queries required by other methods. These results highlight conversational structure as a potent and under-protected attack surface, while demonstrating superior query efficiency in an era where high ASR is readily achievable. Our code will be released to support reproducibility.

### [80] [Extracting books from production language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02671)
*Ahmed Ahmed,A. Feder Cooper,Sanmi Koyejo,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether copyrighted text can be extracted from production LLMs despite safeguards, using a two-phase extraction method, and finds varying success rates across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unresolved legal questions about LLMs memorizing copyrighted training data and assess whether extraction is feasible despite safety measures.

Method: A two-phase procedure: (1) initial probe with potential Best-of-N jailbreak, (2) iterative continuation prompts. Evaluated on Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 using nv-recall scores.

Result: Extraction feasibility varies: Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 didn't need jailbreaking (76.8%, 70.3% nv-recall), Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieved near-verbatim outputs (95.8%), and GPT-4.1 resisted more (4.0% after 20X attempts).

Conclusion: Production LLMs can still expose memorized copyrighted data, highlighting risks despite safeguards.

Abstract: Many unresolved legal questions over LLMs and copyright center on memorization: whether specific training data have been encoded in the model's weights during training, and whether those memorized data can be extracted in the model's outputs. While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%). Taken together, our work highlights that, even with model- and system-level safeguards, extraction of (in-copyright) training data remains a risk for production LLMs.

*Guangxin Wu,Hao Zhang,Zhang Zhibin,Jiafeng Guo,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured pruning framework for LLMs to reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance and hardware compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational and memory costs of large language models (LLMs) by moving beyond irregular sparsity patterns of existing pruning methods.

Method: Proposes a structured pruning framework using a hybrid multi-domain calibration set and iterative calibration to remove redundant model components.

Result: Achieves significant model compression with minimal performance loss across various tasks.

Conclusion: Structured pruning is an effective solution for deploying efficient LLMs without specialized hardware.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their ever-growing scale introduces significant barriers to real-world deployment, including substantial computational overhead, memory footprint, and inference latency. While model pruning presents a viable solution to these challenges, existing unstructured pruning techniques often yield irregular sparsity patterns that necessitate specialized hardware or software support. In this work, we explore structured pruning, which eliminates entire architectural components and maintains compatibility with standard hardware accelerators. We introduce a novel structured pruning framework that leverages a hybrid multi-domain calibration set and an iterative calibration strategy to effectively identify and remove redundant channels. Extensive experiments on various models across diverse downstream tasks show that our approach achieves significant compression with minimal performance degradation.

*Meysam Shirdel Bilehsavar,Negin Mahmoudi,Mohammad Jalili Torkamani,Kiana Kiashemshaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates three transformer-based models for multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection, incorporating explainability techniques like LIME for transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance online content moderation by improving the detection and mitigation of harmful or offensive material across multiple languages.

Method: Performance comparison of BERT-base-multilingual-cased, RoBERTa-base, and XLM-RoBERTa-base (with frozen layers) using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, supplemented with LIME for interpretability.

Result: Evaluation conducted across English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and French, with insights into model prediction behavior provided by LIME.

Conclusion: Combining transformer models with explainability techniques aims to boost effectiveness and transparency in multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis focuses on identifying the emotional polarity expressed in textual data, typically categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. Hate speech detection, on the other hand, aims to recognize content that incites violence, discrimination, or hostility toward individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. Both tasks play a critical role in online content moderation by enabling the detection and mitigation of harmful or offensive material, thereby contributing to safer digital environments. In this study, we examine the performance of three transformer-based models: BERT-base-multilingual-cased, RoBERTa-base, and XLM-RoBERTa-base with the first eight layers frozen, for multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection. The evaluation is conducted across five languages: English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and French. The models are compared using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To enhance model interpretability and provide deeper insight into prediction behavior, we integrate the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework, which highlights the contribution of individual words to the models decisions. By combining state-of-the-art transformer architectures with explainability techniques, this work aims to improve both the effectiveness and transparency of multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection systems.

*Agniv Roy Choudhury,Vignesh Ponselvan Rajasingh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines adversarial robustness in transformer QA systems, identifying key failure modes and optimal mitigation strategies. Scaling model size and contrastive learning improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in QA systems to adversarial examples and improve robustness through systematic experimentation and targeted strategies.

Method: Systematic experimentation on adversarial datasets, multi-level error analysis, adversarial fine-tuning, data augmentation, and implementation of mitigation strategies like Entity-Aware contrastive learning.

Result: Optimal adversarial fine-tuning ratio identified (80% clean + 20% adversarial). Entity-Aware contrastive learning achieved 89.89% AddSent EM and 90.73% SQuAD EM, nearly closing the adversarial gap.

Conclusion: Targeted mitigation, especially Entity-Aware contrastive learning and model scaling, can achieve near-parity between clean and adversarial performance in QA systems.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems achieve impressive performance on standard benchmarks like SQuAD, but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. This project investigates the adversarial robustness of transformer models on the AddSent adversarial dataset through systematic experimentation across model scales and targeted mitigation strategies. We perform comprehensive multi-level error analysis using five complementary categorization schemes, identifying negation confusion and entity substitution as the primary failure modes. Through systematic evaluation of adversarial fine-tuning ratios, we identify 80% clean + 20% adversarial data as optimal. Data augmentation experiments reveal a capacity bottleneck in small models. Scaling from ELECTRA-small (14M parameters) to ELECTRA-base (110M parameters) eliminates the robustness-accuracy trade-off, achieving substantial improvements on both clean and adversarial data. We implement three targeted mitigation strategies, with Entity-Aware contrastive learning achieving best performance: 89.89% AddSent Exact Match (EM) and 90.73% SQuAD EM, representing 94.9% closure of the adversarial gap. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating comprehensive linguistic error analysis with Named Entity Recognition (NER)-guided contrastive learning for adversarial QA, demonstrating that targeted mitigation can achieve near-parity between clean and adversarial performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reduce hallucinations in LLMs by integrating a code module into a knowledge distillation chain-style model, improving inference accuracy and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate prompt-induced hallucinations in LLMs by enhancing their ability to capture contextual information and provide structured external knowledge.

Method: Introduces a code module within a knowledge distillation chain-style model to guide knowledge-graph exploration and improve reasoning accuracy.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows significant improvements in HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 scores (up to 15.64%), with scores exceeding 95% in some settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces hallucinations and enhances the accuracy and verifiability of LLMs.

Abstract: To address hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes a method for mitigating prompt-induced hallucinations. Building on a knowledge distillation chain-style model, we introduce a code module to guide knowledge-graph exploration and incorporate code as part of the chain-of-thought prompt, forming an external knowledge input that provides more accurate and structured information to the model. Based on this design, we develop an improved knowledge distillation chain-style model and leverage it to analyze and constrain the reasoning process of LLMs, thereby improving inference accuracy. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3 on multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating code modules significantly enhances the model's ability to capture contextual information and effectively mitigates prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 improve by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method achieves HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These results indicate that the proposed approach substantially reduces hallucination behavior while improving the accuracy and verifiability of large language models.

*Luyao Chen,Weibo Gao,Junjie Wu,Jinshan Wu,Angela D. Friederici*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hierarchical language structures optimize processing efficiency within human working memory limits, explaining their universality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why human language is hierarchical, focusing on its alignment with working memory capacity.

Method: Used computational simulations and natural language validation with a likelihood function quantifying alignment with working memory.

Result: Hierarchical processing outperforms linear processing in staying within memory limits, aligning with developmental patterns.

Conclusion: Hierarchical structures optimize language processing efficiency under memory constraints, explaining their universal presence.

Abstract: Language is a uniquely human trait, conveying information efficiently by organizing word sequences in sentences into hierarchical structures. A central question persists: Why is human language hierarchical? In this study, we show that hierarchization optimally solves the challenge of our limited working memory capacity. We established a likelihood function that quantifies how well the average number of units according to the language processing mechanisms aligns with human working memory capacity (WMC) in a direct fashion. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of this function, tehta_MLE, turns out to be the mean of units. Through computational simulations of symbol sequences and validation analyses of natural language sentences, we uncover that compared to linear processing, hierarchical processing far surpasses it in constraining the tehta_MLE values under the human WMC limit, along with the increase of sequence/sentence length successfully. It also shows a converging pattern related to children's WMC development. These results suggest that constructing hierarchical structures optimizes the processing efficiency of sequential language input while staying within memory constraints, genuinely explaining the universal hierarchical nature of human language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synapse is a dynamic memory architecture for LLMs that outperforms standard retrieval methods by using graph-based activation and hybrid retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static retrieval-augmented approaches in handling long-term agentic memory for LLMs.

Method: Synapse uses a dynamic graph for memory, integrating lateral inhibition and temporal decay, with a Triple Hybrid Retrieval strategy combining embeddings and graph traversal.

Result: Synapse outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the LoCoMo benchmark in temporal and multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Synapse provides a robust solution to long-term memory challenges in LLMs, addressing the 'Contextual Tunneling' problem effectively.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generalized reasoning, standard retrieval-augmented approaches fail to address the disconnected nature of long-term agentic memory. To bridge this gap, we introduce Synapse (Synergistic Associative Processing Semantic Encoding), a unified memory architecture that transcends static vector similarity. Drawing from cognitive science, Synapse models memory as a dynamic graph where relevance emerges from spreading activation rather than pre-computed links. By integrating lateral inhibition and temporal decay, the system dynamically highlights relevant sub-graphs while filtering interference. We implement a Triple Hybrid Retrieval strategy that fuses geometric embeddings with activation-based graph traversal. Comprehensive evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark show that Synapse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in complex temporal and multi-hop reasoning tasks, offering a robust solution to the "Contextual Tunneling" problem. Our code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

*Yuetian Chen,Yuntao Du,Kaiyuan Zhang,Ashish Kundu,Charles Fleming,Bruno Ribeiro,Ninghui Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WBC, a window-based method for membership inference attacks (MIAs) on LLMs, outperforming global averaging approaches by focusing on localized signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MIAs rely on global signals like average loss, which dilute localized memorization signals, reducing effectiveness. The paper challenges this by focusing on pronounced membership signals in localized contexts.

Method: WBC uses a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. It slides windows of varying sizes across text, with each window voting on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. Votes are ensembled across window sizes to capture memorization patterns at different scales.

Result: WBC outperforms baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds across eleven datasets.

Conclusion: Aggregating localized evidence is more effective than global averaging, exposing privacy vulnerabilities in fine-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: Most membership inference attacks (MIAs) against Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on global signals, like average loss, to identify training data. This approach, however, dilutes the subtle, localized signals of memorization, reducing attack effectiveness. We challenge this global-averaging paradigm, positing that membership signals are more pronounced within localized contexts. We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. By ensembling votes across geometrically spaced window sizes, we capture memorization patterns from token-level artifacts to phrase-level structures. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate that WBC substantially outperforms established baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds. Our findings reveal that aggregating localized evidence is fundamentally more effective than global averaging, exposing critical privacy vulnerabilities in fine-tuned LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EComStage is a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based agents in e-commerce by assessing their reasoning across three stages: Perception, Planning, and Action, using seven diverse tasks. It includes both customer and merchant scenarios, offering detailed insights for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-based agents in e-commerce focus only on final task completion, missing the intermediate reasoning stages crucial for effective decision-making.

Method: EComStage evaluates 30+ LLMs across seven tasks, covering Perception, Planning, and Action stages, with human-annotated samples. It includes both customer and merchant-oriented scenarios.

Result: The benchmark reveals stage and orientation-specific strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, providing actionable insights for real-world applications.

Conclusion: EComStage fills a gap in evaluating LLM reasoning in e-commerce, offering a comprehensive tool for optimizing agent performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in e-commerce applications to assist customer services in tasks such as product inquiries, recommendations, and order management. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate whether these agents successfully complete the final task, overlooking the intermediate reasoning stages that are crucial for effective decision-making. To address this gap, we propose EComStage, a unified benchmark for evaluating agent-capable LLMs across the comprehensive stage-wise reasoning process: Perception (understanding user intent), Planning (formulating an action plan), and Action (executing the decision). EComStage evaluates LLMs through seven separate representative tasks spanning diverse e-commerce scenarios, with all samples human-annotated and quality-checked. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus only on customer-oriented interactions, EComStage also evaluates merchant-oriented scenarios, including promotion management, content review, and operational support relevant to real-world applications. We evaluate a wide range of over 30 LLMs, spanning from 1B to over 200B parameters, including open-source models and closed-source APIs, revealing stage/orientation- specific strengths and weaknesses. Our results provide fine-grained, actionable insights for designing and optimizing LLM-based agents in real-world e-commerce settings.

TL;DR: MiMo-V2-Flash is a 309B parameter Mixture-of-Experts model with 15B active parameters, featuring hybrid attention and efficient scaling via Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation. It rivals top models with fewer parameters and achieves fast inference via speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a high-performance model with efficient parameter usage and strong reasoning capabilities, surpassing existing open-weight models like DeepSeek-V3.2 and Kimi-K2.

Method: The model combines Sliding Window Attention and global attention, pre-trains on 27 trillion tokens with Multi-Token Prediction, and uses Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation for post-training scaling. Speculative decoding enhances inference speed.

Result: MiMo-V2-Flash competes with larger models using fewer parameters, achieving up to 3.6 acceptance length and 2.6x decoding speedup during inference.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates efficiency and performance, fostering open research through released weights.

Abstract: We present MiMo-V2-Flash, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 309B total parameters and 15B active parameters, designed for fast, strong reasoning and agentic capabilities. MiMo-V2-Flash adopts a hybrid attention architecture that interleaves Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with global attention, with a 128-token sliding window under a 5:1 hybrid ratio. The model is pre-trained on 27 trillion tokens with Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), employing a native 32k context length and subsequently extended to 256k. To efficiently scale post-training compute, MiMo-V2-Flash introduces a novel Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation (MOPD) paradigm. In this framework, domain-specialized teachers (e.g., trained via large-scale reinforcement learning) provide dense and token-level reward, enabling the student model to perfectly master teacher expertise. MiMo-V2-Flash rivals top-tier open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3.2 and Kimi-K2, despite using only 1/2 and 1/3 of their total parameters, respectively. During inference, by repurposing MTP as a draft model for speculative decoding, MiMo-V2-Flash achieves up to 3.6 acceptance length and 2.6x decoding speedup with three MTP layers. We open-source both the model weights and the three-layer MTP weights to foster open research and community collaboration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PHSA is a punctuation-aware hybrid sparse attention framework that improves semantic boundary preservation and reduces computational overhead in long-context modeling compared to dense and sparse attention methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse attention methods lose critical information due to coarse-grained semantic representations during block selection. PHSA addresses this by leveraging punctuation tokens as semantic boundary anchors.

Method: PHSA uses a dual-branch aggregation mechanism to fuse global semantic representations with punctuation-enhanced boundary features and introduces an extreme-sparsity-adaptive training strategy.

Result: PHSA outperforms dense attention and sparse baselines, reducing information loss by 10.8% at a 97.3% sparsity ratio in a 32k-token input scenario.

Conclusion: PHSA is a scalable and effective solution for long-context modeling, preserving semantic structure with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Attention serves as the fundamental mechanism for long-context modeling in large language models (LLMs), yet dense attention becomes structurally prohibitive for long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Consequently, sparse attention has received increasing attention as a scalable alternative. However, existing sparse attention methods rely on coarse-grained semantic representations during block selection, which blur intra-block semantic boundaries and lead to the loss of critical information. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{P}unctuation-aware \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{S}parse \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{(PHSA)}, a natively trainable sparse attention framework that leverages punctuation tokens as semantic boundary anchors. Specifically, (1) we design a dual-branch aggregation mechanism that fuses global semantic representations with punctuation-enhanced boundary features, preserving the core semantic structure while introducing almost no additional computational overhead; (2) we introduce an extreme-sparsity-adaptive training and inference strategy that stabilizes model behavior under very low token activation ratios; Extensive experiments on general benchmarks and long-context evaluations demonstrate that PHSA consistently outperforms dense attention and state-of-the-art sparse attention baselines, including InfLLM v2. Specifically, for the 0.6B-parameter model with 32k-token input sequences, PHSA can reduce the information loss by 10.8\% at a sparsity ratio of 97.3\%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free, label-free method for short text clustering using iterative vector updating and LLM guidance, achieving competitive results without needing labeled data or cluster numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Companies face challenges clustering user utterances from chatbots without labeled data or known cluster counts, necessitating a flexible, scalable solution.

Method: The method uses iterative vector updating and LLM guidance to refine sparse vectors derived from representative texts, requiring no labels or prior cluster knowledge.

Result: Experiments show the method performs comparably or better than contrastive learning-based approaches, works with various embedders and LLMs, and scales efficiently.

Conclusion: The method's adaptability, scalability, and low-resource needs make it suitable for real-world applications lacking labeled data.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training-free and label-free method for short text clustering that can be used on top of any existing embedder. In the context of customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In these commercial settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the number of clusters is not known. Our method is based on iterative vector updating: it constructs sparse vectors based on representative texts, and then iteratively refines them through LLM guidance. Our method achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods that use contrastive learning, but without assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different clustering methods. We also show that our method scales to large datasets, reducing the computational cost of the LLM. These low-resource, adaptable settings and the scalability of our method make it more aligned with real-world scenarios than existing clustering methods.

### [92] [The performances of the Chinese and U.S. Large Language Models on the Topic of Chinese Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02830)
*Feiyan Liu,Chenxun Zhuo,Siyan Zhao,Bao Ge,Tianming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines cultural differences in large language models (LLMs) from China and the U.S. by evaluating their performance on Chinese cultural questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs exhibit cultural biases based on their country of origin.

Method: A direct-questioning paradigm is used to evaluate models like GPT-5.1, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-Max, and Gemini2.5Pro on Chinese cultural topics.

Result: Chinese models outperform U.S. models on Chinese cultural tasks, with Gemini 2.5Pro and GPT-5.1 being top performers among U.S. models.

Conclusion: Performance differences may stem from training data, localization strategies, and focus on Chinese cultural content during development.

Abstract: Cultural backgrounds shape individuals' perspectives and approaches to problem-solving. Since the emergence of GPT-1 in 2018, large language models (LLMs) have undergone rapid development. To date, the world's ten leading LLM developers are primarily based in China and the United States. To examine whether LLMs released by Chinese and U.S. developers exhibit cultural differences in Chinese-language settings, we evaluate their performance on questions about Chinese culture. This study adopts a direct-questioning paradigm to evaluate models such as GPT-5.1, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-Max, and Gemini2.5Pro. We assess their understanding of traditional Chinese culture, including history, literature, poetry, and related domains. Comparative analyses between LLMs developed in China and the U.S. indicate that Chinese models generally outperform their U.S. counterparts on these tasks. Among U.S.-developed models, Gemini 2.5Pro and GPT-5.1 achieve relatively higher accuracy. The observed performance differences may potentially arise from variations in training data distribution, localization strategies, and the degree of emphasis on Chinese cultural content during model development.

*Kai Li,Xuanqing Yu,Ziyi Ni,Yi Zeng,Yao Xu,Zheqing Zhang,Xin Li,Jitao Sang,Xiaogang Duan,Xuelei Wang,Chengbao Liu,Jie Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TiMem is a temporal-hierarchical memory framework for conversational agents that organizes conversations using a Temporal Memory Tree, improving memory consolidation and recall efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory frameworks struggle with temporally structured information and fragmented memories, hindering long-horizon personalization in conversational agents.

Method: TiMem introduces a Temporal Memory Tree (TMT) with semantic-guided consolidation and complexity-aware recall to organize and retrieve memories efficiently.

Result: TiMem achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (75.30% on LoCoMo, 76.88% on LongMemEval-S) and reduces recalled memory length by 52.20% on LoCoMo.

Conclusion: TiMem effectively addresses temporal continuity in long-horizon memory for conversational agents, outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Long-horizon conversational agents have to manage ever-growing interaction histories that quickly exceed the finite context windows of large language models (LLMs). Existing memory frameworks provide limited support for temporally structured information across hierarchical levels, often leading to fragmented memories and unstable long-horizon personalization. We present TiMem, a temporal--hierarchical memory framework that organizes conversations through a Temporal Memory Tree (TMT), enabling systematic memory consolidation from raw conversational observations to progressively abstracted persona representations. TiMem is characterized by three core properties: (1) temporal--hierarchical organization through TMT; (2) semantic-guided consolidation that enables memory integration across hierarchical levels without fine-tuning; and (3) complexity-aware memory recall that balances precision and efficiency across queries of varying complexity. Under a consistent evaluation setup, TiMem achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both benchmarks, reaching 75.30% on LoCoMo and 76.88% on LongMemEval-S. It outperforms all evaluated baselines while reducing the recalled memory length by 52.20% on LoCoMo. Manifold analysis indicates clear persona separation on LoCoMo and reduced dispersion on LongMemEval-S. Overall, TiMem treats temporal continuity as a first-class organizing principle for long-horizon memory in conversational agents.

*Saurabh Kumar Pandey,Sougata Saha,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ISDP evaluates LLMs by predicting demographics from user behavior, showing better performance with actual behaviors but diminishing returns at individual levels, revealing personalization limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address confounding factors in SDP (stereotyping, bias) by evaluating LLMs' cultural competency through ISDP.

Method: Use ISDP to prompt LLMs to predict demographics from real and simulated user behavior in the Goodreads-CSI dataset, testing four models.

Result: Models perform better with actual behaviors but show similar, poorer performance at individual levels.

Conclusion: ISDP reveals limits in personalization and challenges assumptions about bias detection.

Abstract: Socio-demographic prompting (SDP) - prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) using demographic proxies to generate culturally aligned outputs - often shows LLM responses as stereotypical and biased. While effective in assessing LLMs' cultural competency, SDP is prone to confounding factors such as prompt sensitivity, decoding parameters, and the inherent difficulty of generation over discrimination tasks due to larger output spaces. These factors complicate interpretation, making it difficult to determine if the poor performance is due to bias or the task design. To address this, we use inverse socio-demographic prompting (ISDP), where we prompt LLMs to discriminate and predict the demographic proxy from actual and simulated user behavior from different users. We use the Goodreads-CSI dataset (Saha et al., 2025), which captures difficulty in understanding English book reviews for users from India, Mexico, and the USA, and test four LLMs: Aya-23, Gemma-2, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3.1 with ISDP. Results show that models perform better with actual behaviors than simulated ones, contrary to what SDP suggests. However, performance with both behavior types diminishes and becomes nearly equal at the individual level, indicating limits to personalization.

*Adrian Cosma,Stefan Ruseti,Emilian Radoi,Mihai Dascalu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces homotokens as meaning-preserving alternative subword segmentations, proposing a lightweight training architecture to improve model generalization and delay overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the non-uniqueness of subword tokenization in language models, where different token sequences can decode to the same surface form, yet internal computations vary.

Method: A lightweight training architecture is introduced, conditioning canonical next-token prediction on sampled homotoken variants via an auxiliary causal encoder and block-causal cross-attention.

Result: Homotoken augmentation delays overfitting and improves generalization in data-constrained pretraining, with effectiveness in multilingual fine-tuning depending on tokenizer quality.

Conclusion: Homotokens offer a simple, modular mechanism to induce tokenization invariance in language models, with benefits tied to tokenizer characteristics.

Abstract: Subword tokenization introduces a computational layer in language models where many distinct token sequences decode to the same surface form and preserve meaning, yet induce different internal computations. Despite this non-uniqueness, language models are typically trained using a single canonical longest-prefix tokenization. We formalize homotokens-alternative valid subword segmentations of the same lexical item-as a strictly meaning-preserving form of data augmentation. We introduce a lightweight training architecture that conditions canonical next-token prediction on sampled homotoken variants via an auxiliary causal encoder and block-causal cross-attention, without modifying the training objective or token interface. In data-constrained pretraining, homotoken augmentation consistently delays overfitting under repeated data exposure and improves generalization across diverse evaluation datasets. In multilingual fine-tuning, we find that the effectiveness of homotokens depends on tokenizer quality: gains are strongest when canonical tokens are highly compressed and diminish when the tokenizer already over-fragments the input. Overall, homotokens provide a simple and modular mechanism for inducing tokenization invariance in language models.

### [96] [LongBench Pro: A More Realistic and Comprehensive Bilingual Long-Context Evaluation Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02872)
*Ziyang Chen,Xing Wu,Junlong Jia,Chaochen Gao,Qi Fu,Debing Zhang,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongBench Pro is a bilingual benchmark for evaluating long-context LLMs with 1,500 samples spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, supporting fine-grained analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack scalability and realism for evaluating long-context LLMs, necessitating a more comprehensive and realistic benchmark.

Method: Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: LLMs draft questions and answers, experts verify and refine.

Result: Found 1) long-context optimization > parameter scaling, 2) effective context < claimed, 3) 'thinking' paradigm helps reasoning-trained models.

Conclusion: LongBench Pro is a robust testbed for advancing long-context understanding.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of context length in large language models (LLMs) has outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks. Current long-context benchmarks often trade off scalability and realism: synthetic tasks underrepresent real-world complexity, while fully manual annotation is costly to scale to extreme lengths and diverse scenarios. We present LongBench Pro, a more realistic and comprehensive bilingual benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens. LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance). To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification. Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases. Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the "thinking" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off. In summary, LongBench Pro provides a robust testbed for advancing long-context understanding.

TL;DR: The paper explores LLM's for data compression, achieving a new SOTA adjusted rate of ~18% on enwik9 without training, and tests non-English/code compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address practical challenges in replacing traditional compression with LLMs and improve compression rates.

Method: Investigated methods using LLMs as compressors, focusing on adjusted rates without retraining.

Result: Achieved ~18% adjusted compression rate on enwik9; competitive performance on non-natural text sequences.

Conclusion: LLMs excel in text-dominant domains and remain competitive for non-natural sequences with proper configuration.

Abstract: In this report, we investigate the potential use of large language models (LLM's) in the task of data compression. Previous works have demonstrated promising results in applying LLM's towards compressing not only text, but also a wide range of multi-modal data. Despite the favorable performance achieved, there still remains several practical questions that pose a challenge towards replacing existing data compression algorithms with LLM's. In this work, we explore different methods to achieve a lower adjusted compression rate using LLM's as data compressors. In comparison to previous works, we were able to achieve a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) adjusted compression rate of around $18\%$ on the enwik9 dataset without additional model training. Furthermore, we explore the use of LLM's in compressing non-English data, code data, byte stream sequences. We show that while LLM's excel in compressing data in text-dominant domains, their ability in compressing non-natural text sequences still remain competitive if configured in the right way.

*Bach Phan-Tat,Kris Heylen,Dirk Geeraerts,Stefano De Pascale,Dirk Speelman*

TL;DR: A method using dependency co-occurrence patterns outperforms neural network-based approaches for lexical semantic change detection, offering interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opacity of neural network-based approaches in lexical semantic change detection (LSC).

Method: Relies on dependency co-occurrence patterns of words.

Result: Effective for semantic change detection and outperforms several distributional semantic models.

Conclusion: The method provides plausible and interpretable predictions.

Abstract: Most modern computational approaches to lexical semantic change detection (LSC) rely on embedding-based distributional word representations with neural networks. Despite the strong performance on LSC benchmarks, they are often opaque. We investigate an alternative method which relies purely on dependency co-occurrence patterns of words. We demonstrate that it is effective for semantic change detection and even outperforms a number of distributional semantic models. We provide an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the predictions, showing that they are plausible and interpretable.

TL;DR: The paper addresses script variability in multilingual speech models like Whisper by showing script is linearly encoded in activation space, enabling post-hoc control over output script.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regional varieties of languages use different scripts, causing non-determinism in speech recognition output.

Method: Demonstrates script is linearly encoded in model activations and modifies them at inference to control output script.

Result: Adds script vectors to induce script changes, even unconventional pairings, maintaining competitive performance in Whisper.

Conclusion: Post-hoc script control is feasible and effective for multilingual speech models.

Abstract: Multilingual speech foundation models such as Whisper are trained on web-scale data, where data for each language consists of a myriad of regional varieties. However, different regional varieties often employ different scripts to write the same language, rendering speech recognition output also subject to non-determinism in the output script. To mitigate this problem, we show that script is linearly encoded in the activation space of multilingual speech models, and that modifying activations at inference time enables direct control over output script. We find the addition of such script vectors to activations at test time can induce script change even in unconventional language-script pairings (e.g. Italian in Cyrillic and Japanese in Latin script). We apply this approach to inducing post-hoc control over the script of speech recognition output, where we observe competitive performance across all model sizes of Whisper.

TL;DR: This survey organizes LLM research into six lifecycle stages, reviews foundational theories, and identifies frontier challenges to advance LLMs from engineering to science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the theoretical fragmentation and lack of understanding of LLMs, treating them as 'black boxes'.

Method: Proposes a unified lifecycle-based taxonomy (six stages) and systematically reviews foundational theories and mechanisms.

Result: Identifies core theoretical issues and frontier challenges, providing a roadmap for principled LLM development.

Conclusion: Connects empirical practices with scientific inquiry, aiming to transition LLM development into a rigorous discipline.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has precipitated a profound paradigm shift in Artificial Intelligence, delivering monumental engineering successes that increasingly impact modern society. However, a critical paradox persists within the current field: despite the empirical efficacy, our theoretical understanding of LLMs remains disproportionately nascent, forcing these systems to be treated largely as ``black boxes''. To address this theoretical fragmentation, this survey proposes a unified lifecycle-based taxonomy that organizes the research landscape into six distinct stages: Data Preparation, Model Preparation, Training, Alignment, Inference, and Evaluation. Within this framework, we provide a systematic review of the foundational theories and internal mechanisms driving LLM performance. Specifically, we analyze core theoretical issues such as the mathematical justification for data mixtures, the representational limits of various architectures, and the optimization dynamics of alignment algorithms. Moving beyond current best practices, we identify critical frontier challenges, including the theoretical limits of synthetic data self-improvement, the mathematical bounds of safety guarantees, and the mechanistic origins of emergent intelligence. By connecting empirical observations with rigorous scientific inquiry, this work provides a structured roadmap for transitioning LLM development from engineering heuristics toward a principled scientific discipline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAL2M is a retrieval-augmented framework that reduces LLM hallucinations by using LLMs as matching judges, combined with a query-adaptive ensemble strategy for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in LLMs poses a compliance risk, requiring explicit knowledge grounding for reliable responses.

Method: RAL2M repositions LLMs as judges in a retrieval-based system and employs a query-adaptive latent ensemble to model heterogeneous model competence.

Result: The framework outperforms baselines by leveraging collective model wisdom and reducing hallucination.

Conclusion: RAL2M offers a robust alternative to generative approaches and highlights potential for future work with latent representations.

Abstract: Hallucination is a major concern in LLM-driven service systems, necessitating explicit knowledge grounding for compliance-guaranteed responses. In this paper, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Learning-to-Match (RAL2M), a novel framework that eliminates generation hallucination by repositioning LLMs as query-response matching judges within a retrieval-based system, providing a robust alternative to purely generative approaches. To further mitigate judgment hallucination, we propose a query-adaptive latent ensemble strategy that explicitly models heterogeneous model competence and interdependencies among LLMs, deriving a calibrated consensus decision. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively leverages the "wisdom of the crowd" and significantly outperforms strong baselines. Finally, we discuss best practices and promising directions for further exploiting latent representations in future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Autoregressive LLMs show relational task proficiency but unclear semantic learning. A synthetic framework reveals relational semantics emerge with logic supervision, and reversal failures stem from order bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify if autoregressive LLMs learn relational logic semantics and identify causes of reversal failures.

Method: Employed a Knowledge Graph-based synthetic framework with symmetric/inverse triples, trained GPT-style models, and tested memorization, inference, and generalization.

Result: Relational semantics emerge with logic supervision; reversal failures are due to autoregressive order bias.

Conclusion: Order bias causes reversal failures; relational semantics are learnable with adequate supervision.

Abstract: Autoregressive LLMs perform well on relational tasks that require linking entities via relational words (e.g., father/son, friend), but it is unclear whether they learn the logical semantics of such relations (e.g., symmetry and inversion logic) and, if so, whether reversal-type failures arise from missing relational semantics or left-to-right order bias. We propose a controlled Knowledge Graph-based synthetic framework that generates text from symmetric/inverse triples, train GPT-style autoregressive models from scratch, and evaluate memorization, logical inference, and in-context generalization to unseen entities to address these questions. We find a sharp phase transition in which relational semantics emerge with sufficient logic-bearing supervision, even in shallow (2-3 layer) models, and that successful generalization aligns with stable intermediate-layer signals. Finally, order-matched forward/reverse tests and a diffusion baseline indicate that reversal failures are primarily driven by autoregressive order bias rather than deficient inversion semantics.

TL;DR: Pearmut is a lightweight platform simplifying human evaluation in multilingual NLP, making it as easy as automatic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluation is crucial but often skipped due to complexity and overhead; Pearmut aims to eliminate these barriers.

Method: Pearmut supports multilingual tasks, especially machine translation, with standard protocols (DA, ESA, MQM) and extensibility for new ones. It includes features like document-level context, contrastive evaluation, and active learning-based assignments.

Result: Pearmut makes reliable human evaluation practical for routine model development and diagnosis.

Conclusion: Pearmut transforms human evaluation into an accessible, regular practice in NLP workflows.

Abstract: Human evaluation is the gold standard for multilingual NLP, but is often skipped in practice and substituted with automatic metrics, because it is notoriously complex and slow to set up with existing tools with substantial engineering and operational overhead. We introduce Pearmut, a lightweight yet feature-rich platform that makes end-to-end human evaluation as easy to run as automatic evaluation. Pearmut removes common entry barriers and provides support for evaluating multilingual tasks, with a particular focus on machine translation. The platform implements standard evaluation protocols, including DA, ESA, or MQM, but is also extensible to allow prototyping new protocols. It features document-level context, absolute and contrastive evaluation, attention checks, ESAAI pre-annotations and both static and active learning-based assignment strategies. Pearmut enables reliable human evaluation to become a practical, routine component of model development and diagnosis rather than an occasional effort.

*Jeonghyun Park,Byeongjeong Kim,Seojin Hwang,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses biases in multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems, revealing that perceived English preference stems from structural biases in evaluation benchmarks. It introduces DeLP to measure language preference accurately and DELTA, a framework leveraging monolingual alignment for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the true language preferences in mRAG systems, as prior studies conflate structural biases (e.g., exposure bias, gold availability, cultural priors) with model bias, leading to inaccurate conclusions.

Method: The authors propose DeLP, a debiased metric to isolate structural biases, and DELTA, a lightweight mRAG framework optimizing cross-lingual retrieval and generation using monolingual alignment.

Result: DeLP shows English preference is due to evidence distribution, not model bias. DELTA outperforms English pivoting and mRAG baselines across languages.

Conclusion: Structural biases distort language preference measurement. Monolingual alignment is key for mRAG performance, validated by DELTA's success.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems often exhibit a perceived preference for high-resource languages, particularly English, resulting in the widespread adoption of English pivoting. While prior studies attribute this advantage to the superior English-centric capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we find that such measurements are significantly distorted by structural priors inherent in evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we identify exposure bias and a gold availability prior-both driven by the disproportionate concentration of resources in English-as well as cultural priors rooted in topic locality, as factors that hinder accurate assessment of genuine language preference. To address these biases, we propose DeLP (Debiased Language Preference), a calibrated metric designed to explicitly factor out these structural confounds. Our analysis using DeLP reveals that the previously reported English preference is largely a byproduct of evidence distribution rather than an inherent model bias. Instead, we find that retrievers fundamentally favor monolingual alignment between the query and the document language. Building on this insight, we introduce DELTA (DEbiased Language preference-guided Text Augmentation), a lightweight and efficient mRAG framework that strategically leverages monolingual alignment to optimize cross-lingual retrieval and generation. Experimental results demonstrate that DELTA consistently outperforms English pivoting and mRAG baselines across diverse languages.

TL;DR: A novel framework combines ensemble changepoint detection methods with LLMs for improved accuracy and interpretability in time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations in method selection and lack of contextual explanations for detected changes.

Method: Aggregates results from ten detection algorithms and uses an LLM-powered pipeline for explanations.

Result: Superior performance and robustness compared to individual methods, with actionable insights.

Conclusion: The framework is practical across diverse domains, enhancing decision-making.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel changepoint detection framework that combines ensemble statistical methods with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance both detection accuracy and the interpretability of regime changes in time series data. Two critical limitations in the field are addressed. First, individual detection methods exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses depending on data characteristics, making method selection non-trivial and prone to suboptimal results. Second, automated, contextual explanations for detected changes are largely absent. The proposed ensemble method aggregates results from ten distinct changepoint detection algorithms, achieving superior performance and robustness compared to individual methods. Additionally, an LLM-powered explanation pipeline automatically generates contextual narratives, linking detected changepoints to potential real-world historical events. For private or domain-specific data, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution enables explanations grounded in user-provided documents. The open source Python framework demonstrates practical utility in diverse domains, including finance, political science, and environmental science, transforming raw statistical output into actionable insights for analysts and decision-makers.

TL;DR: The study focuses on improving OCR accuracy for Bahnar language digitization using advanced detection techniques and probabilistic post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bahnar language preservation is challenged by limited research and poor-quality digitized documents, necessitating better OCR methods.

Method: Combines table/non-table detection algorithms with probability-based post-processing heuristics to correct OCR errors.

Result: Achieved a notable accuracy improvement from 72.86% to 79.26% in OCR recognition.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework for Bahnar and other minority language digitization, aiding preservation efforts.

Abstract: Bahnar, a minority language spoken across Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, faces significant preservation challenges due to limited research and data availability. This study addresses the critical need for accurate digitization of Bahnar language documents through optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Digitizing scanned paper documents poses significant challenges, as degraded image quality from broken or blurred areas introduces considerable OCR errors that compromise information retrieval systems. We propose a comprehensive approach combining advanced table and non-table detection techniques with probability-based post-processing heuristics to enhance recognition accuracy. Our method first applies detection algorithms to improve input data quality, then employs probabilistic error correction on OCR output. Experimental results indicate a substantial improvement, with recognition accuracy increasing from 72.86% to 79.26%. This work contributes valuable resources for Bahnar language preservation and provides a framework applicable to other minority language digitization efforts.

TL;DR: A multi-stage efficient reasoning method is proposed for LLMs, reducing response length by 28-40% with minimal accuracy drops, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of 'overthinking' in chain-of-thought reasoning, where excessive intermediate tokens increase computation cost without improving accuracy.

Method: Combines supervised fine-tuning (via rejection sampling or reasoning trace reformatting) with reinforcement learning using an adaptive length penalty and a lightweight reward function.

Result: Reduces response length by 28% for 8B models and 40% for 32B models with minor accuracy drops (1.6 and 2.5 points). Achieves superior trade-off with a 76.6 score on the Overthinking-Adjusted Accuracy curve.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances accuracy and response length, outperforming complex state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved substantially through increased test-time computation, typically in the form of intermediate tokens known as chain-of-thought (CoT). However, CoT often becomes unnecessarily long, increasing computation cost without actual accuracy gains or sometimes even degrading performance, a phenomenon known as ``overthinking''. We propose a multi-stage efficient reasoning method that combines supervised fine-tuning -- via rejection sampling or reasoning trace reformatting -- with reinforcement learning using an adaptive length penalty. We introduce a lightweight reward function that penalizes tokens generated after the first correct answer but encouraging self-verification only when beneficial. We conduct a holistic evaluation across seven diverse reasoning tasks, analyzing the accuracy--response length trade-off. Our approach reduces response length by an average of 28\% for 8B models and 40\% for 32B models, while incurring only minor performance drops of 1.6 and 2.5 points, respectively. Despite its conceptual simplicity, it achieves a superior trade-off compared to more complex state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods, scoring 76.6, in terms of the area under the Overthinking-Adjusted Accuracy curve ($\text{AUC}_{\text{OAA}}$) -- 5 points above the base model and 2.5 points above the second-best approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of linking internal features in LLMs to reliable control of complex semantic behaviors during language generation.

Method: Uses a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline with controlled semantic oppositions, combining activation analysis and generation-based validation to extract monosemantic features.

Result: Achieves precise bidirectional steering of model behavior, maintaining stability and performance better than existing methods like CAA. Identifies Functional Faithfulness, showing coherent shifts across linguistic dimensions.

Conclusion: LLMs internalize high-order concepts deeply, and the presented method offers a robust approach for regulating complex AI behaviors.

Abstract: Recent work in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) has enabled the identification and intervention of internal features in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a persistent challenge lies in linking such internal features to the reliable control of complex, behavior-level semantic attributes in language generation. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Autoencoder-based framework for retrieving and steering semantically interpretable internal features associated with high-level linguistic behaviors. Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces. Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs internalize deeply integrated representations of high-order concepts, and provide a novel, robust mechanistic path for the regulation of complex AI behaviors.

### [109] [P-Check: Advancing Personalized Reward Model via Learning to Generate Dynamic Checklist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02986)
*Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-Check is a personalized reward modeling framework that dynamically generates evaluation criteria to better align with individual preferences, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat user context as static or implicit, missing the dynamic and nuanced nature of human judgment. P-Check addresses this gap.

Method: P-Check uses a plug-and-play checklist generator and Preference-Contrastive Criterion Weighting to dynamically highlight discriminative criteria for personalized judgment.

Result: P-Check improves reward accuracy, enhances personalized generation, and performs robustly in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.

Conclusion: P-Check effectively captures dynamic user preferences, offering a scalable and robust solution for personalized reward modeling.

Abstract: Recent approaches in personalized reward modeling have primarily focused on leveraging user interaction history to align model judgments with individual preferences. However, existing approaches largely treat user context as a static or implicit conditioning signal, failing to capture the dynamic and multi-faceted nature of human judgment. In this paper, we propose P-Check, a novel personalized reward modeling framework, designed to train a plug-and-play checklist generator that synthesizes dynamic evaluation criteria for guiding the reward prediction. To better align these checklists with personalized nuances, we introduce Preference-Contrastive Criterion Weighting, a training strategy that assigns saliency scores to criteria based on their discriminative power for personalized judgment. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that P-Check not only improves reward accuracy but also enhances downstream personalized generation, and remains robust in OOD scenarios.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with large counting tasks due to transformer architecture limits. A System-2-inspired strategy breaks tasks into smaller sub-problems, improving accuracy and offering mechanistic insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face systematic limitations in counting tasks due to architectural constraints, prompting the need for a solution to enhance their counting accuracy.

Method: The proposed strategy decomposes large counting tasks into smaller sub-problems, leveraging latent counts stored in item representations, transferred via attention heads, and aggregated for the final count.

Result: Experimental results show the strategy enables LLMs to overcome architectural limits and achieve high accuracy on large-scale counting tasks.

Conclusion: This work provides mechanistic insights into System-2 counting in LLMs and offers a generalizable approach to improve their reasoning behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite strong performance on complex mathematical problems, exhibit systematic limitations in counting tasks. This issue arises from architectural limits of transformers, where counting is performed across layers, leading to degraded precision for larger counting problems due to depth constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a simple test-time strategy inspired by System-2 cognitive processes that decomposes large counting tasks into smaller, independent sub-problems that the model can reliably solve. We evaluate this approach using observational and causal mediation analyses to understand the underlying mechanism of this System-2-like strategy. Our mechanistic analysis identifies key components: latent counts are computed and stored in the final item representations of each part, transferred to intermediate steps via dedicated attention heads, and aggregated in the final stage to produce the total count. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy enables LLMs to surpass architectural limitations and achieve high accuracy on large-scale counting tasks. This work provides mechanistic insight into System-2 counting in LLMs and presents a generalizable approach for improving and understanding their reasoning behavior.

*Qianchi Zhang,Hainan Zhang,Liang Pang,Hongwei Zheng,Zhiming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of document order in RAG on LLM outputs, revealing sensitivity to permutations even with the gold document fixed. It proposes Stable-RAG, which estimates and mitigates this sensitivity to improve consistency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored sensitivity of LLMs to the order of retrieved documents in RAG systems, which affects answer consistency and accuracy.

Method: Stable-RAG runs the generator under multiple retrieval orders, clusters hidden states to identify dominant reasoning patterns, and aligns outputs to correct answers.

Result: Experiments show Stable-RAG improves accuracy, consistency, and robustness across datasets, retrievers, and input lengths compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Stable-RAG effectively mitigates permutation-induced hallucinations, enhancing the reliability and performance of RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for reducing factual hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), yet little is known about how the order of retrieved documents affects model behavior. We empirically show that under Top-5 retrieval with the gold document included, LLM answers vary substantially across permutations of the retrieved set, even when the gold document is fixed in the first position. This reveals a previously underexplored sensitivity to retrieval permutations. Although robust RAG methods primarily focus on enhancing LLM robustness to low-quality retrieval and mitigating positional bias to distribute attention fairly over long contexts, neither approach directly addresses permutation sensitivity. In this paper, we propose Stable-RAG, which exploits permutation sensitivity estimation to mitigate permutation-induced hallucinations. Stable-RAG runs the generator under multiple retrieval orders, clusters hidden states, and decodes from a cluster-center representation that captures the dominant reasoning pattern. It then uses these reasoning results to align hallucinated outputs toward the correct answer, encouraging the model to produce consistent and accurate predictions across document permutations. Experiments on three QA datasets show that Stable-RAG significantly improves answer accuracy, reasoning consistency and robust generalization across datasets, retrievers, and input lengths compared with baselines.

*Yihong Liu,Raoyuan Zhao,Hinrich Schütze,Michael A. Hedderich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates multilingual latent reasoning in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) across 11 languages, revealing its uneven presence and alignment with English-centric pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the presence and behavior of latent reasoning in multilingual contexts, as previous work focused primarily on English.

Method: A truncation-based strategy is used to measure stepwise latent prediction formation by analyzing partial reasoning traces.

Result: Evidence of multilingual latent reasoning is found, stronger in resource-rich languages and weaker in low-resource ones, with an English-centered pattern.

Conclusion: Latent reasoning in LRMs is consistent across languages but shows an English-centric pathway, highlighting disparities in multilingual performance.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, often attributed to their capability to generate explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. However, recent work shows that LRMs often arrive at the correct answer before completing these textual reasoning steps, indicating the presence of latent reasoning -- internal, non-verbal computation encoded in hidden states. While this phenomenon has been explored in English, its multilingual behavior remains largely unknown. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of multilingual latent reasoning in LRMs across 11 languages. Using a truncation-based strategy, we examine how the correct answer emerges as the model is given only partial reasoning traces, allowing us to measure stepwise latent prediction formation. Our results reveal clear evidence of multilingual latent reasoning, though unevenly: strong in resource-rich languages, weaker in low-resource ones, and broadly less observable on harder benchmarks. To understand whether these differences reflect distinct internal mechanisms, we further perform representational analyses. Despite surface-level disparities, we find that the internal evolution of predictions is highly consistent across languages and broadly aligns with English -- a pattern suggesting an English-centered latent reasoning pathway.

*Junli Liang,Pengfei Zhou,Wangqiu Zhou,Wenjie Qing,Qi Zhao,Ziwen Wang,Qi Song,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SentGraph introduces a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework for multi-hop QA, outperforming traditional chunk-based retrieval by modeling fine-grained logical relationships between sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG struggles with multi-hop QA due to irrelevant and incoherent context retrieval, requiring a finer-grained approach.

Method: Constructs a hierarchical sentence graph using Rhetorical Structure Theory, organizes sentences into topic-level subgraphs, and performs graph-guided retrieval.

Result: SentGraph shows superior performance on four multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of sentence-level logical dependencies is crucial for effective multi-hop reasoning.

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively supports single-hop question answering with large language models but faces significant limitations in multi-hop question answering tasks, which require combining evidence from multiple documents. Existing chunk-based retrieval often provides irrelevant and logically incoherent context, leading to incomplete evidence chains and incorrect reasoning during answer generation. To address these challenges, we propose SentGraph, a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework that explicitly models fine-grained logical relationships between sentences for multi-hop question answering. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical sentence graph offline by first adapting Rhetorical Structure Theory to distinguish nucleus and satellite sentences, and then organizing them into topic-level subgraphs with cross-document entity bridges. During online retrieval, SentGraph performs graph-guided evidence selection and path expansion to retrieve fine-grained sentence-level evidence. Extensive experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SentGraph, validating the importance of explicitly modeling sentence-level logical dependencies for multi-hop reasoning.

TL;DR: MMFormalizer introduces multimodal autoformalization, integrating adaptive grounding to translate visual and textual math/physics into formal statements, evaluated on PhyX-AF benchmark with strong performance from GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing autoformalization’s challenge in multimodal contexts, especially physics, where hidden constraints must be inferred from visual elements.

Method: MMFormalizer uses recursive grounding and axiom composition to build formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives, ensuring abstractions are visually and axiomatically supported.

Result: Frontier models GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro excel in compile/semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 leading in physical reasoning; geometry remains difficult.

Conclusion: MMFormalizer offers a scalable framework for multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning across diverse domains.

Abstract: Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into formal statements to enable machine reasoning, faces fundamental challenges in the wild due to the multimodal nature of the physical world, where physics requires inferring hidden constraints (e.g., mass or energy) from visual elements. To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

TL;DR: Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework, enhances longitudinal dementia prognosis by pre-training with clinical indices to improve reasoning about disease progression, achieving strong performance on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of LLMs struggling with longitudinal prediction tasks like dementia prognosis due to complex symptom trajectories and lack of explicit annotations for symptom evolution.

Method: Uses a Cold-Start RL strategy, pre-training the model to predict clinical indices from patient histories, enabling better reasoning about disease progression before final clinical status determination.

Result: Achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world datasets and performs comparably to GPT-4o on the ADNI benchmark, effectively capturing cognitive trajectories.

Conclusion: Dementia-R1 demonstrates the potential of RL-based frameworks for longitudinal prognosis tasks, even with smaller models like the 7B variant, offering a scalable solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on clinical text understanding, they struggle with longitudinal prediction tasks such as dementia prognosis, which require reasoning over complex, non-monotonic symptom trajectories across multiple visits. Standard supervised training lacks explicit annotations for symptom evolution, while direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) is hindered by sparse binary rewards. To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets. Notably, on the ADNI benchmark, our 7B model rivals GPT-4o, effectively capturing fluctuating cognitive trajectories. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dementiar1-CDB5

TL;DR: MedDialogRubrics is a benchmark with 5,200 synthetic patient cases and 60,000 evaluation rubrics, designed to assess LLMs' diagnostic capabilities using multi-agent systems and expert-refined rubrics, highlighting current model challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating medical LLMs lack rigor, necessitating a robust framework to assess information-gathering and diagnostic reasoning abilities.

Method: Developed MedDialogRubrics using synthetic patient cases generated by multi-agent systems, refined by experts, and employed EBM guidelines for rubric generation.

Result: Current models face significant challenges across multiple dimensions, indicating the need for dialogue management architecture improvements.

Conclusion: Advancements in dialogue management, not just model tuning, are essential for enhancing medical LLM performance.

Abstract: Medical conversational AI (AI) plays a pivotal role in the development of safer and more effective medical dialogue systems. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks for assessing the information-gathering and diagnostic reasoning abilities of medical large language models (LLMs) have not been rigorously evaluated. To address these gaps, we present MedDialogRubrics, a novel benchmark comprising 5,200 synthetically constructed patient cases and over 60,000 fine-grained evaluation rubrics generated by LLMs and subsequently refined by clinical experts, specifically designed to assess the multi-turn diagnostic capabilities of LLM. Our framework employs a multi-agent system to synthesize realistic patient records and chief complaints from underlying disease knowledge without accessing real-world electronic health records, thereby mitigating privacy and data-governance concerns. We design a robust Patient Agent that is limited to a set of atomic medical facts and augmented with a dynamic guidance mechanism that continuously detects and corrects hallucinations throughout the dialogue, ensuring internal coherence and clinical plausibility of the simulated cases. Furthermore, we propose a structured LLM-based and expert-annotated rubric-generation pipeline that retrieves Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines and utilizes the reject sampling to derive a prioritized set of rubric items ("must-ask" items) for each case. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and demonstrate that, across multiple assessment dimensions, current models face substantial challenges. Our results indicate that improving medical dialogue will require advances in dialogue management architectures, not just incremental tuning of the base-model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LittiChoQA, a large literary QA dataset for Indic languages, and evaluates multilingual LLMs on non-factoid QA tasks, highlighting performance-efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of long-context QA resources for Indic languages and evaluate multilingual LLMs' performance in literary QA tasks.

Method: Created LittiChoQA, a dataset with 270K question-answer pairs from literary texts, and tested multilingual LLMs (e.g., Krutrim-2) in full-context and shortened-context settings.

Result: Full-context fine-tuning yields the highest scores; context shortening improves throughput. Krutrim-2 performs best (semantic score 76.1 with full context).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates trade-offs between performance and efficiency in literary QA, with Krutrim-2 leading in performance.

Abstract: Long-context question answering (QA) over literary texts poses significant challenges for modern large language models, particularly in low-resource languages. We address the scarcity of long-context QA resources for Indic languages by introducing LittiChoQA, the largest literary QA dataset to date covering many languages spoken in the Gangetic plains of India. The dataset comprises over 270K automatically generated question-answer pairs with a balanced distribution of factoid and non-factoid questions, generated from naturally authored literary texts collected from the open web. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs on non-factoid, abstractive QA, under both full-context and context-shortened settings. Results demonstrate a clear trade-off between performance and efficiency: full-context fine-tuning yields the highest token-level and semantic-level scores, while context shortening substantially improves throughput. Among the evaluated models, Krutrim-2 achieves the strongest performance, obtaining a semantic score of 76.1 with full context. While, in shortened context settings it scores 74.9 with answer paragraph selection and 71.4 with vector-based retrieval. Qualitative evaluations further corroborate these findings.

TL;DR: F-DPO improves factuality in LLMs by correcting misordered preference pairs and adding factuality-aware margins, reducing hallucinations significantly without extra training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment methods like RLHF and DPO can reinforce hallucinations by prioritizing fluency over factual correctness. F-DPO addresses this gap.

Method: F-DPO extends DPO with binary factuality labels, applying label-flipping and factuality-aware margins. It constructs factuality-aware data using synthetic variants.

Result: F-DPO reduces hallucination rates (e.g., 5x reduction) and improves factuality scores (e.g., 50% boost) across multiple LLMs, including out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: F-DPO effectively enhances factuality and reduces hallucinations in LLMs with minimal overhead, outperforming standard DPO.

Abstract: Preference alignment methods such as RLHF and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improve instruction following, but they can also reinforce hallucinations when preference judgments reward fluency and confidence over factual correctness. We introduce F-DPO (Factuality-aware Direct Preference Optimization), a simple extension of DPO that uses only binary factuality labels. F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO reduces hallucination rates by five times (from 0.424 to 0.084) while improving factuality scores by 50 percent (from 5.26 to 7.90). F-DPO also generalizes to out-of-distribution benchmarks: on TruthfulQA, Qwen2.5-14B achieves plus 17 percent MC1 accuracy (0.500 to 0.585) and plus 49 percent MC2 accuracy (0.357 to 0.531). F-DPO requires no auxiliary reward model, token-level annotations, or multi-stage training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes BaseCal, a method to calibrate the confidence of post-trained LLMs (PoLLMs) using their base LLM counterparts, achieving significant improvement in reliability without human labels or model modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-trained LLMs often exhibit severe overconfidence, while their base LLMs remain well-calibrated, prompting the need for a calibration method that leverages the base LLM's reliability.

Method: Two approaches are introduced: BaseCal-ReEval, which evaluates PoLLM responses using the base LLM's probabilities, and BaseCal-Proj, a lightweight projection mapping PoLLM hidden states to base LLM states for confidence derivation.

Result: Experiments show BaseCal reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by an average of 42.90% compared to unsupervised baselines across five datasets and three LLM families.

Conclusion: BaseCal provides an effective, unsupervised solution for improving PoLLM confidence calibration by leveraging base LLMs, without requiring labels or model changes.

Abstract: Reliable confidence is essential for trusting the outputs of LLMs, yet widely deployed post-trained LLMs (PoLLMs) typically compromise this trust with severe overconfidence. In contrast, we observe that their corresponding base LLMs often remain well-calibrated. This naturally motivates us to calibrate PoLLM confidence using the base LLM as a reference. This work proposes two ways to achieve this. A straightforward solution, BaseCal-ReEval, evaluates PoLLM's responses by feeding them into the base LLM to get average probabilities as confidence. While effective, this approach introduces additional inference overhead. To address this, we propose BaseCal-Proj, which trains a lightweight projection to map the final-layer hidden states of PoLLMs back to those of their base LLMs. These projected states are then processed by the base LLM's output layer to derive base-calibrated confidence for PoLLM's responses. Notably, BaseCal is an unsupervised, plug-and-play solution that operates without human labels or LLM modifications. Experiments across five datasets and three LLM families demonstrate the effectiveness of BaseCal, reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by an average of 42.90\% compared to the best unsupervised baselines.

TL;DR: The paper identifies a paradox where sparse-attention algorithms increase end-to-end complexity ("Less is Less" or Lil) and proposes an early-stopping algorithm to mitigate it, reducing token use by up to 90% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) demand efficient inference, but sparse-attention methods can inadvertently increase latency by causing longer sequences due to information loss.

Method: The authors propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects when information loss outweighs gain during sparse decoding.

Result: The algorithm reduces token consumption by up to 90% with less than 2% accuracy degradation on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sparse attention can be optimized with early-stopping to balance efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities across a wide range of complex tasks and are increasingly deployed at scale, placing significant demands on inference efficiency. Prior work typically decomposes inference into prefill and decode stages, with the decode stage dominating total latency. To reduce time and memory complexity in the decode stage, a line of work introduces sparse-attention algorithms. In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding. Our early-stopping algorithm reduces token consumption by up to 90% with a marginal accuracy degradation of less than 2% across reasoning-intensive benchmarks.

TL;DR: A graph-based method detects hallucinations in multi-turn conversations by modeling dialogues as nodes with shared-entity and temporal edges, achieving slightly better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations in conversational AI systems, especially in multi-turn dialogues where context changes and contradictions arise.

Method: Dialogue turns are represented as nodes in a temporal graph, encoded with a sentence transformer. Shared-entity and temporal edges connect nodes, followed by message-passing and attention pooling for classification.

Result: The method slightly outperforms existing techniques and provides interpretability via attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach effectively detects dialogue-level hallucinations while offering insights into the decision-making process.

Abstract: Hallucinations can be produced by conversational AI systems, particularly in multi-turn conversations where context changes and contradictions may eventually surface. By representing the entire conversation as a temporal graph, we present a novel graph-based method for detecting dialogue-level hallucinations. Our framework models each dialogue as a node, encoding it using a sentence transformer. We explore two different ways of connectivity: i) shared-entity edges, which connect turns that refer to the same entities; ii) temporal edges, which connect contiguous turns in the conversation. Message-passing is used to update the node embeddings, allowing flow of information between related nodes. The context-aware node embeddings are then combined using attention pooling into a single vector, which is then passed on to a classifier to determine the presence and type of hallucinations. We demonstrate that our method offers slightly improved performance over existing methods. Further, we show the attention mechanism can be used to justify the decision making process.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic-level internal reasoning graph method to detect faithfulness hallucinations in RAG systems, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faithfulness hallucinations persist in RAG systems, and existing methods inadequately capture internal reasoning processes or handle features coarsely.

Method: Extends layer-wise relevance propagation to semantic level, constructs reasoning graphs, and designs a framework for dynamic threshold adjustment.

Result: Achieves superior performance on RAGTruth and Dolly-15k datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively detects faithfulness hallucinations by leveraging semantic-level reasoning dependencies.

Abstract: The Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on Large language model (LLM) has made significant progress. It can effectively reduce factuality hallucinations, but faithfulness hallucinations still exist. Previous methods for detecting faithfulness hallucinations either neglect to capture the models' internal reasoning processes or handle those features coarsely, making it difficult for discriminators to learn. This paper proposes a semantic-level internal reasoning graph-based method for detecting faithfulness hallucination. Specifically, we first extend the layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm from the token level to the semantic level, constructing an internal reasoning graph based on attribution vectors. This provides a more faithful semantic-level representation of dependency. Furthermore, we design a general framework based on a small pre-trained language model to utilize the dependencies in LLM's reasoning for training and hallucination detection, which can dynamically adjust the pass rate of correct samples through a threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better overall performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on RAGTruth and Dolly-15k.

*Janvijay Singh,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces greedy pruning, a method to shorten reasoning chains in large language models while preserving likelihood, and shows it outperforms baseline methods in distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of insight into whether models encode token-level functional importance for answer generation and reduce computational costs of long reasoning chains.

Method: Proposes greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens with minimal impact on model likelihood.

Result: Students trained on pruned chains outperform frontier-model-supervised compression baselines at matched reasoning lengths. Attention scores predict pruning ranks, indicating functional importance structure.

Conclusion: Greedy pruning effectively compresses reasoning chains and reveals models encode functional importance over tokens.

Abstract: Large language models solve complex tasks by generating long reasoning chains, achieving higher accuracy at the cost of increased computational cost and reduced ability to isolate functionally relevant reasoning. Prior work on compact reasoning shortens such chains through probabilistic sampling, heuristics, or supervision from frontier models, but offers limited insight into whether models internally encode token-level functional importance for answer generation. We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths. Finally, our analysis reveals systematic pruning patterns and shows that attention scores can predict greedy pruning ranks, further suggesting that models encode a nontrivial functional importance structure over reasoning tokens.

### [125] [Learning to Diagnose and Correct Moral Errors: Towards Enhancing Moral Sensitivity in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03079)
*Bocheng Chen,Han Zi,Xi Chen,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Johnson,Guangliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing moral sensitivity in large language models (LLMs) using pragmatic inference methods to diagnose and correct moral errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moral sensitivity is crucial for human behavior, and aligning LLMs with human moral values is challenging. The paper aims to address how to improve moral sensitivity in LLMs.

Method: Two pragmatic inference methods are proposed to help LLMs diagnose morally benign and hazardous inputs and correct moral errors by focusing on inferential loads rather than diverse surface forms.

Result: Empirical evidence shows the methods improve moral sensitivity in LLMs and perform well on morality-related benchmarks.

Conclusion: The pragmatic inference methods effectively enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs, providing a unified and principled approach.

Abstract: Moral sensitivity is fundamental to human moral competence, as it guides individuals in regulating everyday behavior. Although many approaches seek to align large language models (LLMs) with human moral values, how to enable them morally sensitive has been extremely challenging. In this paper, we take a step toward answering the question: how can we enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs? Specifically, we propose two pragmatic inference methods that faciliate LLMs to diagnose morally benign and hazardous input and correct moral errors, whereby enhancing LLMs' moral sensitivity. A central strength of our pragmatic inference methods is their unified perspective: instead of modeling moral discourses across semantically diverse and complex surface forms, they offer a principled perspective for designing pragmatic inference procedures grounded in their inferential loads. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our pragmatic methods can enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs and achieves strong performance on representative morality-relevant benchmarks.

### [126] [Grad-ELLM: Gradient-based Explanations for Decoder-only LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03089)
*Xin Huang,Antoni B. Chan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Grad-ELLM is a gradient-based attribution method for LLMs that combines gradients and attention maps to generate faithful input attribution heatmaps, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparency and faithfulness in existing model-agnostic attribution methods for transformer-based LLMs.

Method: Proposes Grad-ELLM, combining gradients (channel importance) and attention maps (spatial importance) to generate attribution heatmaps without modifying the model architecture. Introduces two faithfulness metrics ($π$-Soft-NC and $π$-Soft-NS).

Result: Outperforms other attribution methods in faithfulness across sentiment classification, question answering, and open-generation tasks.

Conclusion: Grad-ELLM provides a more faithful and transparent attribution method tailored for decoder-only transformer-based LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency and faithfulness. Input attribution methods aim to highlight each input token's contributions to the model's output, but existing approaches are typically model-agnostic, and do not focus on transformer-specific architectures, leading to limited faithfulness. To address this, we propose Grad-ELLM, a gradient-based attribution method for decoder-only transformer-based LLMs. By aggregating channel importance from gradients of the output logit with respect to attention layers and spatial importance from attention maps, Grad-ELLM generates heatmaps at each generation step without requiring architectural modifications. Additionally, we introduce two faithfulneses metrics $π$-Soft-NC and $π$-Soft-NS, which are modifications of Soft-NC/NS that provide fairer comparisons by controlling the amount of information kept when perturbing the text. We evaluate Grad-ELLM on sentiment classification, question answering, and open-generation tasks using different models. Experiment results show that Grad-ELLM consistently achieves superior faithfulness than other attribution methods.

### [127] [Discovering and Causally Validating Emotion-Sensitive Neurons in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03115)
*Xiutian Zhao,Björn Schuller,Berrak Sisman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates emotion-sensitive neurons (ESNs) in large audio-language models (LALMs) like Qwen2.5-Omni, Kimi-Audio, and Audio Flamingo 3, revealing their causal role in emotion recognition and controllable affective behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion is crucial in spoken communication, but how modern LALMs encode it internally remains unclear. This gap motivates a neuron-level interpretability study.

Method: The research identifies ESNs using frequency-, entropy-, magnitude-, and contrast-based selectors across three models. Inference-time interventions (ablation and amplification) test their causal role in emotion recognition.

Result: Ablating ESNs degrades recognition of specific emotions, while amplifying them steers predictions toward targeted emotions. ESNs show non-uniform layer-wise clustering and partial cross-dataset transfer.

Conclusion: The study provides causal evidence for ESNs in LALMs, offering actionable insights for controllable affective behaviors through targeted neuron interventions.

Abstract: Emotion is a central dimension of spoken communication, yet, we still lack a mechanistic account of how modern large audio-language models (LALMs) encode it internally. We present the first neuron-level interpretability study of emotion-sensitive neurons (ESNs) in LALMs and provide causal evidence that such units exist in Qwen2.5-Omni, Kimi-Audio, and Audio Flamingo 3. Across these three widely used open-source models, we compare frequency-, entropy-, magnitude-, and contrast-based neuron selectors on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks. Using inference-time interventions, we reveal a consistent emotion-specific signature: ablating neurons selected for a given emotion disproportionately degrades recognition of that emotion while largely preserving other classes, whereas gain-based amplification steers predictions toward the target emotion. These effects arise with modest identification data and scale systematically with intervention strength. We further observe that ESNs exhibit non-uniform layer-wise clustering with partial cross-dataset transfer. Taken together, our results offer a causal, neuron-level account of emotion decisions in LALMs and highlight targeted neuron interventions as an actionable handle for controllable affective behaviors.

*Peiran Li,Jan Fillies,Adrian Paschke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToxiGAN is a class-aware text augmentation framework combining adversarial generation and LLM semantic guidance, outperforming traditional methods on toxicity classification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving robustness in toxicity classification by addressing challenges like limited supervision and distributional skew.

Method: Combines adversarial generation with LLM semantic guidance, using a two-step directional training strategy and LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast.

Result: Achieves strongest average performance on hate speech benchmarks in macro-F1 and hate-F1, outperforming other augmentation methods.

Conclusion: Semantic ballast and directional training enhance classifier robustness, validating ToxiGAN's effectiveness.

Abstract: Augmenting toxic language data in a controllable and class-specific manner is crucial for improving robustness in toxicity classification, yet remains challenging due to limited supervision and distributional skew. We propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework that combines adversarial generation with semantic guidance from large language models (LLMs). To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further confirm the benefits of semantic ballast and directional training in enhancing classifier robustness.

*Xiangzhe Yuan,Zhenhao Zhang,Haoming Tang,Siying Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs pose new risks in multi-turn scams, which single-turn evaluations miss. A study using LLM-to-LLM simulations reveals recurring scam patterns, effective defenses, and common failure modes like safety guardrails and role instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the novel risks posed by LLMs in multi-turn conversational scams, which are not captured by single-turn safety evaluations.

Method: A controlled LLM-to-LLM simulation framework was used to study multi-turn scam scenarios, evaluating eight state-of-the-art models in English and Chinese. Dialogue outcomes were analyzed, and attacker strategies, defensive responses, and failure modes were qualitatively annotated.

Result: Scam interactions follow recurrent escalation patterns, while defenses use verification and delay mechanisms. Failures often arise from safety guardrail activation and role instability.

Conclusion: Multi-turn interactional safety is a critical and distinct dimension of LLM behavior, highlighting the need for tailored evaluations.

Abstract: As LLMs gain persuasive agentic capabilities through extended dialogues, they introduce novel risks in multi-turn conversational scams that single-turn safety evaluations fail to capture. We systematically study these risks using a controlled LLM-to-LLM simulation framework across multi-turn scam scenarios. Evaluating eight state-of-the-art models in English and Chinese, we analyze dialogue outcomes and qualitatively annotate attacker strategies, defensive responses, and failure modes. Results reveal that scam interactions follow recurrent escalation patterns, while defenses employ verification and delay mechanisms. Furthermore, interactional failures frequently stem from safety guardrail activation and role instability. Our findings highlight multi-turn interactional safety as a critical, distinct dimension of LLM behavior.

### [130] [Improving Indigenous Language Machine Translation with Synthetic Data and Language-Specific Preprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03135)
*Aashish Dhawan,Christopher Driggers-Ellis,Christan Grant,Daisy Zhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores synthetic data augmentation to improve NMT for low-resource indigenous languages, showing consistent improvements in Guarani--Spanish and Quechua--Spanish translation but highlighting limitations for highly agglutinative languages like Aymara.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource indigenous languages lack parallel corpora, necessitating synthetic data generation to enhance NMT performance.

Method: Augments curated datasets with synthetic pairs using a multilingual translation model (mBART) and applies language-specific preprocessing (orthographic normalization, noise-aware filtering).

Result: Synthetic data improves chrF++ scores for Guarani--Spanish and Quechua--Spanish, but preprocessing limitations are noted for Aymara.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augments NMT effectively for some indigenous languages, though challenges remain for highly agglutinative ones.

Abstract: Low-resource indigenous languages often lack the parallel corpora required for effective neural machine translation (NMT). Synthetic data generation offers a practical strategy for mitigating this limitation in data-scarce settings. In this work, we augment curated parallel datasets for indigenous languages of the Americas with synthetic sentence pairs generated using a high-capacity multilingual translation model. We fine-tune a multilingual mBART model on curated-only and synthetically augmented data and evaluate translation quality using chrF++, the primary metric used in recent AmericasNLP shared tasks for agglutinative languages.
  We further apply language-specific preprocessing, including orthographic normalization and noise-aware filtering, to reduce corpus artifacts. Experiments on Guarani--Spanish and Quechua--Spanish translation show consistent chrF++ improvements from synthetic data augmentation, while diagnostic experiments on Aymara highlight the limitations of generic preprocessing for highly agglutinative languages.

*Selma Wanna,Agnes Luhtaru,Jonathan Salfity,Ryan Barron,Juston Moore,Cynthia Matuszek,Mitch Pryor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically audits the linguistic characteristics of Vision-Language-Action datasets, revealing repetitive, template-like commands and limited structural variation. It aims to improve dataset reporting, selection, and augmentation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of documentation on linguistic features in VLA datasets, crucial for training and evaluating models effectively.

Method: The audit involves quantifying instruction language across dimensions like lexical variety, duplication, semantic similarity, and syntactic complexity in widely used VLA corpora.

Result: Findings show VLA datasets often contain repetitive, low-variety instructions, narrowing the distribution of linguistic forms.

Conclusion: The analysis highlights the need for better dataset reporting, selection, and targeted augmentation to enhance linguistic diversity in VLA models.

Abstract: Language plays a critical role in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet the linguistic characteristics of the datasets used to train and evaluate these systems remain poorly documented. In this work, we present a systematic dataset audit of several widely used VLA corpora, aiming to characterize what kinds of instructions these datasets actually contain and how much linguistic variety they provide. We quantify instruction language along complementary dimensions-including lexical variety, duplication and overlap, semantic similarity, and syntactic complexity. Our analysis shows that many datasets rely on highly repetitive, template-like commands with limited structural variation, yielding a narrow distribution of instruction forms. We position these findings as descriptive documentation of the language signal available in current VLA training and evaluation data, intended to support more detailed dataset reporting, more principled dataset selection, and targeted curation or augmentation strategies that broaden language coverage.

### [132] [Self-Verification is All You Need To Pass The Japanese Bar Examination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03144)
*Andrew Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-verification model that passes the Japanese bar exam by faithfully replicating its format and scoring, outperforming alternative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of LLMs performing reliably on highly professional exams like the Japanese bar exam, which requires strict adherence to complex formats.

Method: A self-verification model trained on a dataset replicating the exam's authentic format and evaluation scale.

Result: The model exceeded the official passing score, outperforming multi-agent inference and decomposition-based methods.

Conclusion: Faithful supervision and consistency verification are crucial, and single-model approaches can surpass complex systems in professional tasks.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on highly professional and structured examinations remains a significant challenge. The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions. While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam. Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules. We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance. Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks. Our dataset and codes are publicly available.

*Beiduo Chen,Tiancheng Hu,Caiqi Zhang,Robert Litschko,Anna Korhonen,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reasoning-tuned LLMs with long CoT excel at single-answer tasks but struggle with Human Label Variation. Cross-CoT experiments reveal CoT improves alignment but relies on priors for ranking, showing CoT's limited role as a distribution calibrator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs handle probabilistic ambiguity in Human Label Variation tasks, contrasting their deterministic reasoning strengths.

Method: Conducted Cross-CoT experiments to disentangle reasoning text effects from model priors on distribution-based tasks, analyzing step-wise contributions.

Result: CoT enhances alignment (99% accuracy variance) but priors dominate ranking (80%). CoT's accuracy impact grows monotonically, while priors shape distributional structure.

Conclusion: Long CoT acts as a top-option decision-maker but lacks granular calibration for ambiguous tasks, highlighting its limitations.

Abstract: Reasoning-tuned LLMs utilizing long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) excel at single-answer tasks, yet their ability to model Human Label Variation--which requires capturing probabilistic ambiguity rather than resolving it--remains underexplored. We investigate this through systematic disentanglement experiments on distribution-based tasks, employing Cross-CoT experiments to isolate the effect of reasoning text from intrinsic model priors. We observe a distinct "decoupled mechanism": while CoT improves distributional alignment, final accuracy is dictated by CoT content (99% variance contribution), whereas distributional ranking is governed by model priors (over 80%). Step-wise analysis further shows that while CoT's influence on accuracy grows monotonically during the reasoning process, distributional structure is largely determined by LLM's intrinsic priors. These findings suggest that long CoT serves as a decisive LLM decision-maker for the top option but fails to function as a granular distribution calibrator for ambiguous tasks.

*Yu Xinmiao,Zhang Liwen,Feng Xiaocheng,Jiang Yong,Qin Bing,Xie Pengjun,Zhou Jingren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework addressing plan anchor issue in LLM-based agents, improving long-horizon web reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods struggle with long-horizon strategies due to plan anchor phenomenon, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior.

Method: Anchor-GRPO decouples planning and execution: Stage 1 optimizes first-step planning using self-play and human calibration; Stage 2 aligns execution with sparse rewards.

Result: Outperforms baselines on benchmarks (BrowseComp, GAIA, etc.), with WebAnchor-30B achieving 46.0% pass@1 on BrowseComp and 76.4% on GAIA.

Conclusion: Anchor-GRPO improves task success and tool efficiency, scales well with model size and context length.

Abstract: Large Language Model(LLM)-based agents have shown strong capabilities in web information seeking, with reinforcement learning (RL) becoming a key optimization paradigm. However, planning remains a bottleneck, as existing methods struggle with long-horizon strategies. Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon, plan anchor, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior in long-horizon web reasoning tasks. Current RL algorithms, fail to account for this by uniformly distributing rewards across the trajectory. To address this, we propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that decouples planning and execution. In Stage 1, the agent optimizes its first-step planning using fine-grained rubrics derived from self-play experiences and human calibration. In Stage 2, execution is aligned with the initial plan through sparse rewards, ensuring stable and efficient tool usage. We evaluate Anchor-GRPO on four benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch. Across models from 3B to 30B, Anchor-GRPO outperforms baseline GRPO and First-step GRPO, improving task success and tool efficiency. Notably, WebAnchor-30B achieves 46.0% pass@1 on BrowseComp and 76.4% on GAIA. Anchor-GRPO also demonstrates strong scalability, getting higher accuracy as model size and context length increase.

*Tewodros Kederalah Idris,Prasenjit Mitra,Roald Eiselen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates embedding similarity metrics for cross-lingual transfer in African languages, finding cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics effective, while emphasizing model-specific validation due to Simpson's Paradox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable methods for selecting source languages in cross-lingual transfer for low-resource African languages, ensuring effective NLP system development.

Method: Systematic evaluation of five embedding similarity metrics across 816 transfer experiments involving three NLP tasks, three multilingual models, and 12 languages from four families.

Result: Cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics (P@1, CSLS) showed reliable predictive power (ρ=0.4-0.6), while CKA was ineffective (ρ≈0.1). Simpson's Paradox revealed reversed correlations when pooling across models.

Conclusion: Embedding metrics perform comparably to linguistic typology for source language selection, but practitioners must validate results per-model due to Simpson's Paradox.

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer is essential for building NLP systems for low-resource African languages, but practitioners lack reliable methods for selecting source languages. We systematically evaluate five embedding similarity metrics across 816 transfer experiments spanning three NLP tasks, three African-centric multilingual models, and 12 languages from four language families. We find that cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics (P@1, CSLS) reliably predict transfer success ($ρ= 0.4-0.6$), while CKA shows negligible predictive power ($ρ\approx 0.1$). Critically, correlation signs reverse when pooling across models (Simpson's Paradox), so practitioners must validate per-model. Embedding metrics achieve comparable predictive power to URIEL linguistic typology. Our results provide concrete guidance for source language selection and highlight the importance of model-specific analysis.

*Naixin Zhai,Pengyang Shao,Binbin Zheng,Fei Shen,Long Bai,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PALU is a novel framework for machine unlearning in LLMs that focuses on localized entropy maximization to forget sensitive knowledge efficiently, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning approaches treat all tokens uniformly, leading to unnecessary utility loss and inefficient optimization. PALU addresses this by targeting only critical regions.

Method: PALU uses a local entropy maximization objective across temporal and vocabulary dimensions, suppressing sensitive prefixes and flattening top-k logits to sever causal links and maximize uncertainty.

Result: PALU achieves better forgetting efficacy and utility preservation compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Localized unlearning, as demonstrated by PALU, is more efficient and effective than global approaches for forgetting sensitive knowledge in LLMs.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to forget sensitive knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining general utility. However, existing approaches typically treat all tokens in a response indiscriminately and enforce uncertainty over the entire vocabulary. This global treatment results in unnecessary utility degradation and extends optimization to content-agnostic regions. To address these limitations, we propose PALU (Prefix-Aware Localized Unlearning), a framework driven by a local entropy maximization objective across both temporal and vocabulary dimensions. PALU reveals that (i) suppressing the sensitive prefix alone is sufficient to sever the causal generation link, and (ii) flattening only the top-$k$ logits is adequate to maximize uncertainty in the critical subspace. These findings allow PALU to avoid redundant optimization across the full vocabulary and parameter space while minimizing collateral damage to general model performance. Extensive experiments validate that PALU achieves superior forgetting efficacy and utility preservation compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemRL, a framework that enables self-evolution in agents using non-parametric reinforcement learning on episodic memory, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with self-evolution due to computational costs and catastrophic forgetting. Existing memory-based methods often retrieve noise, necessitating a more effective solution.

Method: MemRL separates stable reasoning (using a frozen LLM) from evolving memory. It employs a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism—filtering candidates by semantic relevance and selecting based on learned Q-values (utility) refined via environmental feedback.

Result: MemRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmarks like HLE, BigCodeBench, ALFWorld, and Lifelong Agent Bench, effectively addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma.

Conclusion: MemRL enables continuous runtime improvement without weight updates, paving the way for more adaptive and efficient AI agents.

Abstract: The hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to master new skills through Constructive Episodic Simulation-retrieving past experiences to synthesize solutions for novel tasks. While Large Language Models possess strong reasoning capabilities, they struggle to emulate this self-evolution: fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, while existing memory-based methods rely on passive semantic matching that often retrieves noise. To address these challenges, we propose MemRL, a framework that enables agents to self-evolve via non-parametric reinforcement learning on episodic memory. MemRL explicitly separates the stable reasoning of a frozen LLM from the plastic, evolving memory. Unlike traditional methods, MemRL employs a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism that filters candidates by semantic relevance and then selects them based on learned Q-values (utility). These utilities are continuously refined via environmental feedback in an trial-and-error manner, allowing the agent to distinguish high-value strategies from similar noise. Extensive experiments on HLE, BigCodeBench, ALFWorld, and Lifelong Agent Bench demonstrate that MemRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis experiments confirm that MemRL effectively reconciles the stability-plasticity dilemma, enabling continuous runtime improvement without weight updates.

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-MuTeST, an explainability-guided framework for hate speech detection in Indic and English languages, combining LLM reasoning with attention techniques and leveraging human-annotated rationales for improved accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in accuracy and explainability for hate speech detection, especially in underexplored Indic languages like Hindi and Telugu.

Method: Proposes X-MuTeST, which combines LLM semantic reasoning with attention techniques and uses human-annotated rationales. It computes explanations via prediction probability differences between original text and n-grams.

Result: Leveraging human rationales enhances classification and explainability. Combining rationales with X-MuTeST refines model attention, improving performance. Metrics include Plausibility (Token-F1, IOU-F1) and Faithfulness (Comprehensiveness, Sufficiency).

Conclusion: X-MuTeST advances hate speech detection in diverse languages by integrating human rationales and explainability methods, with datasets available for Hindi, Telugu, and English.

Abstract: Hate speech detection on social media faces challenges in both accuracy and explainability, especially for underexplored Indic languages. We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (eXplainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines high-level semantic reasoning from large language models (LLMs) with traditional attention-enhancing techniques. We extend this research to Hindi and Telugu alongside English by providing benchmark human-annotated rationales for each word to justify the assigned class label. The X-MuTeST explainability method computes the difference between the prediction probabilities of the original text and those of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Final explanations are computed as the union between LLM explanations and X-MuTeST explanations. We show that leveraging human rationales during training enhances both classification performance and explainability. Moreover, combining human rationales with our explainability method to refine the model attention yields further improvements. We evaluate explainability using Plausibility metrics such as Token-F1 and IOU-F1 and Faithfulness metrics such as Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. By focusing on under-resourced languages, our work advances hate speech detection across diverse linguistic contexts. Our dataset includes token-level rationale annotations for 6,004 Hindi, 4,492 Telugu, and 6,334 English samples. Data and code are available on https://github.com/ziarehman30/X-MuTeST

TL;DR: DIP dynamically optimizes in-context examples during generation for DLMs, achieving significant speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost of DLMs due to bidirectional attention by leveraging their unique diffusion generation paradigm.

Method: Propose Dynamic In-Context Planner (DIP) to dynamically select and insert in-context examples during generation.

Result: DIP achieves up to 12.9x speedup over standard inference and 1.17x over KV cache-enhanced inference while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: DIP efficiently reduces computational overhead in DLMs without compromising generation performance.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have shown strong potential for general natural language tasks with in-context examples. However, due to the bidirectional attention mechanism, DLMs incur substantial computational cost as context length increases. This work addresses this issue with a key discovery: unlike the sequential generation in autoregressive language models (ARLMs), the diffusion generation paradigm in DLMs allows \textit{efficient dynamic adjustment of the context} during generation. Building on this insight, we propose \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{I}n-Context \textbf{P}lanner (DIP), a context-optimization method that dynamically selects and inserts in-context examples during generation, rather than providing all examples in the prompt upfront. Results show DIP maintains generation quality while achieving up to 12.9$\times$ inference speedup over standard inference and 1.17$\times$ over KV cache-enhanced inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UltraLogic is a framework designed to automate high-quality data production for general reasoning tasks by decoupling logical problems from natural language. It uses Code-based Solving, diverse task types, and a Bipolar Float Reward mechanism to improve training efficiency and reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex general-purpose reasoning remains a bottleneck for LLMs, and there's a lack of large-scale, difficulty-calibrated data for such tasks.

Method: UltraLogic decouples logic from language via Code-based Solving, includes diverse task types, and introduces the Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism for graded penalties.

Result: Experiments show task diversity enhances reasoning, and BFR with difficulty matching significantly boosts training efficiency.

Conclusion: UltraLogic addresses data scarcity and reward challenges, improving reasoning capabilities and training effectiveness.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in natural language processing , complex general-purpose reasoning requiring multi-step logic, planning, and verification remains a critical bottleneck. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has succeeded in specific domains , the field lacks large-scale, high-quality, and difficulty-calibrated data for general reasoning. To address this, we propose UltraLogic, a framework that decouples the logical core of a problem from its natural language expression through a Code-based Solving methodology to automate high-quality data production. The framework comprises hundreds of unique task types and an automated calibration pipeline across ten difficulty levels. Furthermore, to mitigate binary reward sparsity and the Non-negative Reward Trap, we introduce the Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism, utilizing graded penalties to effectively distinguish perfect responses from those with logical flaws. Our experiments demonstrate that task diversity is the primary driver for reasoning enhancement , and that BFR, combined with a difficulty matching strategy, significantly improves training efficiency, guiding models toward global logical optima.

### [141] [MalruleLib: Large-Scale Executable Misconception Reasoning with Step Traces for Modeling Student Thinking in Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03217)
*Xinghe Chen,Naiming Liu,Shashank Sonkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MalruleLib is a framework that translates systematic student misconceptions in mathematics into executable procedures, generating step-by-step traces of incorrect work. It evaluates language models' ability to predict these misconceptions and improves prediction accuracy with student step traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need to systematically model and understand student mistakes in mathematics to improve educational AI tools for diagnosis and feedback.

Method: MalruleLib formalizes student misconceptions as executable procedures, drawing on 67 sources, and evaluates language models' performance on the Malrule Reasoning Accuracy (MRA) task.

Result: Language models' accuracy drops from 66% to 40% on cross-template misconception prediction. MalruleLib generates over one million instances, improving prediction with step traces by 3-15%.

Conclusion: MalruleLib serves as scalable infrastructure for educational AI, enabling targeted diagnosis and feedback by modeling student misconceptions across contexts.

Abstract: Student mistakes in mathematics are often systematic: a learner applies a coherent but wrong procedure and repeats it across contexts. We introduce MalruleLib, a learning-science-grounded framework that translates documented misconceptions into executable procedures, drawing on 67 learning-science and mathematics education sources, and generates step-by-step traces of malrule-consistent student work. We formalize a core student-modeling problem as Malrule Reasoning Accuracy (MRA): infer a misconception from one worked mistake and predict the student's next answer under cross-template rephrasing. Across nine language models (4B-120B), accuracy drops from 66% on direct problem solving to 40% on cross-template misconception prediction. MalruleLib encodes 101 malrules over 498 parameterized problem templates and produces paired dual-path traces for both correct reasoning and malrule-consistent student reasoning. Because malrules are executable and templates are parameterizable, MalruleLib can generate over one million instances, enabling scalable supervision and controlled evaluation. Using MalruleLib, we observe cross-template degradations of 10-21%, while providing student step traces improves prediction by 3-15%. We release MalruleLib as infrastructure for educational AI that models student procedures across contexts, enabling diagnosis and feedback that targets the underlying misconception.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic benchmark for multi-RADS frameworks, comparing small and proprietary language models' performance in RADS assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of RADS guidelines and lack of benchmarking across frameworks motivate creating a standardized benchmark for evaluating model performance.

Method: Developed RXL-RADSet with 1,600 synthetic reports across 10 RADS frameworks, tested 41 SLMs and GPT-5.2 under guided prompting, and assessed validity and accuracy.

Result: GPT-5.2 outperformed SLMs (~81% accuracy), but top SLMs (20-32B parameters) achieved ~99% validity and mid-70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size and declined with RADS complexity.

Conclusion: RXL-RADSet is a valuable benchmark; large SLMs can approach proprietary-model performance under guided prompting, though gaps persist for complex RADS schemes.

Abstract: Background: Reporting and Data Systems (RADS) standardize radiology risk communication but automated RADS assignment from narrative reports is challenging because of guideline complexity, output-format constraints, and limited benchmarking across RADS frameworks and model sizes. Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs. Guided prompting improved validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot. Conclusion: RXL-RADSet provides a radiologist-verified multi-RADS benchmark; large SLMs (20-32B) can approach proprietary-model performance under guided prompting, but gaps remain for higher-complexity schemes.

*Juntong Ni,Shiyu Wang,Ming Jin,Qi He,Wei Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ST-Bench and STReasoner address the underdeveloped field of spatio-temporal reasoning by introducing benchmarks and a model integrating time series, graph structure, and text, achieving significant accuracy gains cost-effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatio-temporal reasoning lacks explicit synthesis of temporal dynamics, spatial dependencies, and textual context, which is critical for high-stakes decision-making in systems like traffic networks and disease propagation.

Method: Introduced ST-Bench with four core tasks developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline, and proposed STReasoner integrating time series, graph structure, and text for reasoning. Also introduced S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm rewarding spatial information use.

Result: STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and benchmark effectively advance spatio-temporal reasoning, demonstrating cost efficiency and robustness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal reasoning in time series involves the explicit synthesis of temporal dynamics, spatial dependencies, and textual context. This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.

*Bastien Vanderplaetse,Xavier Siebert,Stéphane Dupont*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ASRD, an algorithm for interpreting emergent languages in multi-agent systems by detecting semantic patterns tied to input data attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of focus on interpretability in emergent communication, aiming to simplify analysis of agent-developed languages.

Method: The ASRD algorithm analyzes messages from agents trained on Lewis Game datasets, identifying semantic rules linked to data attributes.

Result: ASRD successfully extracts meaningful patterns, aiding in the interpretation of emergent communication strategies.

Conclusion: The ASRD algorithm enhances understanding of emergent languages, facilitating easier analysis and application in varied environments.

Abstract: The field of emergent communication within multi-agent systems examines how autonomous agents can independently develop communication strategies, without explicit programming, and adapt them to varied environments. However, few studies have focused on the interpretability of emergent languages. The research exposed in this paper proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm, which extracts relevant patterns in messages exchanged by agents trained with two different datasets on the Lewis Game, which is often studied in the context of emergent communication. ASRD helps at the interpretation of the emergent communication by relating the extracted patterns to specific attributes of the input data, thereby considerably simplifying subsequent analysis.

### [145] [Physical Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02433)
*Tao Xu,Zhixin Hu,Li Luo,Momiao Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 'physical transformer' that integrates transformer-style computation with geometric and physical dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap between digital AI and physical interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems operate primarily in virtual spaces, lacking physical interpretation. The work seeks to develop AI models that combine digital reasoning with physical grounding for improved interpretability and real-world applicability.

Method: The approach involves hierarchical modeling: micro-level (spin interactions), meso-level (Neural Differential Manifold under Hamiltonian flows), and macro-level (generative semantic workspace). Reasoning tasks are framed as controlled information flows on the manifold.

Result: The physical transformer shows better stability and long-horizon accuracy on toy problems like numerical integration and dynamical systems compared to naive baselines.

Conclusion: The framework offers a pathway toward physically grounded AI, unifying digital reasoning with physical manifolds for more interpretable and unified models of reasoning and real-world interaction.

Abstract: Digital AI systems spanning large language models, vision models, and generative architectures that operate primarily in symbolic, linguistic, or pixel domains. They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world.

### [146] [WebGym: Scaling Training Environments for Visual Web Agents with Realistic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02439)
*Hao Bai,Alexey Taymanov,Tong Zhang,Aviral Kumar,Spencer Whitehead*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WebGym is the largest open-source environment for training visual web agents, featuring 300,000 tasks on diverse real websites. A simple RL method, combined with a high-throughput rollout system, achieves significant speedups and performance improvements, outperforming proprietary models like GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking on unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing small-scale or artificial task sets fail to address the non-stationary and diverse nature of real websites, necessitating a large-scale, realistic environment like WebGym for robust web agent training.

Method: The paper proposes a simple RL approach using task rewards and interaction traces. It also introduces a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system to accelerate trajectory sampling and scales task breadth, depth, and size for better performance.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct on WebGym improves success rates from 26.2% to 42.9% on unseen tasks, surpassing proprietary models (27.1% for GPT-4o, 29.8% for GPT-5-Thinking). The rollout system achieves a 4-5x speedup.

Conclusion: WebGym's large-scale, diverse tasks and efficient RL training methodology enable significant advancements in visual web agent performance, particularly on challenging, real-world, out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: We present WebGym, the largest-to-date open-source environment for training realistic visual web agents. Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.

*Subhankar Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: mHC-GNN adapts Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections to GNNs, reducing over-smoothing and enhancing expressiveness beyond 1-WL, with significant performance gains at extreme depths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address over-smoothing and limited expressiveness (bounded by 1-WL) in deep GNN architectures.

Method: Expand node representations across parallel streams and constrain stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope using Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization.

Result: Achieves exponentially slower over-smoothing (rate $(1-γ)^{L/n}$ vs. $(1-γ)^L$), distinguishes graphs beyond 1-WL, and maintains over 74% accuracy at 128 layers.

Conclusion: mHC-GNN significantly improves performance and robustness in deep GNNs, with the manifold constraint being crucial.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing in deep architectures and expressiveness bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test. We adapt Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (\mhc)~\citep{xie2025mhc}, recently proposed for Transformers, to graph neural networks. Our method, mHC-GNN, expands node representations across $n$ parallel streams and constrains stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope via Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization. We prove that mHC-GNN exhibits exponentially slower over-smoothing (rate $(1-γ)^{L/n}$ vs.\ $(1-γ)^L$) and can distinguish graphs beyond 1-WL. Experiments on 10 datasets with 4 GNN architectures show consistent improvements. Depth experiments from 2 to 128 layers reveal that standard GNNs collapse to near-random performance beyond 16 layers, while mHC-GNN maintains over 74\% accuracy even at 128 layers, with improvements exceeding 50 percentage points at extreme depths. Ablations confirm that the manifold constraint is essential: removing it causes up to 82\% performance degradation.

### [148] [Polynomial Convergence of Riemannian Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02499)
*Xingyu Xu,Ziyi Zhang,Yorie Nakahira,Guannan Qu,Yuejie Chi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper strengthens the theory of Riemannian diffusion models by proving that a polynomially small step size suffices for small sampling error under $L_2$-accurate score estimates, relaxing previous requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models assume Euclidean spaces, but real-world data often lie on submanifolds. The paper aims to improve the theoretical understanding of diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces.

Method: The approach leverages Li-Yau estimates and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion to analyze perturbed heat equations on manifolds.

Result: Under mild curvature assumptions, the paper shows that polynomially small step sizes ensure small sampling errors in total variation distance without requiring smoothness or positivity of data.

Conclusion: The work advances the theoretical foundation for diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces, enabling sharper future analyses.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable empirical success in the recent years and are considered one of the state-of-the-art generative models in modern AI. These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our analysis are Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation. Our approach opens the door to a sharper analysis of diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces.

TL;DR: I-GEM is introduced as a computationally efficient alternative to Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) within the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) subspace, achieving comparable accuracy with significantly reduced overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of LLMs is computationally expensive, prompting the exploration of Continual Learning (CL) methods like GEM with parameter-efficient adapters.

Method: I-GEM leverages LoRA subspace and a fixed-budget, GPU-resident dual projected-gradient approximation to GEM's quadratic projection.

Result: I-GEM matches GEM's accuracy (+/- 0.04 pts) and outperforms A-GEM by ~1.4 pts, while reducing projection time by ~10^3x.

Conclusion: Applying GEM constraints in LoRA subspace offers a practical solution for scalable continual learning in LLMs.

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally costly, motivating Continual Learning (CL) approaches that utilize parameter-efficient adapters. We revisit Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) within the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) subspace and introduce I-GEM: a fixed-budget, GPU-resident dual projected-gradient approximation to GEM's quadratic projection. By constraining non-interference solely within the adapter parameters, I-GEM preserves GEM-like stability with orders-of-magnitude lower mean projection overhead. On a 3-task AG News split with induced domain drift, using GPT-2 (355M) and LoRA ($r=8$), I-GEM matches GEM's average accuracy (within $\sim\!0.04$ pts) and outperforms A-GEM by $\sim\!1.4$ pts. Crucially, it reduces projection time vs.\ GEM by a factor of $\sim\!10^3$. These results suggest that applying GEM constraints in the LoRA subspace is a practical pathway for continual learning at the LLM scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a major update to hdlib, a Python library for Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSA), adding advanced machine learning capabilities like supervised classification, regression, clustering, and graph-based learning, along with Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The update addresses the need for more advanced, data-driven modeling within the VSA framework, building on the foundation of the initial hdlib release.

Method: The authors extend hdlib with four new models: enhanced supervised classification, regression, clustering, and graph-based learning, plus quantum-powered arithmetic and a Quantum Machine Learning model.

Result: The extended library now supports a wider range of machine learning tasks, including quantum computing applications, while remaining open-source and accessible via pip, Conda, and GitHub.

Conclusion: These enhancements significantly broaden hdlib's utility in both traditional and quantum computing contexts, making it a more powerful tool for VSA research and applications.

Abstract: Following the initial publication of hdlib, a Python library for designing Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSA), we introduce a major extension that significantly enhances its machine learning capabilities. VSA, also known as Hyperdimensional Computing, is a computing paradigm that represents and processes information using high-dimensional vectors. While the first version of hdlib established a robust foundation for creating and manipulating these vectors, this update addresses the growing need for more advanced, data-driven modeling within the VSA framework. Here, we present four extensions: significant enhancements to the existing supervised classification model also enabling feature selection, and a new regression model for predicting continuous variables, a clustering model for unsupervised learning, and a graph-based learning model. Furthermore, we propose the first implementation ever of Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing with quantum-powered arithmetic operations and a new Quantum Machine Learning model for supervised learning. hdlib remains open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib under the MIT license, and distributed through the Python Package Index (pip install hdlib) and Conda (conda install -c conda-forge hdlib). Documentation and examples of these new features are available on the official Wiki at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib/wiki.

TL;DR: MixTTE is a scalable framework enhancing travel time estimation by integrating link-level modeling with route-level systems, improving accuracy and stability in large urban networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems for travel time estimation struggle with city-scale traffic dynamics and long-tail scenarios, impacting user experience and operational efficiency.

Method: MixTTE integrates link-level modeling with route-level systems using a spatio-temporal external attention module and a stabilized graph mixture-of-experts network. It employs asynchronous incremental learning for real-time adaptation.

Result: MixTTE reduces prediction errors compared to seven baselines and improves accuracy and stability in real-world deployment at DiDi.

Conclusion: MixTTE effectively addresses limitations of existing TTE systems by capturing global traffic dynamics and adapting to shifting traffic patterns.

Abstract: Accurate Travel Time Estimation (TTE) is critical for ride-hailing platforms, where errors directly impact user experience and operational efficiency. While existing production systems excel at holistic route-level dependency modeling, they struggle to capture city-scale traffic dynamics and long-tail scenarios, leading to unreliable predictions in large urban networks. In this paper, we propose \model, a scalable and adaptive framework that synergistically integrates link-level modeling with industrial route-level TTE systems. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal external attention module to capture global traffic dynamic dependencies across million-scale road networks efficiently. Moreover, we construct a stabilized graph mixture-of-experts network to handle heterogeneous traffic patterns while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, an asynchronous incremental learning strategy is tailored to enable real-time and stable adaptation to dynamic traffic distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world datasets validate MixTTE significantly reduces prediction errors compared to seven baselines. MixTTE has been deployed in DiDi, substantially improving the accuracy and stability of the TTE service.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CBDC, a framework combining statistical learning, topological data analysis, and Bayesian conformal inference to provide reliable uncertainty estimates for dermatological diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of well-calibrated uncertainty estimates in deep learning models for dermatological imaging, which hinders clinical deployment.

Method: CBDC integrates Statistical Learning Theory, Topological Data Analysis, and Bayesian Conformal Inference to ensure theoretical guarantees.

Result: CBDC achieves high classification accuracy and calibrated predictions on HAM10000, PH2, and ISIC 2020 datasets.

Conclusion: CBDC bridges the gap between machine learning theory and clinical applicability in dermatological diagnostics.

Abstract: The rapid growth of dermatological imaging and mobile diagnostic tools calls for systems that not only demonstrate empirical performance but also provide strong theoretical guarantees. Deep learning models have shown high predictive accuracy; however, they are often criticized for lacking well, calibrated uncertainty estimates without which these models are hardly deployable in a clinical setting. To this end, we present the Conformal Bayesian Dermatological Classifier (CBDC), a well, founded framework that combines Statistical Learning Theory, Topological Data Analysis (TDA), and Bayesian Conformal Inference. CBDC offers distribution, dependent generalization bounds that reflect dermatological variability, proves a topological stability theorem that guarantees the invariance of convolutional neural network embeddings under photometric and morphological perturbations and provides finite conformal coverage guarantees for trustworthy uncertainty quantification.
  Through exhaustive experiments on the HAM10000, PH2, and ISIC 2020 datasets, we show that CBDC not only attains classification accuracy but also generates calibrated predictions that are interpretable from a clinical perspective. This research constitutes a theoretical and practical leap for deep dermatological diagnostics, thereby opening the machine learning theory clinical applicability interface.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional credit risk models are costly and fail to leverage raw credit records fully.

Method: LendsNova uses advanced NLP techniques and language models to process raw credit bureau text without manual preprocessing.

Result: Demonstrates strong potential for accurate and efficient risk assessment on real-world data.

Conclusion: LendNova sets a baseline for intelligent credit risk agents and enables future research for automated financial decision-making.

Abstract: Credit risk assessment is essential in the financial sector, but has traditionally depended on costly feature-based models that often fail to utilize all available information in raw credit records. This paper introduces LendNova, the first practical automated end-to-end pipeline for credit risk assessment, designed to utilize all available information in raw credit records by leveraging advanced NLP techniques and language models. LendNova transforms risk modeling by operating directly on raw, jargon-heavy credit bureau text using a language model that learns task-relevant representations without manual feature engineering. By automatically capturing patterns and risk signals embedded in the text, it replaces manual preprocessing steps, reducing costs and improving scalability. Evaluation on real-world data further demonstrates its strong potential in accurate and efficient risk assessment. LendNova establishes a baseline for intelligent credit risk agents, demonstrating the feasibility of language models in this domain. It lays the groundwork for future research toward foundation systems that enable more accurate, adaptable, and automated financial decision-making.

### [154] [Threat Detection in Social Media Networks Using Machine Learning Based Network Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02581)
*Aditi Sanjay Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning-based threat detection framework for social media networks is proposed, using ANN to classify malicious behavior, showing strong performance in detecting threats and improving cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of cyber threats in social media networks and the limitations of traditional rule-based systems necessitate scalable, dynamic solutions.

Method: The approach involves preprocessing and exploratory analysis of network traffic data, followed by training an ANN to detect non-linear patterns of malicious behavior.

Result: The model performs well on standard metrics (accuracy, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC), demonstrating effectiveness in threat detection.

Conclusion: ANN-based solutions can effectively identify cyber threats in social media networks and enhance existing intrusion detection systems.

Abstract: The accelerated development of social media websites has posed intricate security issues in cyberspace, where these sites have increasingly become victims of criminal activities including attempts to intrude into them, abnormal traffic patterns, and organized attacks. The conventional rule-based security systems are not always scalable and dynamic to meet such a threat. This paper introduces a threat detection framework based on machine learning that can be used to classify malicious behavior in the social media network environment based on the nature of network traffic. Exploiting a rich network traffic dataset, the massive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis is conducted to overcome the problem of data imbalance, feature inconsistency, and noise. A model of artificial neural network (ANN) is then created to acquire intricate, non-linear tendencies of malicious actions. The proposed model is tested on conventional performance metrics, such as accuracy, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, and shows good detection and high levels of strength. The findings suggest that neural network-based solutions have the potential to be used effectively to identify the latent threat dynamics within the context of a large-scale social media network and that they can be employed to complement the existing intrusion detection system and better to conduct proactive cybersecurity operations.

### [155] [Chronicals: A High-Performance Framework for LLM Fine-Tuning with 3.51x Speedup over Unsloth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02609)
*Arjun S. Nair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chronicals is a memory-efficient training framework for large language models, achieving 3.51x speedup via fused kernels, memory reduction techniques, optimized LoRA+, and compute recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory constraints bottleneck fine-tuning large language models (e.g., 84GB needed for 7B parameters). Chronicals addresses this by optimizing memory usage and compute efficiency.

Method: Uses four optimizations: (1) fused Triton kernels, (2) Cut Cross-Entropy for memory reduction, (3) LoRA+ with differential learning rates, and (4) Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing.

Result: Achieves 41,184 tokens/second (3.51x speedup) for full fine-tuning and 11,699 tokens/second (4.10x speedup) for LoRA, outperforming Unsloth.

Conclusion: Chronicals significantly improves training efficiency and memory usage, with complete mathematical foundations and open-source availability.

Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning is bottlenecked by memory: a 7B parameter model requires 84GB--14GB for weights, 14GB for gradients, and 56GB for FP32 optimizer states--exceeding even A100-40GB capacity. We present Chronicals, an open-source training framework achieving 3.51x speedup over Unsloth through four synergistic optimizations: (1) fused Triton kernels eliminating 75% of memory traffic via RMSNorm (7x), SwiGLU (5x), and QK-RoPE (2.3x) fusion; (2) Cut Cross-Entropy reducing logit memory from 5GB to 135MB through online softmax computation; (3) LoRA+ with theoretically-derived 16x differential learning rates between adapter matrices; and (4) Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing recovering 60-75% of compute wasted on padding.
  On Qwen2.5-0.5B with A100-40GB, Chronicals achieves 41,184 tokens/second for full fine-tuning versus Unsloth's 11,736 tokens/second (3.51x). For LoRA at rank 32, we reach 11,699 tokens/second versus Unsloth MAX's 2,857 tokens/second (4.10x). Critically, we discovered that Unsloth's reported 46,000 tokens/second benchmark exhibited zero gradient norms--the model was not training.
  We provide complete mathematical foundations: online softmax correctness proofs, FlashAttention IO complexity bounds O(N^2 d^2 M^{-1}), LoRA+ learning rate derivations from gradient magnitude analysis, and bin-packing approximation guarantees. All implementations, benchmarks, and proofs are available at https://github.com/Ajwebdevs/Chronicals with pip installation via https://pypi.org/project/chronicals/.

### [156] [Credit Assignment via Neural Manifold Noise Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02636)
*Byungwoo Kang,Maceo Richards,Bernardo Sabatini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMNC restricts noise perturbations to the neural manifold, improving credit assignment efficiency and performance in networks, aligning with biological observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the poor scalability of noise correlation for credit assignment and its conflict with low-dimensional neural activity manifolds observed in biology.

Method: Proposes neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC) by restricting perturbations to the neural manifold, leveraging alignment between the Jacobian row space and the manifold.

Result: NMNC improves performance and sample efficiency in various networks (convolutional, ImageNet-scale, recurrent) and yields representations closer to primate vision.

Conclusion: NMNC provides a biologically plausible credit assignment mechanism, suggesting biological constraints can enhance scalable learning.

Abstract: Credit assignment--how changes in individual neurons and synapses affect a network's output--is central to learning in brains and machines. Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale.

### [157] [Prioritized Replay for RL Post-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02648)
*Mehdi Fatemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A problem-level prioritization framework for RL post-training of large language models is introduced, using a simple, model-driven priority score derived from success statistics to focus on problems with intermediate success rates for stronger learning signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve RL post-training by prioritizing problems that provide meaningful learning signals, avoiding overly easy or hard tasks, and eliminating the need for manual curriculum design or external labels.

Method: The approach selects problems based on empirical success statistics, using heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting to prevent starvation and forgetting. It requires no predefined difficulty tiers or auxiliary predictors.

Result: The framework provides a continuously adapting, automatic prioritization process that directly aligns data selection with GRPO-based post-training dynamics.

Conclusion: This method offers a scalable and principled alternative to manually designed curricula, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in RL post-training.

Abstract: We introduce a problem-level prioritization framework for RL post-training of large language models. Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training.

### [158] [When Prompting Meets Spiking: Graph Sparse Prompting via Spiking Graph Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02662)
*Bo Jiang,Weijun Zhao,Beibei Wang,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SpikingGPF, a method for learning sparse graph prompts using spiking neurons to improve robustness and reduce redundancy in feature dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) methods prompt all node feature dimensions, causing redundancy and sensitivity to noise. SpikingGPF addresses this by leveraging spiking neurons for sparse prompting.

Method: SpikingGPF uses a spiking neuron architecture to learn sparse prompt vectors for selective node features and introduces a sparse representation model based on prompt atoms.

Result: Experiments show SpikingGPF is effective and robust, offering compact and lightweight prompting.

Conclusion: SpikingGPF improves upon traditional GPF methods by reducing redundancy and noise sensitivity through spiking neuron-based sparse prompting.

Abstract: Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) learning has been widely used in adapting pre-trained GNN model on the downstream task. GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.

*Xiaoyan Sun,Qingyu Meng,Yalu Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAFS introduces a hybrid framework combining statistical priors with multi-head attention for scalable, interpretable, and robust feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature selection methods struggle to balance scalability, interpretability, and capturing complex relationships in high-dimensional biomedical data.

Method: MAFS integrates filter-based priors for stable initialization, multi-head attention for parallel feature examination, and a reordering module for robust rankings.

Result: MAFS outperforms existing methods in coverage and stability across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data.

Conclusion: MAFS offers a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection, combining statistical guidance with deep learning capabilities.

Abstract: Feature selection is essential for high-dimensional biomedical data, enabling stronger predictive performance, reduced computational cost, and improved interpretability in precision medicine applications. Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.

Conclusion: Uni-FinLLM demonstrates that a unified multimodal LLM can effectively model financial risks, providing scalable decision support.

Abstract: Financial institutions and regulators require systems that integrate heterogeneous data to assess risks from stock fluctuations to systemic vulnerabilities. Existing approaches often treat these tasks in isolation, failing to capture cross-scale dependencies. We propose Uni-FinLLM, a unified multimodal large language model that uses a shared Transformer backbone and modular task heads to jointly process financial text, numerical time series, fundamentals, and visual data. Through cross-modal attention and multi-task optimization, it learns a coherent representation for micro-, meso-, and macro-level predictions.

It raises stock directional accuracy to 67.4% (from 61.7%), credit-risk accuracy to 84.1% (from 79.6%), and macro early-warning accuracy to 82.3%. Results validate that a unified multimodal LLM can jointly model asset behavior and systemic vulnerabilities, offering a scalable decision-support engine for finance.

### [161] [Topology-Independent Robustness of the Weighted Mean under Label Poisoning Attacks in Heterogeneous Decentralized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02682)
*Jie Peng,Weiyu Li,Stefan Vlaski,Qing Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized gradient descent's robustness to label poisoning attacks is analyzed, comparing weighted mean and robust aggregators. Weighted mean can outperform in certain heterogeneous conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of decentralized systems against label poisoning attacks, focusing on the roles of aggregators and network topology.

Method: Analysis of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning, comparing weighted mean and robust aggregators with theoretical and empirical validation.

Result: Weighted mean aggregators can outperform robust ones under specific conditions, highlighting topology's role in robustness.

Conclusion: Network topology significantly impacts robustness, and weighted mean aggregators may be preferable in certain heterogeneous scenarios.

Abstract: Robustness to malicious attacks is crucial for practical decentralized signal processing and machine learning systems. A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks.

*Xinyi Liu,Xuan He,Yize Chen*

TL;DR: This paper conducts a systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF, revealing power-law relationships between data/compute scales and performance metrics, enabling principled ML pipeline design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of quantified scaling relationships in ML-based OPF solutions, which currently rely on trial-and-error methods, by providing systematic insights.

Method: The authors analyze scaling laws across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (varying NN architectures), focusing on prediction error, constraint violations, and speed.

Result: Power-law relationships between resource dimensions (data/compute) and performance metrics are identified, revealing predictable scaling trends for ML-OPF pipelines.

Conclusion: The study provides quantitative guidance for designing and deploying ML-based OPF solutions, highlighting the trade-offs between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility.

Abstract: Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the fundamental tasks for power system operations. While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rotary positional embedding in transformers can be simplified with complex linear transformations, saving 50% parameters without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current implementations of rotary positional embedding are not equivalent to complex linear transformations, which could be more natural and parameter-efficient.

Method: Propose replacing the standard $Q/K/V$-projections with complex linear transformations.

Result: Saves nearly 50% parameters with negligible impact on model performance.

Conclusion: The modification improves parameter efficiency and offers a cleaner representation space interpretation.

Abstract: Rotary positional embedding has become the state-of-the-art approach to encode position information in transformer-based models. While it is often succinctly expressed in complex linear algebra, we note that the actual implementation of $Q/K/V$-projections is not equivalent to a complex linear transformation. We argue that complex linear transformation is a more natural parametrization and saves near 50\% parameters within the attention block. We show empirically that removing such redundancy has negligible impact on the model performance both in sample and out of sample. Our modification achieves more efficient parameter usage, as well as a cleaner interpretation of the representation space.

TL;DR: A scalable framework for computing tree ensemble proximities efficiently using sparse linear algebra, avoiding quadratic complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proximity measures from tree ensembles suffer from high computational and memory costs, limiting scalability.

Method: Introduces Separable Weighted Leaf-Collision Proximities, enabling exact sparse matrix factorization to compute proximities efficiently.

Result: Achieves significant runtime and memory improvements, scaling to large datasets (hundreds of thousands of samples).

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable solution for proximity computation in tree ensembles using sparse linear algebra.

Abstract: Tree ensemble methods such as Random Forests naturally induce supervised similarity measures through their decision tree structure, but existing implementations of proximities derived from tree ensembles typically suffer from quadratic time or memory complexity, limiting their scalability. In this work, we introduce a general framework for efficient proximity computation by defining a family of Separable Weighted Leaf-Collision Proximities. We show that any proximity measure in this family admits an exact sparse matrix factorization, restricting computation to leaf-level collisions and avoiding explicit pairwise comparisons. This formulation enables low-memory, scalable proximity computation using sparse linear algebra in Python. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate substantial runtime and memory improvements over traditional approaches, allowing tree ensemble proximities to scale efficiently to datasets with hundreds of thousands of samples on standard CPU hardware.

TL;DR: QGA introduces a Q-value regularized generative auto-bidding method combining RL and generative models to optimize ad performance by leveraging historical data and improving policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current auto-bidding methods rely on complex RL and generative models, suffering from suboptimal trajectories and expensive tuning, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: QGA integrates Q-value regularization with double Q-learning into Decision Transformer, optimizing policy imitation and action-value maximization. It includes a dual-exploration mechanism guided by Q-values.

Result: QGA outperforms alternatives in benchmarks and real-world A/B tests, achieving significant improvements in Ad GMV (3.27%) and Ad ROI (2.49%).

Conclusion: QGA effectively addresses challenges in auto-bidding, offering a robust and efficient solution for optimizing advertising performance.

Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.
  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.

TL;DR: RadioDiff-Flux is a two-stage latent diffusion framework for fast and accurate radio map construction in 6G networks, reducing inference time by reusing precomputed midpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future 6G networks demand real-time radio map construction due to high-speed and dynamic environments, but existing methods face latency issues.

Method: RadioDiff-Flux decouples static modeling from dynamic refinement, reusing precomputed midpoints to avoid redundant denoising steps.

Result: Achieves up to 50× acceleration with minimal accuracy loss (<0.15%), enabling scalable RM generation.

Conclusion: RadioDiff-Flux is efficient and practical for real-time RM construction in dynamic 6G scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate radio map (RM) construction is essential to enabling environment-aware and adaptive wireless communication. However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks.

Motivation: Accurate day-ahead forecasts for electricity prices are essential for portfolio management, power plant operations, battery storage, and demand response planning, but existing models struggle with volatility and computational inefficiency.

Method: The proposed method uses a multivariate neural network combining linear and nonlinear feed-forward structures, incorporating online learning, forecast combination, and factors like wind/solar generation, demand patterns, fuel/carbon markets, autoregressive dynamics, and calendar effects.

Result: The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, reducing RMSE by 12-13% and MAE by 15-18%, with lower computational costs, as validated in a six-year study across major European markets.

Conclusion: The hybrid neural network approach offers a balanced solution for accurate and efficient electricity price forecasting by integrating key features and leveraging both linear and nonlinear relationships.

Abstract: Precise day-ahead forecasts for electricity prices are crucial to ensure efficient portfolio management, support strategic decision-making for power plant operations, enable efficient battery storage optimization, and facilitate demand response planning. However, developing an accurate prediction model is highly challenging in an uncertain and volatile market environment. For instance, although linear models generally exhibit competitive performance in predicting electricity prices with minimal computational requirements, they fail to capture relevant nonlinear relationships. Nonlinear models, on the other hand, can improve forecasting accuracy with a surge in computational costs. We propose a novel multivariate neural network approach that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures. Unlike previous hybrid models, our approach integrates online learning and forecast combination for efficient training and accuracy improvement. It also incorporates all relevant characteristics, particularly the fundamental relationships arising from wind and solar generation, electricity demand patterns, related energy fuel and carbon markets, in addition to autoregressive dynamics and calendar effects. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark models, the proposed forecasting method significantly reduces computational cost while delivering superior forecasting accuracy (12-13% RMSE and 15-18% MAE reductions). Our results are derived from a six-year forecasting study conducted on major European electricity markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges faced by neural network-based algorithms in scaling to quantum neural networks (QNNs), such as over-parameterization and computational instability.

Method: The QNTK-UCB algorithm freezes QNN at random initialization, uses static QNTK for ridge regression, avoiding unstable training dynamics while leveraging quantum inductive bias.

Result: Achieves improved parameter scaling (Ω((TK)^3)) compared to classical NeuralUCB (Ω((TK)^8)) and demonstrates superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes.

Conclusion: QNTK's properties enable implicit regularization and sharper spectral decay, potentially leading to quantum advantage in online learning.

Abstract: Stochastic contextual bandits are fundamental for sequential decision-making but pose significant challenges for existing neural network-based algorithms, particularly when scaling to quantum neural networks (QNNs) due to issues such as massive over-parameterization, computational instability, and the barren plateau phenomenon. This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.
  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $Ω((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $Ω((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning.

TL;DR: The paper compares domain generalization techniques (ADG, IRM, and baseline models) for predicting Stick-Slip Index (SSI) in drilling. Results show ADG and IRM outperform the baseline, with ADG slightly better. Transfer learning further boosts performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust regression model for SSI prediction that generalizes across drilling domains using domain generalization techniques.

Method: Train models on 60-second labeled sequences of 1 Hz drilling data, test on unseen wells, optimize hyperparameters via grid search, and compare ADG, IRM, and baseline models.

Result: ADG and IRM models improve performance by 10% and 8% over baseline, respectively. Severe events detected 60% vs. 20% baseline. TL further enhances results.

Conclusion: Domain generalization techniques are effective for drilling applications, with ADG performing slightly better than IRM. Transfer learning adds further performance gains.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of domain generalization techniques applied to time series data within a drilling context, focusing on the prediction of a continuous Stick-Slip Index (SSI), a critical metric for assessing torsional downhole vibrations at the drill bit. The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on 60 second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model. Additionally, applying TL to a pre-trained model further improves performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of domain generalization approaches in drilling applications, with ADG emerging as the most effective approach.

TL;DR: RPIQ is a novel quantization framework designed to compress large-scale models for assistive devices, reducing memory usage by 60%-75% while maintaining performance close to full precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by visually impaired users in accessing information and perceiving environments, and to overcome the limitations of deploying large-scale models due to high memory and inference costs.

Method: Proposes RPIQ, a multi-collaborative closed-loop quantization scheme with Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization.

Result: Compresses models to 4-bit representation, reduces peak memory consumption significantly, and maintains performance close to full precision in language and visual tasks.

Conclusion: RPIQ effectively enables large models to be deployed in assistive systems, improving computational efficiency and reliability for visually impaired users.

Abstract: Visually impaired users face significant challenges in daily information access and real-time environmental perception, and there is an urgent need for intelligent assistive systems with accurate recognition capabilities. Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios. While verifying the effectiveness of RPIQ for deployment in real assistive systems, this study also advances the computational efficiency and reliability of large models, enabling them to provide visually impaired users with the required information accurately and rapidly.

### [171] [Bridging Mechanistic Interpretability and Prompt Engineering with Gradient Ascent for Interpretable Persona Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02896)
*Harshvardhan Saini,Yiming Tang,Dianbo Liu*

TL;DR: The paper introduces RESGA and SAEGA, novel methods for optimizing prompts in LLMs to control behavioral personas like sycophancy and hallucination, achieving significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of controlling behavioral personas in LLMs, given the limitations of existing methods like manual prompt engineering and black-box optimization.

Method: Proposes RESGA and SAEGA, gradient ascent-based methods for targeted prompt discovery, with fluent gradient ascent to ensure prompt fluency.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness across multiple LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Gemma 3) for steering personas, with a notable 49.90% to 79.24% improvement on sycophancy.

Conclusion: The framework provides a controllable and interpretable approach for behavior modification in LLMs, grounded in mechanistic features.

Abstract: Controlling emergent behavioral personas (e.g., sycophancy, hallucination) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI safety, yet remains a persistent challenge. Existing solutions face a dilemma: manual prompt engineering is intuitive but unscalable and imprecise, while automatic optimization methods are effective but operate as "black boxes" with no interpretable connection to model internals. We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery. In specific, we propose two methods, RESGA and SAEGA, that both optimize randomly initialized prompts to achieve better aligned representation with an identified persona direction. We introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts. We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three different personas,sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward. Crucially, on sycophancy, our automatically discovered prompts achieve significant improvement (49.90% compared with 79.24%). By grounding prompt discovery in mechanistically meaningful features, our method offers a new paradigm for controllable and interpretable behavior modification.

*Waleed Khalid,Dmitry Ignatov,Radu Timofte*

TL;DR: This paper explores using a code-oriented LLM in a closed-loop synthesis framework to autonomously design neural architectures, improving performance and novelty over fine-tuning cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLMs' ability in neural architecture design by balancing syntactic reliability, performance, and novelty, leveraging execution feedback for iterative improvement.

Method: Places a code-oriented LLM in a closed-loop synthesis framework with supervised fine-tuning cycles, validating synthesized PyTorch networks using performance signals and filtering redundancy. High-performing architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for LoRA adaptation.

Result: The LLM improves generation validity (stabilizing at 50.6%, peaking at 74.5%), accuracy (from 28.06% to 50.99%), and high-performing candidates (from 2.04% to 96.81%), synthesizing 455 novel architectures.

Conclusion: LLMs can internalize empirical rewards to transcend training data, offering a scalable blueprint for autonomous neural designers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in program synthesis, yet their ability to autonomously navigate neural architecture design--balancing syntactic reliability, performance, and structural novelty--remains underexplored. We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus. By grounding code synthesis in execution feedback, this work provides a scalable blueprint for transforming stochastic generators into autonomous, performance-driven neural designers, establishing that LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to transcend their training data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In many fairness and distribution robustness problems, one has access to labeled data from multiple source distributions yet the test data may come from an arbitrary member or a mixture of them. We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPICE is a Bayesian in-context reinforcement learning method that adapts quickly to unseen tasks using deep ensemble priors and Bayesian updates, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-context reinforcement learning methods struggle with adaptation beyond training data or require optimal data, limiting practicality.

Method: SPICE uses a deep ensemble to learn priors over Q-values and updates them via Bayesian updates during inference, with an Upper-Confidence Bound rule for exploration.

Result: SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions, reduces regret, and rapidly adapts to unseen tasks, even with suboptimal training data.

Conclusion: SPICE demonstrates robust performance and adaptability in unseen environments, outperforming existing ICRL and meta-RL approaches.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) promises fast adaptation to unseen environments without parameter updates, but current methods either cannot improve beyond the training distribution or require near-optimal data, limiting practical adoption. We introduce SPICE, a Bayesian ICRL method that learns a prior over Q-values via deep ensemble and updates this prior at test-time using in-context information through Bayesian updates. To recover from poor priors resulting from training on sub-optimal data, our online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule that favours exploration and adaptation. We prove that SPICE achieves regret-optimal behaviour in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained only on suboptimal trajectories. We validate these findings empirically across bandit and control benchmarks. SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior ICRL and meta-RL approaches while rapidly adapting to unseen tasks and remaining robust under distribution shift.

*Vidhi Rathore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMF bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning to ensure fairness by maintaining invariant latent space geometry under interventions on sensitive attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fairness approaches ignore generative data structures. CMF addresses the causal impact of sensitive attributes on data manifold geometry.

Method: CMF learns a latent representation where local Riemannian geometry (metric tensor, curvature) is invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes, enforcing constraints on the decoder's Jacobian and Hessian.

Result: Validated on synthetic SCMs, CMF disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, providing a rigorous fairness-utility trade-off measure.

Conclusion: CMF offers a novel geometric approach to fairness, ensuring invariant latent space rules across demographic groups.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is increasingly critical, yet standard approaches often treat data as static points in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying generative structure. We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.

TL;DR: Anthropic's mechanistic interpretability approach extracts human-interpretable features from LLMs using SAEs, but replication reveals fragility and limitations, highlighting unresolved AI safety challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test Anthropic's claims about understanding and controlling LLMs via SAEs, aiming to assess its reliability for AI safety.

Method: Replicated Anthropic's results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1, testing feature extraction, steering, and fragility factors.

Result: Feature steering is fragile, sensitive to layer/context, and struggles to distinguish similar features; SAEs lack systematic reliability.

Conclusion: Focus should shift from interpretability to reliable output control; mechanistic interpretability's current limitations pose unresolved AI safety challenges.

Abstract: Recent work by Anthropic on Mechanistic interpretability claims to understand and control Large Language Models by extracting human-interpretable features from their neural activation patterns using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). If successful, this approach offers one of the most promising routes for human oversight in AI safety. We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output. Our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of what mechanistic interpretability has achieved and highlights fundamental challenges for AI safety that remain unresolved.

TL;DR: Proposes joint encoding of KV-cache blocks to compress memory-heavy LLM caches, achieving high compression and throughput without specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the bottleneck of KV-cache memory growth in LLMs, which limits real-time throughput under concurrent loads.

Method: Joint encoding fuses similar KV-cache blocks across requests and input chunks while preserving standard cache structure.

Result: Achieves up to 4.38× KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss and ∼40% higher token throughput in real LLM serving.

Conclusion: Demonstrates scalable and hardware-agnostic KV-cache compression, improving LLM inference throughput.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) drive interactive AI systems but are bottlenecked by the memory-heavy growth of key-value (KV) caches, which limits real-time throughput under concurrent loads. Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment.
  We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\sim$40\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive anomaly detection method for IIoT streaming data using a multi-source prediction model and concept drift adaptation, achieving high accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-generation networks require reliable anomaly detection for multi-dimensional IIoT data, but existing methods struggle with complexity and dynamism.

Method: Combines a prediction model with a novel drift adaptation method.

Result: Achieves 89.71% accuracy (AUC) and meets efficiency/scalability requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for IIoT anomaly detection.

Abstract: To ensure reliability and service availability, next-generation networks are expected to rely on automated anomaly detection systems powered by advanced machine learning methods with the capability of handling multi-dimensional data. Such multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data occurs mostly in today's industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where real-time detection of anomalies is critical to prevent impending failures and resolve them in a timely manner. However, existing anomaly detection methods often fall short of effectively coping with the complexity and dynamism of multi-dimensional data streams in IIoT. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for detecting anomalies in IIoT streaming data utilizing a multi-source prediction model and concept drift adaptation. The proposed anomaly detection algorithm merges a prediction model into a novel drift adaptation method resulting in accurate and efficient anomaly detection that exhibits improved scalability. Our trace-driven evaluations indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods by achieving up to an 89.71% accuracy (in terms of Area under the Curve (AUC)) while meeting the given efficiency and scalability requirements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAFA, a query-efficient auditing tool for black-box LLMs, uses active sampling to reduce resource needs while estimating fairness metrics accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing systematic biases in LLMs requires efficient auditing methods due to resource constraints in traditional approaches.

Method: BAFA employs uncertainty estimation via constrained empirical risk minimisation and active query selection to narrow fairness metric intervals.

Result: BAFA achieved target error thresholds with up to 40x fewer queries than stratified sampling, showing consistent performance across datasets.

Conclusion: Active sampling significantly reduces resource requirements for fairness auditing, enabling continuous model evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic biases across demographic groups. Auditing is proposed as an accountability tool for black-box LLM applications, but suffers from resource-intensive query access. We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $Δ$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \textsc{CivilComments} and \textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\varepsilon=0.02$ for \textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs. These results suggest that active sampling can reduce resources needed for independent fairness auditing with LLMs, supporting continuous model evaluations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATLAS introduces adaptive latent steering for LLMs, dynamically adjusting intervention strength using a lightweight verifier, improving reasoning accuracy while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent steering methods use fixed policies, leading to inconsistent performance and inefficiency. ATLAS aims to address this by enabling dynamic, per-example adjustments.

Method: ATLAS employs an external latent verifier to predict reasoning quality and adaptively control steering decisions during inference, minimizing overhead.

Result: ATLAS outperforms vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines on math reasoning benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy and reduced token usage.

Conclusion: ATLAS demonstrates that verifier-guided adaptive steering enhances LLM reasoning efficiency and quality effectively and scalably.

Abstract: Recent work on activation and latent steering has demonstrated that modifying internal representations can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) toward improved reasoning and efficiency without additional training. However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task- specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality. All source code will be publicly available.

*Meghna Roy Chowdhury,Shreyas Sen,Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MyoText is a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals into text via finger activations and ergonomic typing priors, achieving high accuracy and low error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve sEMG-to-text decoding by introducing physiologically grounded intermediate stages, enhancing wearable and mixed-reality typing interfaces.

Method: MyoText uses CNN-BiLSTM-Attention for finger classification, ergonomic typing priors for letter inference, and a T5 transformer for sentence reconstruction.

Result: Achieves 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER) on 30 users.

Conclusion: MyoText demonstrates a viable pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, advancing wearable neural input for future computing environments.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a direct neural interface for decoding muscle activity and offers a promising foundation for keyboard-free text input in wearable and mixed-reality systems. Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), a method for causal inference in time-series panel data that leverages temporal structure using a state-space model and Kalman filtering, showing improved performance in noisy and trend-heavy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic control methods often ignore temporal ordering, limiting their effectiveness in data with strong trends. The authors aim to address this gap.

Method: TASC uses a state-space model with a constant trend and low-rank signal structure, applying Kalman filtering and smoothing for model fitting and counterfactual inference.

Result: TASC outperforms existing methods in simulated and real-world datasets, particularly in noisy environments with strong temporal trends.

Conclusion: TASC enhances causal inference accuracy by explicitly modeling temporal structure, making it suitable for trend-heavy and noisy observational data.

Abstract: The synthetic control (SC) framework is widely used for observational causal inference with time-series panel data. SC has been successful in diverse applications, but existing methods typically treat the ordering of pre-intervention time indices interchangeable. This invariance means they may not fully take advantage of temporal structure when strong trends are present. We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference. We evaluate TASC on both simulated and real-world datasets, including policy evaluation and sports prediction. Our results suggest that TASC offers advantages in settings with strong temporal trends and high levels of observation noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that one-shot learning with reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), challenging the need for large datasets by focusing on sample quality and design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to challenge the conventional belief that RL for LLMs requires extensive high-quality samples. They explore whether a single, well-designed training sample can unlock multidisciplinary reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Method: They introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that integrates elements from multiple disciplines. This includes selecting strategic math reasoning samples and engineering synthetic samples that combine multidiscipline elements.

Result: The approach shows significant performance improvements across domains like physics, chemistry, and biology using just one sample. Engineered synthetic samples outperform naturally occurring individual samples, and the method surpasses training with larger datasets on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study suggests that sample quality and design are more critical than quantity for enhancing reasoning in LLMs. It advocates for a shift toward 'sample engineering'—precision crafting of training samples—instead of merely increasing data volume.

Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) can be unleashed with reinforcement learning (RL) (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a; Zeng et al., 2025). The success of existing RL attempts in LLMs usually relies on high-quality samples of thousands or beyond. In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models. Our results suggest a shift, dubbed as sample engineering, toward precision engineering of training samples rather than simply increasing data volume.

TL;DR: PersonaLedger is a synthetic financial data generator using LLMs and a rule engine to create diverse, logically grounded transaction data, addressing privacy and research limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strict privacy regulations hinder access to real financial transaction data, slowing AI research. Existing synthetic data methods lack behavioral diversity or violate financial constraints.

Method: Combines a large language model (LLM) conditioned on user personas with a rule engine to generate transactions. The LLM produces actions, and the engine enforces rules and updates states.

Result: Generated a public dataset of 30M transactions from 23K users and benchmark tasks for illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation.

Conclusion: PersonaLedger provides a realistic, privacy-preserving dataset and tools to advance financial AI research with reproducible evaluations.

Abstract: Strict privacy regulations limit access to real transaction data, slowing open research in financial AI. Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware "nextprompt" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models. PersonaLedger offers the community a rich, realistic, and privacy preserving resource -- complete with code, rules, and generation logs -- to accelerate innovation in financial AI and enable rigorous, reproducible evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs) to understand how prompts cause specific outputs (e.g., toxicity, bias) in generative AI, adapting counterfactual methods for non-deterministic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations need to interpret generative AI behavior, especially understanding how prompts lead to specific output characteristics like toxicity or bias.

Method: Proposes a framework adapting counterfactual explanations for generative AI and introduces an algorithm for PCEs, demonstrated with case studies on political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment.

Result: PCEs streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable outputs and enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover problematic prompts.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI, crucial for high-stakes tasks and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior. In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.

*Wadie Skaf,Felix Kern,Aryamaan Basu Roy,Tejas Pradhan,Roman Kalkreuth,Holger Hoos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RATS is a high-performance Rust library for time series augmentation, offering significant speed and memory improvements over Python-based alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance bottlenecks in existing Python-based time series augmentation libraries, which limit scalability.

Method: Develop RATS in Rust with Python bindings (RATSpy), implementing various augmentation methods and parallelization.

Result: RATSpy achieves a 74.5% average speedup and up to 47.9% less memory usage compared to tasug.

Conclusion: RATS provides a scalable and efficient solution for time series augmentation in large-scale systems.

Abstract: Time series augmentation is critical for training robust deep learning models, particularly in domains where labelled data is scarce and expensive to obtain. However, existing augmentation libraries for time series, mainly written in Python, suffer from performance bottlenecks, where running time grows exponentially as dataset sizes increase -- an aspect limiting their applicability in large-scale, production-grade systems. We introduce RATS (Rapid Augmentations for Time Series), a high-performance library for time series augmentation written in Rust with Python bindings (RATSpy). RATS implements multiple augmentation methods spanning basic transformations, frequency-domain operations and time warping techniques, all accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelisation. Comprehensive benchmarking of RATSpy versus a commonly used library (tasug) on 143 datasets demonstrates that RATSpy achieves an average speedup of 74.5\% over tsaug (up to 94.8\% on large datasets), with up to 47.9\% less peak memory usage.

*Shuai Jiang,Alexey Voronin,Eric Cyr,Ben Southworth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PGD mitigates spectral bias and reduces grokking delays by enabling uniform parameter exploration in the NTK regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how preconditioned gradient descent affects spectral bias and grokking dynamics in neural networks.

Method: Utilizes theoretical analysis and empirical experiments with PGD (e.g., Gauss-Newton) to study spectral bias and grokking.

Result: PGD alleviates spectral bias and reduces grokking delays, supporting the transitional behavior hypothesis between NTK and rich regimes.

Conclusion: PGD improves learning dynamics by addressing spectral bias and grokking, advancing understanding of neural network optimization phases.

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low frequencies first, can be both a blessing and a curse. While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime. These findings deepen our understanding of the interplay between optimization dynamics, spectral bias, and the phases of neural network learning.

### [188] [Dynamic Hyperparameter Importance for Efficient Multi-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03166)
*Daphne Theodorakopoulos,Marcel Wever,Marius Lindauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic optimization approach for ML model selection, prioritizing influential hyperparameters based on objective trade-offs to improve convergence speed and Pareto front quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MOO methods treat all hyperparameters equally, ignoring their varying importance based on objective trade-offs, leading to suboptimal solutions.

Method: Proposes integrating HyperSHAP-calculated HPI into MOO, adapting the configuration space by fixing less important hyperparameters and focusing on influential ones using ParEGO.

Result: Empirical validation shows faster convergence and better Pareto front quality across diverse tasks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic prioritization of hyperparameters based on HPI enhances MOO efficiency and solution quality in ML model selection.

Abstract: Choosing a suitable ML model is a complex task that can depend on several objectives, e.g., accuracy, model size, fairness, inference time, or energy consumption. In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones. Eventually, we validate our method with diverse tasks from PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baselines.

*Sumit S. Shevtekar,Chandresh K. Maurya,Gourab Sil,Subasish Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale dataset to study time pressure's impact on powered two-wheeler riders, proposing MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model for accurate time pressure prediction and collision risk mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time pressure affects risky riding behaviors but is underexplored in intelligent transportation systems. This work aims to predict and mitigate its effects proactively.

Method: The study analyzes 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences under varying time pressure conditions. It proposes MotoTimePressure, combining convolutional preprocessing, temporal attention, and feature recalibration.

Result: High Time Pressure leads to 48% higher speeds and other risky behaviors. MotoTimePressure achieves 91.53% accuracy and improves collision risk prediction accuracy by 2.26%.

Conclusion: Time pressure prediction enables proactive safety interventions like adaptive alerts and speed guidance, enhancing rider safety under the Safe System Approach.

Abstract: Time pressure critically influences risky maneuvers and crash proneness among powered two-wheeler riders, yet its prediction remains underexplored in intelligent transportation systems. We present a large-scale dataset of 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides by 51 participants under No, Low, and High Time Pressure conditions. Each sequence captures 63 features spanning vehicle kinematics, control inputs, behavioral violations, and environmental context. Our empirical analysis shows High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns at intersections, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces versus No Time Pressure. To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%). Thresholded time pressure states capture rider cognitive stress and enable proactive ITS interventions, including adaptive alerts, haptic feedback, V2I signaling, and speed guidance, supporting safer two-wheeler mobility under the Safe System Approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the theoretical foundations and practical implications of decentralization in autoregressive generation, particularly for multimodal language models.

Method: Defines Decentralized Discrete Flow Matching objective using expert flows and compares decentralized vs. centralized training with benchmarks like LLaVA and InternVL 2.5-1B.

Result: Demonstrates equivalence between decentralized and centralized training settings for multimodal models, with experiments on diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Decentralized approaches can achieve comparable performance to centralized methods in autoregressive generation, as validated by experiments.

Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of decentralization of autoregressive generation. We define the Decentralized Discrete Flow Matching objective, by expressing probability generating velocity as a linear combination of expert flows. We also conduct experiments demonstrat- ing the equivalence between decentralized and centralized training settings for multimodal language models across diverse set of benchmarks. Specifically, we compare two distinct paradigms: LLaVA and InternVL 2.5-1B, which uses a fixed CLIP vision encoder and per- forms full-parameter fine-tuning (ViT+MLP+LLM) during the instruction tuning stage.

### [191] [Sparse Knowledge Distillation: A Mathematical Framework for Probability-Domain Temperature Scaling and Multi-Stage Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03195)
*Aaron R. Flouro,Shawn P. Chadwick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical framework for sparse knowledge distillation using probability-domain softening operators, offering insights into when sparse students outperform dense teachers, multi-stage pruning, convergence guarantees, and equivalence class characterizations. It introduces axioms for softening operators and shows their uniform applicability across scenarios like black-box distillation and privacy-preserving compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified theoretical foundation for sparse knowledge distillation, particularly focusing on probability-domain softening operators and their implications for model compression and distillation scenarios.

Method: The framework includes bias-variance decompositions, homotopy path formalization for pruning, convergence guarantees, and equivalence class characterizations. It also axiomatizes probability-domain softening operators based on key properties.

Result: Theoretical guarantees are proven, including $O(1/n)$ convergence rates and uniform applicability across operator families, supporting scenarios like black-box distillation and privacy-preserving compression.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust theoretical grounding for sparse knowledge distillation, offering practical insights for model compression, teacher distillation, and scenarios with partial access or privacy constraints.

Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for sparse knowledge distillation based on probability-domain softening operators. While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \propto \mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.
  The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints.
  We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression.

*Weilei He,Feng Ju,Zhiyuan Fan,Rui Min,Minhao Cheng,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VC-IFEval, a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to follow instructions involving both visual and textual inputs, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs focus mainly on textual instructions, neglecting visual constraints. This limits thorough evaluation of instruction-following capabilities in multimodal settings.

Method: The authors develop VC-IFEval, a benchmark with a dataset incorporating vision-dependent constraints into instruction design. They also fine-tune MLLMs on this dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning MLLMs on VC-IFEval leads to significant improvements in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence. Evaluation reveals strengths and limitations of current models.

Conclusion: VC-IFEval provides a rigorous framework for assessing MLLMs' instruction-following abilities in multimodal contexts, offering insights for future model improvements.

Abstract: Evaluating the instruction-following (IF) capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for rigorously assessing how faithfully model outputs adhere to user-specified intentions. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis of instruction-following capabilities, as they overlook the implicit constraints embedded in the semantically rich visual modality. To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning MLLMs on our dataset, we achieve substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence. Through extensive evaluation across representative MLLMs, we provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of current models.

### [193] [Counterfactual Fairness with Graph Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03203)
*Davi Valério,Chrysoula Zerva,Mariana Pinto,Ricardo Santos,André Carreiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CF-GU, a method to incorporate uncertainty in causal graphs into Counterfactual Fairness audits for ML model bias evaluation, validated on synthetic and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CF audits rely on a single causal graph, which is often uncertain in real-world scenarios, necessitating a method to account for this uncertainty.

Method: CF-GU bootstraps causal discovery under domain constraints to generate plausible DAGs, quantifies graph uncertainty with Shannon entropy, and provides confidence bounds on CF metrics.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets (COMPAS and Adult) validated CF-GU's ability to identify biases confidently, even with minimal domain knowledge.

Conclusion: CF-GU enhances CF audits by addressing causal graph uncertainty, improving trustworthiness and robustness in ML bias evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating machine learning (ML) model bias is key to building trustworthy and robust ML systems. Counterfactual Fairness (CF) audits allow the measurement of bias of ML models with a causal framework, yet their conclusions rely on a single causal graph that is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios. We propose CF with Graph Uncertainty (CF-GU), a bias evaluation procedure that incorporates the uncertainty of specifying a causal graph into CF. CF-GU (i) bootstraps a Causal Discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to produce a bag of plausible Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), (ii) quantifies graph uncertainty with the normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) provides confidence bounds on CF metrics. Experiments on synthetic data show how contrasting domain knowledge assumptions support or refute audits of CF, while experiments on real-world data (COMPAS and Adult datasets) pinpoint well-known biases with high confidence, even when supplied with minimal domain knowledge constraints.

*Mykola Vysotskyi,Zahar Kohut,Mariia Shpir,Taras Rumezhak,Volodymyr Karpiv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel RL framework for machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models improves concept removal while preserving utility, using per-step rewards and timestep-aware critics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high-variance updates and weak credit assignment in existing RL methods for diffusion unlearning, and to enable better concept removal without sacrificing image quality.

Method: Introduces a sequential decision process for denoising, with a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and per-step rewards for policy-gradient updates.

Result: Achieves better or comparable forgetting to baselines while maintaining image quality and prompt fidelity; highlights the importance of per-step critics and noisy-conditioned rewards.

Conclusion: The proposed RL framework is effective, simple to implement, and supports reproducibility, offering a robust solution for diffusion unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models aims to remove targeted concepts while preserving overall utility. Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness. We release code and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducibility and future research on RL-based diffusion unlearning.

*Marc Finzi,Shikai Qiu,Yiding Jiang,Pavel Izmailov,J. Zico Kolter,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'epiplexity,' a new measure of information that captures what computationally bounded observers can learn from data, challenging traditional information theory assumptions and demonstrating how information can be created, structured, and leveraged.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity, which assume unlimited computational capacity and fail to target useful information content.

Method: The authors introduce 'epiplexity,' a formalization of information that excludes time-bounded entropy and captures structural content. They provide practical procedures to estimate epiplexity.

Result: Epiplexity demonstrates how information can be created computationally, depends on data ordering, and shows how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than the data-generating process.

Conclusion: Epiplexity offers a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to choose, generate, or transform data for learning systems.

Abstract: Can we learn more from data than existed in the generating process itself? Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PET-TURTLE improves TURTLE by handling imbalanced data with a power law prior and sparse logits, enhancing clustering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TURTLE's assumption of balanced clusters leads to errors with imbalanced data. PET-TURTLE addresses this limitation.

Method: PET-TURTLE modifies TURTLE's cost function using a power law prior and introduces sparse logits for simpler optimization.

Result: PET-TURTLE improves accuracy for imbalanced data, avoids over-predicting minority clusters, and enhances overall clustering.

Conclusion: PET-TURTLE outperforms TURTLE, especially with imbalanced data, while maintaining or improving performance on balanced datasets.

Abstract: Foundation vision, audio, and language models enable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks via their latent representations. Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that PET-TURTLE improves accuracy for imbalanced sources, prevents over-prediction of minority clusters, and enhances overall clustering.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) framework that generates and refines textual explanations, converts them into transparent rules, and evaluates their correctness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to ensure RL policies align with human expectations by providing correct and understandable textual explanations, addressing gaps in current XRL evaluations.

Method: The framework uses LLMs and clustering to generate textual explanations, converts them into rules, and refines them using expert knowledge and automated predicates. It evaluates fidelity, properties, and performance.

Result: Experiments in open-source and telecom environments show the framework improves explanation quality and achieves satisfactory task performance. It outperforms existing methods like Autonomous Policy Explanation.

Conclusion: The proposed XRL framework systematically evaluates and refines textual explanations, offering quantitative insights and industrial applicability for the field.

Abstract: Understanding a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy is crucial for ensuring that autonomous agents behave according to human expectations. This goal can be achieved using Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) techniques. Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field.

TL;DR: SimpleMem is an efficient memory framework using semantic lossless compression to improve LLM agents' interaction handling. It outperforms baselines in accuracy and efficiency, reducing token use significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for LLM agents' memory management are either redundant or costly. SimpleMem aims to balance performance and efficiency.

Method: SimpleMem employs a three-stage pipeline: Semantic Structured Compression, Recursive Memory Consolidation, and Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval.

Result: Achieves 26.4% higher F1 and reduces token use by up to 30x compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SimpleMem effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, offering a robust solution for LLM memory systems.

Abstract: To support reliable long-term interaction in complex environments, LLM agents require memory systems that efficiently manage historical experiences. Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

*Alexander Roman,Jacob Roman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orchestral is a lightweight Python framework designed to unify LLM agent development across providers, addressing API fragmentation and complexity while ensuring simplicity and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of LLM agent frameworks has led to vendor lock-in and fragmented ecosystems, making it hard to build portable, reliable systems. Orchestral aims to solve these challenges.

Method: Orchestral provides a unified, type-safe interface with universal representations for messages and tools, automatic schema generation from Python type hints, synchronous execution, and modular architecture.

Result: The framework simplifies LLM agent development, eliminates manual format translation, ensures deterministic behavior, and supports advanced features like tool calling and memory management.

Conclusion: Orchestral effectively addresses the challenges of fragmented APIs and complexity in LLM agent frameworks, offering a streamlined solution for both scientific computing and production deployment.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in real-world deployment of on-device AI, particularly CPU utilization and thermal conditions, by evaluating model selection and domain adaptation potential.

Method: Conducted extensive experiments on five mobile devices using LiveChatBench, a manually constructed benchmark of 1,000 Korean-English sentence pairs.

Result: Demonstrated that careful consideration of deployment constraints and model selection can yield performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-5.1 for targeted tasks.

Conclusion: The findings offer valuable insights for the on-device AI community, highlighting practical considerations for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Despite its efficiency, there has been little research on the practical aspects required for real-world deployment of on-device AI models, such as the device's CPU utilization and thermal conditions. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we investigate two key issues that must be addressed to deploy on-device models in real-world services: (i) the selection of on-device models and the resource consumption of each model, and (ii) the capability and potential of on-device models for domain adaptation. To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task. We expect that our findings will provide meaningful insights to the on-device AI community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions for infeasible queries either fail or relax constraints arbitrarily, often ignoring user intent.

Method: Three LLM-based approaches—local weighting, global one-shot weighting, and pairwise ranking—are proposed to infer constraint importance from dialogue.

Result: Local weighting aligns best with user preferences, while global weighting excels in correct constraint relaxation.

Conclusion: The paper introduces AWARE-US benchmark and demonstrates LLM-based methods can effectively resolve infeasibility while preserving user intent.

Abstract: Tool-calling conversational agents querying structured databases often face two linked failures: underspecification (missing constraints needed to run a precise query) and infeasibility (the fully specified query returns an empty set because no item satisfies all constraints). Existing work often responds with "no results" or relaxes constraints using ad hoc rules, which can violate user intent by discarding requirements the user cares about most. We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation. We also introduce AWARE-US, a benchmark of persona-grounded queries requiring agents to disambiguate requests via conversation and resolve infeasibility in a way consistent with persona-implied preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of black-box RL in overlooking how local changes propagate through networks, improving sample efficiency and interpretability.

Method: Simultaneously learns policies and mines Causal GTL specifications, uses robustness-shaped rewards, collects counterexamples, and employs GP-driven Bayesian optimization.

Result: Demonstrated faster learning and clearer, verifiable behavior in gene and power networks compared to standard RL.

Conclusion: GTL-CIRL enhances decision-making efficiency and interpretability in spatial-temporal networks.

Abstract: Decision-making tasks often unfold on graphs with spatial-temporal dynamics. Black-box reinforcement learning often overlooks how local changes spread through network structure, limiting sample efficiency and interpretability. We present GTL-CIRL, a closed-loop framework that simultaneously learns policies and mines Causal Graph Temporal Logic (Causal GTL) specifications. The method shapes rewards with robustness, collects counterexamples when effects fail, and uses Gaussian Process (GP) driven Bayesian optimization to refine parameterized cause templates. The GP models capture spatial and temporal correlations in the system dynamics, enabling efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces. Case studies in gene and power networks show faster learning and clearer, verifiable behavior compared to standard RL baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfiAgent is a framework that externalizes persistent state to manage long-horizon tasks efficiently, avoiding context growth and errors, and performs competitively without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing breakdowns in LLM agents on long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors.

Method: Externalizes persistent state into a file-centric abstraction, reconstructing context from snapshots and recent actions.

Result: Competes with larger proprietary systems and maintains higher long-horizon coverage than baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit state externalization is practical for stable long-horizon agents.

Abstract: LLM agents can reason and use tools, but they often break down on long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors. Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents. Github Repo:https://github.com/ChenglinPoly/infiAgent

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAPO framework introduces dynamic attribution, semantic-unit optimization, and multimodal support to enhance prompt engineering efficiency and interpretability, addressing issues like prompt drift and performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt optimization is crucial for improving performance in large language models, but current methods suffer from prompt drift and interpretability issues.

Method: Proposes HAPO with dynamic attribution, semantic-unit optimization, and multimodal-friendly progression for efficient and interpretable prompt engineering.

Result: HAPO outperforms comparable methods in optimization efficiency and scalability, demonstrated in tasks like single/multi-image QA and complex task analysis.

Conclusion: HAPO provides an effective, scalable solution for prompt engineering, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Optimization is fundamental across numerous disciplines, typically following an iterative process of refining an initial solution to enhance performance. This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows. Applied in contexts like single/multi-image QA (e.g., OCRV2) and complex task analysis (e.g., BBH), HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency, outperforming comparable automated prompt optimization methods and establishing an extensible paradigm for scalable prompt engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance long-term user-agent relationships and collaboration quality by adapting to user preferences through continuous interaction.

Method: Introduces MultiSessionCollab, a benchmark, and equips agents with persistent memory to refine user preferences. Uses user simulator behavior to derive learning signals for training agents.

Result: Agents with memory achieve higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort. A human user study confirms improved real-world user experience.

Conclusion: Memory-equipped agents significantly improve long-term collaboration and user experience, as validated by experiments and human studies.

Abstract: As conversational agents accumulate experience collaborating with users, adapting to user preferences is essential for fostering long-term relationships and improving collaboration quality over time. We introduce MultiSessionCollab, a benchmark that evaluates how well agents can learn user preferences and leverage them to improve collaboration quality throughout multiple sessions. To develop agents that succeed in this setting, we present long-term collaborative agents equipped with a memory that persists and refines user preference as interaction experience accumulates. Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively. Extensive experiments show that equipping agents with memory improves long-term collaboration, yielding higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort. Finally, we conduct a human user study that demonstrates that memory helps improve user experience in real-world settings.

### [206] [Time-Scaling Is What Agents Need Now](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02714)
*Zhi Liu,Guangzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the convergence of AI paradigms into cognitive agents with closed-loop capabilities and the need for 'Time-Scaling' to enhance deep reasoning and problem-solving by extending reasoning over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of early large language models (LLMs) in robust semantic reasoning and to explore how temporalized sequential reasoning, akin to human cognition, can improve AI's problem-solving abilities.

Method: The method involves 'Time-Scaling,' which extends and optimizes reasoning over time through architectural designs like extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper exploration and dynamic strategy adjustment.

Result: Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 show enhanced performance with explicit reasoning trajectories, but limitations in search completeness and efficiency remain.

Conclusion: 'Time-Scaling' is identified as a critical frontier for advancing intelligent agents, emphasizing explicit temporal reasoning management to improve deep reasoning without increasing static model parameters.

Abstract: Early artificial intelligence paradigms exhibited separated cognitive functions: Neural Networks focused on "perception-representation," Reinforcement Learning on "decision-making-behavior," and Symbolic AI on "knowledge-reasoning." With Transformer-based large models and world models, these paradigms are converging into cognitive agents with closed-loop "perception-decision-action" capabilities.
  Humans solve complex problems under limited cognitive resources through temporalized sequential reasoning. Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning. While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) extended reasoning paths by making intermediate steps explicit. Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 enhanced performance through explicit reasoning trajectories. However, these methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency.
  This highlights the need for "Time-Scaling"--the systematic extension and optimization of an agent's ability to unfold reasoning over time. Time-Scaling refers to architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints. It represents a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportional increases in static model parameters. Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes resolving technical gaps and prioritizing research in robustness and ethics to responsibly deploy agentic AI.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text generators to autonomous, goal-driven systems represents a fundamental shift in artificial intelligence. This chapter examines the emergence of agentic AI systems that integrate planning, memory, tool use, and iterative reasoning to operate autonomously in complex environments. We trace the architectural progression from statistical models to transformer-based systems, identifying capabilities that enable agentic behavior: long-range reasoning, contextual awareness, and adaptive decision-making. The chapter provides three contributions: (1) a synthesis of how LLM capabilities extend toward agency through reasoning-action-reflection loops; (2) an integrative framework describing core components perception, memory, planning, and tool execution that bridge LLMs with autonomous behavior; (3) a critical assessment of applications and persistent challenges in safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike existing surveys, we focus on the architectural transition from language understanding to autonomous action, emphasizing the technical gaps that must be resolved before deployment. We identify critical research priorities, including verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory architectures, and governance frameworks. Responsible advancement requires simultaneous progress in technical robustness, interpretability, and ethical safeguards to realize potential while mitigating risks of misalignment and unintended consequences.

Method: Hierarchical framework combining LLMs and vision models to reduce hallucination and enhance tool selection.

Result: Achieved 90.71% Match rate, excelling in multi-step reasoning and robust tool selection.

Conclusion: ChangeGPT provides an intelligent, adaptable solution for remote sensing decision-making.

Abstract: Existing change detection methods often lack the versatility to handle diverse real-world queries and the intelligence for comprehensive analysis. This paper presents a general agent framework, integrating Large Language Models (LLM) with vision foundation models to form ChangeGPT. A hierarchical structure is employed to mitigate hallucination. The agent was evaluated on a curated dataset of 140 questions categorized by real-world scenarios, encompassing various question types (e.g., Size, Class, Number) and complexities. The evaluation assessed the agent's tool selection ability (Precision/Recall) and overall query accuracy (Match). ChangeGPT, especially with a GPT-4-turbo backend, demonstrated superior performance, achieving a 90.71 % Match rate. Its strength lies particularly in handling change-related queries requiring multi-step reasoning and robust tool selection. Practical effectiveness was further validated through a real-world urban change monitoring case study in Qianhai Bay, Shenzhen. By providing intelligence, adaptability, and multi-type change analysis, ChangeGPT offers a powerful solution for decision-making in remote sensing applications.

*Masum Hasan,Junjie Zhao,Ehsan Hoque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAL is a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness by deriving explicit traits from dialogue data and using them as a transparent reward for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving human-likeness in AI conversations is challenging and often relies on scale or broad training, lacking targeted alignment methods.

Method: HAL derives conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a scalar score, and uses it as a reward for preference optimization.

Result: Models aligned with HAL are perceived as more human-like without affecting overall performance, and the framework allows for interpretable alignment.

Conclusion: HAL provides a measurable, interpretable way to align AI models with soft conversational traits, expanding the scope of alignment beyond traditional metrics.

Abstract: Conversational human-likeness plays a central role in human-AI interaction, yet it has remained difficult to define, measure, and optimize. As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.

TL;DR: The paper addresses AI hallucinations in systematic reviews by introducing a causal graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation system, achieving high accuracy and zero hallucinations in a dementia-focused evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual systematic reviews of over 1.5 million annual medical publications are impractical, and existing AI methods suffer from unacceptable hallucination rates (2--40%), impacting patient care.

Method: The proposed system integrates causal reasoning with dual-level knowledge graphs, enforcing evidence-first protocols and automatically generating directed acyclic graphs for intervention-outcome pathways.

Result: Evaluated on 234 dementia exercise abstracts, the system achieved 95% accuracy, 100% retrieval success, and zero hallucinations, outperforming baseline AI (34% accuracy, 10% hallucinations).

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates transferable principles for trustworthy medical AI, highlighting causal reasoning's potential in high-stakes healthcare, though tested on a limited scope (dementia exercise research).

Abstract: Systematic reviews are essential for evidence-based medicine, but reviewing 1.5 million+ annual publications manually is infeasible. Current AI approaches suffer from hallucinations in systematic review tasks, with studies reporting rates ranging from 28--40% for earlier models to 2--15% for modern implementations which is unacceptable when errors impact patient care.
  We present a causal graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation system integrating explicit causal reasoning with dual-level knowledge graphs. Our approach enforces evidence-first protocols where every causal claim traces to retrieved literature and automatically generates directed acyclic graphs visualizing intervention-outcome pathways.
  Evaluation on 234 dementia exercise abstracts shows CausalAgent achieves 95% accuracy, 100% retrieval success, and zero hallucinations versus 34% accuracy and 10% hallucinations for baseline AI. Automatic causal graphs enable explicit mechanism modeling, visual synthesis, and enhanced interpretability. While this proof-of-concept evaluation used ten questions focused on dementia exercise research, the architectural approach demonstrates transferable principles for trustworthy medical AI and causal reasoning's potential for high-stakes healthcare.

*Muzhen Zhang,Yujie Cheng,Zhanxiang Lei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quantum-enhanced LSTM model (QLSTMA) for permeability prediction in reservoirs, showing significant improvement over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with permeability prediction due to its variability. Quantum-enhanced models aim to address this gap.

Method: QLSTMA integrates variational quantum circuits into LSTM cells, testing two structures (SG and IG) with varying qubit counts.

Result: The 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model reduced MAE by 19% and RMSE by 20%, excelling in complex regions.

Conclusion: Quantum-classical hybrid models show promise for reservoir prediction, with potential for further gains using more qubits.

Abstract: Spatial prediction of reservoir parameters, especially permeability, is crucial for oil and gas exploration and development. However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art DRL algorithms often require large datasets and struggle with generalization beyond small-scale scenarios.

Method: Partial policies from simple tasks are transferred as logical rules to guide training, biasing action distribution and rescaling Q-values.

Result: The approach improves convergence, interpretability, and performance in sparse-reward and partially observable environments, outperforming a baseline.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic DRL with symbolic knowledge integration offers efficient, generalizable solutions for complex tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-established framework for sequential decision-making in complex environments. However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting. We show improved performance over a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline.

Motivation: Existing MAD research lacks unified evaluation settings and is limited to single-modality (text-only) scenarios, hindering fair comparisons and broader applicability.

Method: M3MAD-Bench provides standardized protocols for five core task domains, covers text and vision-language datasets, and evaluates nine base models with multi-dimensional metrics.

Result: The benchmark enables controlled cross-modality comparisons and reveals insights into MAD's effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency in text-only and multimodal settings.

Conclusion: M3MAD-Bench establishes a reliable foundation for future research on standardized MAD evaluation, promoting fair comparisons and broader applicability.

Abstract: As an agent-level reasoning and coordination paradigm, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) orchestrates multiple agents through structured debate to improve answer quality and support complex reasoning. However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios. We believe M3MAD-Bench offers a reliable foundation for future research on standardized MAD evaluation. The code is available at http://github.com/liaolea/M3MAD-Bench.

TL;DR: SimRPD is a three-stage framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents, addressing data scarcity with a high-fidelity user simulator, multi-dimensional evaluation, and effective training, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data limits the performance of task-oriented proactive dialogue agents in recruitment.

Method: SimRPD involves synthesizing conversational data via a user simulator, evaluating data quality with a multi-dimensional framework (Chain-of-Intention), and training the agent on selected high-quality data.

Result: SimRPD outperforms existing simulator-based data selection strategies in real-world recruitment scenarios.

Conclusion: SimRPD offers practical value for industrial deployment and potential applicability to other business-oriented dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: Task-oriented proactive dialogue agents play a pivotal role in recruitment, particularly for steering conversations towards specific business outcomes, such as acquiring social-media contacts for private-channel conversion. Although supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning have proven effective for training such agents, their performance is heavily constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data. To address this challenge, we propose SimRPD, a three-stage framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents. First, we develop a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. Then we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) to comprehensively assess the simulator and effectively select high-quality data, incorporating both global-level and instance-level metrics. Finally, we train the recruitment proactive dialogue agent on the selected dataset. Experiments in a real-world recruitment scenario demonstrate that SimRPD outperforms existing simulator-based data selection strategies, highlighting its practical value for industrial deployment and its potential applicability to other business-oriented dialogue scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current LLM reasoning approaches by enhancing structured exploration, validation, and persistent learning.

Method: Combines Tree-of-Thoughts, iterative self-critique, dual validation, reflexion memory, and critique-based pruning.

Result: Outperforms ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine on mathematical and creative writing tasks.

Conclusion: ReTreVal excels in tasks needing exploratory reasoning, verification, and knowledge transfer due to its structured validation and memory features.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning remains a key challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in complex domains such as mathematics and creative writing. While recent approaches including ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine improve reasoning through iterative refinement and reflection, they often lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems. We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve LLMs' symbolic logical reasoning, crucial for high-stakes domains like math and law.

Method: Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning aligns natural language with logic symbols and targets phase-transition boundaries.

Result: The approach mitigates reasoning collapses, boosting accuracy (+1.26 naive, +3.95 CoT) and enhancing generalization.

Conclusion: Logical Phase Transitions exist in LLMs, and the proposed framework effectively strengthens reasoning at higher complexities.

Abstract: Symbolic logical reasoning is a critical yet underexplored capability of large language models (LLMs), providing reliable and verifiable decision-making in high-stakes domains such as mathematical reasoning and legal judgment. In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

TL;DR: BoT-R, a batch-aware reasoning method, improves LLM accuracy and efficiency by leveraging cross-instance signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM reasoning systems ignore valuable cross-instance signals like shared patterns and consistency, limiting performance and efficiency.

Method: Introduces Batch-of-Thought (BoT) to process related queries jointly, enabling cross-instance learning, error detection, and cost amortization. BoT-R extends this with multi-agent reflection for mutual information gain.

Result: BoT-R boosts accuracy and confidence calibration while cutting inference costs by up to 61% across three model families and six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Batch-aware reasoning (BoT-R) enhances LLM systems by unlocking mutual information and efficiency, validated theoretically and experimentally.

Abstract: Current Large Language Model reasoning systems process queries independently, discarding valuable cross-instance signals such as shared reasoning patterns and consistency constraints. We introduce Batch-of-Thought (BoT), a training-free method that processes related queries jointly to enable cross-instance learning. By performing comparative analysis across batches, BoT identifies high-quality reasoning templates, detects errors through consistency checks, and amortizes computational costs. We instantiate BoT within a multi-agent reflection architecture (BoT-R), where a Reflector performs joint evaluation to unlock mutual information gain unavailable in isolated processing. Experiments across three model families and six benchmarks demonstrate that BoT-R consistently improves accuracy and confidence calibration while reducing inference costs by up to 61%. Our theoretical and experimental analysis reveals when and why batch-aware reasoning benefits LLM systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the underperformance of multimodal large language models in time series reasoning by introducing rationale-grounded in-context learning, proposing RationaleTS to connect temporal observations with outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack rationale priors linking temporal observations to outcomes, leading to superficial pattern matching instead of principled reasoning.

Method: RationaleTS introduces label-conditioned rationales and hybrid retrieval balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts for in-context inference.

Result: The method is validated through experiments on three-domain time series reasoning tasks, showing effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: RationaleTS improves time series reasoning by grounding rationales in observations, with code to be released for reproduction.

Abstract: The underperformance of existing multimodal large language models for time series reasoning lies in the absence of rationale priors that connect temporal observations to their downstream outcomes, which leads models to rely on superficial pattern matching rather than principled reasoning. We therefore propose the rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, where rationales work as guiding reasoning units rather than post-hoc explanations, and develop the RationaleTS method. Specifically, we firstly induce label-conditioned rationales, composed of reasoning paths from observable evidence to the potential outcomes. Then, we design the hybrid retrieval by balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts to retrieve correlated rationale priors for the final in-context inference on new samples. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RationaleTS on three-domain time series reasoning tasks. We will release our code for reproduction.

### [219] [Explainable Fuzzy GNNs for Leak Detection in Water Distribution Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03062)
*Qusai Khaled,Pasquale De Marinis,Moez Louati,David Ferras,Laura Genga,Uzay Kaymak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an explainable GNN framework for leak detection in water networks, balancing performance with intuitive fuzzy logic explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely leak detection is crucial for resource conservation and operational efficiency, but existing GNNs lack explainability for practical use.

Method: The framework integrates mutual information for critical region identification and fuzzy logic for rule-based explanations. A fuzzy-enhanced GENConv variant was developed.

Result: FGENConv achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 (detection) and 0.814 (localization), slightly below GENConv but with added explainability.

Conclusion: The fuzzy GNN balances precision and explainability, aiding engineers in validating leaks and optimizing maintenance. Code is available online.

Abstract: Timely leak detection in water distribution networks is critical for conserving resources and maintaining operational efficiency. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies.

### [220] [A framework for assuring the accuracy and fidelity of an AI-enabled Digital Twin of en route UK airspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03120)
*Adam Keane,Nick Pepper,Chris Burr,Amy Hodgkin,Dewi Gould,John Korna,Marc Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of a probabilistic Digital Twin for UK airspace, focusing on AI ATC agent training. It introduces an assurance framework leveraging TEA methodology to ensure accuracy and functionality, aiding regulatory compliance and stakeholder engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aviation industry stands to benefit significantly from Digital Twins combined with AI. However, regulatory requirements are emerging and need tailored approaches for specific use cases, necessitating a structured assurance framework.

Method: The paper presents an assurance framework developed using Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) methodology. This framework defines goals, required evidence, and structured arguments to validate Digital Twin accuracy and functionality for target use cases.

Result: The framework provides actionable goals and evidence requirements, enabling researchers to assess Digital Twin strengths/limitations and improve fidelity. It also supports stakeholder and regulator engagement.

Conclusion: The proposed assurance framework serves as a practical tool for validating Digital Twins in aviation, addressing regulatory needs and contributing to emerging guidance through concrete examples.

Abstract: Digital Twins combine simulation, operational data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and have the potential to bring significant benefits across the aviation industry. Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.
  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.
  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised. In this paper we provide an overview of each structured argument and a number of deep dives which elaborate in more detail upon particular arguments, including the required evidence, assumptions and justifications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple yet effective system for automatic prompt engineering, requiring no tuning or task-specific clues, and applies it to cryptic column name expansion in databases, a largely unexplored task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of existing work on cryptic column name expansion in databases, a critical task for data search and understanding, while also extending automatic prompt engineering to non-English languages.

Method: The method involves a system for automatic prompt engineering that is simple in design and application, requiring no tuning or explicit task clues. It is evaluated on datasets in English and German.

Result: The approach is shown to be effective for cryptic column name expansion, marking the first application of automatic prompt engineering for this task and the first in a non-English language.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed system is a simple and effective solution for automatic prompt engineering, applicable to cryptic column name expansion and extending its use beyond English.

Abstract: This paper presents a system for automatic prompt engineering that is much simpler in both design and application and yet as effective as the existing approaches. It requires no tuning and no explicit clues about the task. We evaluated our approach on cryptic column name expansion (CNE) in database tables, a task which is critical for tabular data search, access, and understanding and yet there has been very little existing work. We evaluated on datasets in two languages, English and German. This is the first work to report on the application of automatic prompt engineering for the CNE task. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work on the application of automatic prompt engineering for a language other than English.

### [222] [MAGMA: A Multi-Graph based Agentic Memory Architecture for AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03236)
*Dongming Jiang,Yi Li,Guanpeng Li,Bingzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGMA introduces a multi-graph memory architecture for LLMs, improving long-context reasoning by decoupling memory representation and retrieval, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory-augmented LLMs rely on monolithic memory stores, limiting interpretability and reasoning accuracy due to entangled information.

Method: MAGMA uses orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs for memory representation and policy-guided traversal for retrieval.

Result: MAGMA outperforms state-of-the-art systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks.

Conclusion: MAGMA enhances reasoning accuracy and interpretability by structuring memory retrieval dynamically.

Abstract: Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) extends Large Language Models with external memory to support long-context reasoning, but existing approaches largely rely on semantic similarity over monolithic memory stores, entangling temporal, causal, and entity information. This design limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy. In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. MAGMA formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction. By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval demonstrate that MAGMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks.

### [223] [Stigmergic Swarming Agents for Fast Subgraph Isomorphism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02449)
*H. Van Dyke Parunak*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy) is a heuristic inspired by ant colony optimization for solving the NP-complete problem of maximum partial subgraph isomorphism. It achieves near-linear time complexity for the combinatorially complex part of the problem after an initial peering step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of finding a largest common subgraph between two graphs is NP-complete, with existing solutions being computationally expensive or impractical for large graphs. ASSIST aims to provide a faster and more efficient heuristic inspired by ant colony optimization.

Method: ASSIST uses an ant colony optimization approach, starting with a peering step to match individual nodes ($O(q \cdot log(d))$ time). The iterative subgraph search, the core of the problem, is linear in query size and constant in data size.

Result: ASSIST significantly reduces the time complexity for the combinatorial part of the problem compared to existing heuristics, achieving near-linear performance. It also supports extended matching problems like inexact matches or missing elements.

Conclusion: ASSIST offers a scalable and efficient solution for maximum partial subgraph isomorphism, outperforming current heuristics and accommodating complex matching scenarios.

Abstract: Maximum partial subgraph isomorphism compares two graphs (nodes joined by edges) to find a largest common subgraph. A common use case, for graphs with labeled nodes, seeks to find instances of a \textit{query} graph with $q$ nodes in a (typically larger) \textit{data} graph with $d$ nodes. The problem is NP-complete, and naïve solutions are exponential in $q + d$. The fastest current heuristic has complexity $O(d^2)$. This paper outlines ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy), inspired by the ant colony optimization approach to the traveling salesperson. After peering (identifying matching individual nodes in query and data) in time $O(q\cdot log(d))$, the time required for ASSIST's iterative subgraph search, the combinatorially complex part of the problem, is linear in query size and constant in data size. ASSIST can be extended to support matching problems (such as temporally ordered edges, inexact matches, and missing nodes or edges in the data graph) that frustrate other heuristics.

*Péter Molnár*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A microscopic pedestrian flow model using social force theory shows how simple individual behaviors create complex collective patterns, influenced by building geometry, and includes optimization methods for infrastructure design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a realistic pedestrian flow model for designing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure and verify social science theories with empirical data.

Method: Combines social force theory with individual behavior rules (goal-directed movement and distance maintenance), integrates an evolutionary algorithm for building layout optimization, and includes decision-making and adaptation models.

Result: Demonstrates emergent collective behaviors like trail formation, strong dependency on building geometry, and efficiency improvements through geometric adjustments.

Conclusion: The model effectively captures pedestrian dynamics, optimizes infrastructure design, and enhances understanding of self-organized systems in pedestrian flows.

Abstract: This work presents a microscopic model to describe pedestrian flows based on the social force theory. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) developing a realistic model that can be used as a tool for designing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and (2) verifying a social science theory using a model with sufficient data. The investigation of the pedestrian model shows that despite simple individual behavior patterns, complex spatial and temporal structures emerge through the interactions in pedestrian flows. Collective behavior emerges from individuals following two basic rules: (1) moving directly towards their goal at a certain speed, and (2) maintaining a distance to other pedestrians and obstacles. This self-organized collective behavior manifests itself as trails that are formed by pedestrians moving in one direction. Furthermore, strong dependencies of the properties of pedestrian flows on geometric forms of buildings are shown, and the influence of geometric changes on performance characteristics is investigated. An example demonstrates how efficiency can be increased by reducing walkable areas. This work also presents an evolutionary algorithm for optimizing building layouts based on the social force model. Additionally, a decision-making model is integrated to describe alternative goal selection, and adaptation and learning capabilities are included to improve pedestrian avoidance behavior and decision strategies based on accumulated experience. A method for determining load distributions in individual sections of a path system considering subjective selection criteria is also developed. Finally, a model that describes the self-organization of path systems with minimal detours is presented, similar to natural transport networks where total length and material costs are optimized.
