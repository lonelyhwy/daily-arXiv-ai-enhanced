Result: A comprehensive dataset spanning various drone models and conditions, with interoperable open-source tools for data handling and evaluation.

Conclusion: CDRF aims to standardize benchmarking and accelerate the development of robust RF perception models.

Abstract: We present CageDroneRF (CDRF), a large-scale benchmark for Radio-Frequency (RF) drone detection and identification built from real-world captures and systematically generated synthetic variants. CDRF addresses the scarcity and limited diversity of existing RF datasets by coupling extensive raw recordings with a principled augmentation pipeline that (i) precisely controls Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) injects interfering emitters, and (iii) applies frequency shifts with label-consistent bounding-box transformations for detection. This dataset spans a wide range of contemporary drone models, many unavailable in current public datasets, and acquisition conditions, derived from data collected at the Rowan University campus and within a controlled RF-cage facility. CDRF is released with interoperable open-source tools for data generation, preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation that also operate on existing public benchmarks. CDRF enables standardized benchmarking for classification, open-set recognition, and object detection, supporting rigorous comparisons and reproducible pipelines. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark and tooling, CDRF aims to accelerate progress toward robust, generalizable RF perception models.

### [3] [Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Concept Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03305)
*Jiahang Tu,Ye Li,Yiming Wu,Hanbin Zhao,Chao Zhang,Hui Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical concept erasure method (supertype-subtype) for diffusion models, using SuPLoRA to efficiently suppress multiple concepts while preserving general generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiency and ineffectiveness of existing concept erasure methods as the number of concepts grows, aiming to maintain generative capabilities while erasing harmful content.

Method: Introduces a supertype-subtype hierarchy for grouping erased concepts and SuPLoRA, which shares parameters for related concepts and updates only up-projection matrices to preserve supertype generation.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating performance degradation and introduces a challenging benchmark for diverse concept erasure.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical and parameter-sharing approach improves efficiency and effectiveness in erasing harmful concepts while maintaining overall generative quality.

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.

### [4] [VLM4VLA: Revisiting Vision-Language-Models in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03309)
*Jianke Zhang,Xiaoyu Chen,Qiuyue Wang,Mingsheng Li,Yanjiang Guo,Yucheng Hu,Jiajun Zhang,Shuai Bai,Junyang Lin,Jianyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how Vision-Language Model (VLM) choices affect Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies, finding that VLM general capabilities don't directly predict downstream performance and highlighting the visual module's importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how VLM selection and competence influence downstream VLA policy performance, challenging common assumptions about their role in embodied control.

Method: Introduces VLM4VLA, a simple pipeline adapting VLMs into VLA policies with minimal new parameters, and evaluates it across benchmarks and auxiliary embodied tasks.

Result: VLM initialization benefits VLA policies, but general VLM capabilities don't predict downstream success. Improving embodied skills doesn't guarantee better control, and the visual module is the bottleneck.

Conclusion: Current VLM pretraining objectives lack alignment with embodied action-planning needs, suggesting targeted supervision in vision encoders for better performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.

### [5] [Deep Learning-Based Image Recognition for Soft-Shell Shrimp Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03317)
*Yun-Hao Zhang,I-Hsien Ting,Dario Liberona,Yun-Hsiu Liu,Kazunori Minetaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based image recognition automates white shrimp classification post-harvest, improving freshness, efficiency, and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing rapid freshness decline and head-body separation in shrimp-based foods to meet rising consumer demand for quality.

Method: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for automated classification, replacing manual sorting.

Result: Enhances accuracy, efficiency, and freshness retention while reducing processing time.

Conclusion: Automated classification via CNN improves shrimp quality and meets customer demands effectively.

Abstract: With the integration of information technology into aquaculture, production has become more stable and continues to grow annually. As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively.

### [6] [Higher order PCA-like rotation-invariant features for detailed shape descriptors modulo rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03326)
*Jarek Duda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes extending PCA's covariance matrix to higher-order tensors or polynomial-Gaussian descriptors for more accurate rotation-invariant shape analysis, enabling applications like molecular shape descriptors and object recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real shapes are more complex than what PCA's covariance matrix (ellipsoid approximation) can describe, necessitating higher-order descriptors for better accuracy.

Method: Extends PCA's covariance matrix to higher-order tensors (e.g., order-3) or polynomial-Gaussian descriptors to capture intricate shape details and derive rotation invariants.

Result: Enables creation of more accurate rotation-invariant shape descriptors, applicable to molecular shapes, object recognition, and shape similarity metrics.

Conclusion: Higher-order descriptors improve rotation-invariant shape analysis, offering practical benefits in fields like chemistry and computer vision.

Abstract: PCA can be used for rotation invariant features, describing a shape with its $p_{ab}=E[(x_i-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])]$ covariance matrix approximating shape by ellipsoid, allowing for rotation invariants like its traces of powers. However, real shapes are usually much more complicated, hence there is proposed its extension to e.g. $p_{abc}=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]$ order-3 or higher tensors describing central moments, or polynomial times Gaussian allowing decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy, and their analogous rotation invariants. Its practical applications could be rotation-invariant features to include shape modulo rotation e.g. for molecular shape descriptors, or for up to rotation object recognition in 2D images/3D scans, or shape similarity metric allowing their inexpensive comparison (modulo rotation) without costly optimization over rotations.

### [7] [MMErroR: A Benchmark for Erroneous Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03331)
*Yang Shi,Yifeng Xie,Minzhe Guo,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Jingchao Wang,Zhihong Zhu,Boyan Xu,Zhiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMErroR benchmark evaluates VLMs' ability to detect and classify multi-modal reasoning errors, revealing challenges even for top models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether VLMs truly understand content by testing their ability to detect and classify reasoning errors in multi-modal contexts.

Method: Created MMErroR, a benchmark with 2,013 samples spanning 24 subdomains, embedding single coherent errors for evaluation.

Result: Best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) achieved only 66.47% accuracy in error classification, highlighting the difficulty.

Conclusion: MMErroR reveals limitations in VLMs' error detection capabilities, providing insights into multi-modal reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io

### [8] [RelightAnyone: A Generalized Relightable 3D Gaussian Head Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03357)
*Yingyan Xu,Pramod Rao,Sebastian Weiss,Gaspard Zoss,Markus Gross,Christian Theobalt,Marc Habermann,Derek Bradley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage method for relighting 3D Gaussian head avatars without requiring OLAT data, generalizing well from flat-lit avatars to relightable ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing relighting methods need complex OLAT data; this work aims to relight avatars from single- or multi-view images without OLAT.

Method: A two-stage model: first trains flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT, then maps them to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting.

Result: Generalizes well to relight any subject as if OLAT data were available, even fitting unseen subjects from a single image.

Conclusion: Enables practical relighting applications without costly OLAT capture, advancing digital avatar realism.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a standard approach to reconstruct and render photorealistic 3D head avatars. A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.

### [9] [Guardians of the Hair: Rescuing Soft Boundaries in Depth, Stereo, and Novel Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03362)
*Xiang Zhang,Yang Zhang,Lukas Mehl,Markus Gross,Christopher Schroers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HairGuard is a framework for recovering soft boundary details in 3D vision, using a novel data pipeline, depth fixer network, and generative scene painter to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are challenging due to ambiguous foreground-background mixing. Existing methods struggle with fine-grained detail recovery.

Method: HairGuard includes a data curation pipeline using image matting datasets, a depth fixer network with a gated residual module for precise depth refinement, and a generative scene painter for view synthesis.

Result: HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance in monocular depth estimation, stereo conversion, and novel view synthesis, with notable improvements in soft boundary regions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses soft boundary challenges in 3D vision, offering plug-and-play integration and high-fidelity detail recovery.

Abstract: Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.

### [10] [RiskCueBench: Benchmarking Anticipatory Reasoning from Early Risk Cues in Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03369)
*Sha Luo,Yogesh Prabhu,Tim Ossowski,Kaiping Chen,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary: The paper introduces RiskCueBench, a new benchmark for video risk assessment, focusing on early visual signals to predict risky events, revealing gaps in current models' abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing datasets that include the full video sequence (including accidents), making the task easier. The goal is to better reflect real-world conditions where early risk signals are crucial.

Method: The authors introduce RiskCueBench, a benchmark where videos are annotated to identify the earliest risk signal clip indicating potential safety concerns.

Result: Experiments show significant gaps in current systems' ability to anticipate risky events from early visual signals.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges in deploying video risk prediction models in practice and emphasizes the need for models that can interpret evolving situations from early cues.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.

### [11] [A Novel Unified Approach to Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03382)
*Lord Sen,Shyamapada Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel deepfake detection architecture using cross-attention and blood detection, outperforming SOTA with near-perfect accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing threat of deepfakes necessitates robust detection methods to maintain digital trust.

Method: Uses cross-attention between spatial/frequency features and a blood detection module, combining Swin Transformer/BERT or EfficientNet-B4/BERT.

Result: Achieves 99.80% (FF++) and 99.88% (Celeb-DF) AUC with Swin/BERT, and 99.55%/99.38% with EfficientNet/BERT; excels in cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture is highly effective and generalizable for deepfake detection, surpassing current benchmarks.

Abstract: The advancements in the field of AI is increasingly giving rise to various threats. One of the most prominent of them is the synthesis and misuse of Deepfakes. To sustain trust in this digital age, detection and tagging of deepfakes is very necessary. In this paper, a novel architecture for Deepfake detection in images and videos is presented. The architecture uses cross attention between spatial and frequency domain features along with a blood detection module to classify an image as real or fake. This paper aims to develop a unified architecture and provide insights into each step. Though this approach we achieve results better than SOTA, specifically 99.80%, 99.88% AUC on FF++ and Celeb-DF upon using Swin Transformer and BERT and 99.55, 99.38 while using EfficientNet-B4 and BERT. The approach also generalizes very well achieving great cross dataset results as well.

### [12] [Better, But Not Sufficient: Testing Video ANNs Against Macaque IT Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03392)
*Matteo Dunnhofer,Christian Micheloni,Kohitij Kar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current feedforward ANNs fall short in capturing the dynamic computations of primate IT cortex during naturalistic video viewing, highlighting the need for improved models that better simulate biological temporal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand whether inferior temporal (IT) cortex responses reflect simple static computations or richer dynamic processes during naturalistic video viewing, comparing them against various ANN models.

Method: Macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos were compared against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. A stress test involved evaluating decoders on appearance-free video variants to assess generalization.

Result: Video-based ANNs showed modest improvements in neural predictivity, but all ANN classes failed to generalize to appearance-free videos, unlike IT population activity.

Conclusion: Current video ANNs capture appearance-bound dynamics but not the appearance-invariant temporal computations seen in IT, pointing to the need for new modeling objectives.

Abstract: Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on static images remain the dominant models of the the primate ventral visual stream, yet they are intrinsically limited to static computations. The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on "appearance-free" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.

### [13] [Eye-Q: A Multilingual Benchmark for Visual Word Puzzle Solving and Image-to-Phrase Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03400)
*Ali Najar,Alireza Mirrokni,Arshia Izadyari,Sadegh Mohammadian,Amir Homayoon Sharifizade,Asal Meskin,Mobin Bagherian,Ehsaneddin Asgari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark for complex visual understanding through visual word puzzles, showing current VLMs struggle with deeper reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs often rely on surface-level recognition, lacking deeper reasoning skills. Eye-Q aims to challenge and assess these models with unstructured, cue-implicit puzzles.

Method: Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles requiring inference of target words/phrases from dense scenes and brief descriptions. It spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles, evaluated using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, with maximum accuracy at 60.27%.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack the ability for flexible image-to-phrase inference, highlighting gaps in conceptual representation and reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.

### [14] [GAMBIT: A Gamified Jailbreak Framework for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03416)
*Xiangdong Hu,Yangyang Jiang,Qin Hu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAMBIT is a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that exploits reasoning MLLMs' cognitive stages to bypass safety measures, achieving high attack success rates on models like Gemini and GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attacks on MLLMs underperform on reasoning models; GAMBIT aims to leverage human-like reasoning incentives to bypass safety mechanisms.

Method: Decomposes harmful visual semantics, constructs gamified scenes, and drives the model to explore and reconstruct intent, reducing safety focus.

Result: Achieves high ASR: 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, surpassing baselines.

Conclusion: GAMBIT effectively exploits reasoning models' cognitive processes, highlighting vulnerabilities in safety alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become widely deployed, yet their safety alignment remains fragile under adversarial inputs. Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agricultural models struggle to balance fine-grained feature extraction and real-time deployment efficiency.

Method: Integrates structural reparameterization across a Vision Transformer backbone, Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a reparameterizable classification head.

Result: Achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification with 3.59M parameters and 108.95 FPS.

Conclusion: Outperforms iFormer-T in accuracy while reducing parameters, proving efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: We present WeedRepFormer, a lightweight multi-task Vision Transformer designed for simultaneous waterhemp segmentation and gender classification. Existing agricultural models often struggle to balance the fine-grained feature extraction required for biological attribute classification with the efficiency needed for real-time deployment. To address this, WeedRepFormer systematically integrates structural reparameterization across the entire architecture - comprising a Vision Transformer backbone, a Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a novel reparameterizable classification head - to decouple training-time capacity from inference-time latency. We also introduce a comprehensive waterhemp dataset containing 10,264 annotated frames from 23 plants. On this benchmark, WeedRepFormer achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification using only 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs. At 108.95 FPS, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art iFormer-T by 4.40% in classification accuracy while maintaining competitive segmentation performance and significantly reducing parameter count by 1.9x.

TL;DR: FROST-Drive introduces a novel E2E autonomous driving model that uses a frozen pretrained vision encoder from a VLM to enhance generalization, outperforming fully fine-tuned models on complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of E2E models in generalizing to novel scenarios due to over-specialization from fine-tuning vision encoders on driving datasets.

Method: Proposes FROST-Drive with a frozen VLM encoder, transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion, GRU-based decoder for waypoints, and a custom RFS-optimized loss function.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on the Waymo Open E2E Dataset compared to fully fine-tuned models, highlighting better generalization.

Conclusion: Preserving a VLM's broad knowledge via frozen encoders is more effective for robust, generalizable driving performance than domain-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.

*Hengjia Li,Liming Jiang,Qing Yan,Yizhi Song,Hao Kang,Zichuan Liu,Xin Lu,Boxi Wu,Deng Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkRL-Edit is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances reasoning-centric image editing by decoupling reasoning from synthesis, improving exploration, reward fusion, and reward stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation addresses limitations in current instruction-driven image editing, particularly insufficient visual reasoning and challenges in RL-based methods like biased rewards and exploration.

Method: The method introduces Chain-of-Thought reasoning sampling, unbiased reward grouping, and binary checklist rewards to improve reasoning and generation stability.

Result: Results show superior performance over prior methods, achieving instruction-faithful, coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

Conclusion: ThinkRL-Edit effectively tackles key RL challenges, advancing reasoning-centric image editing.

Abstract: Instruction-driven image editing with unified multimodal generative models has advanced rapidly, yet their underlying visual reasoning remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance on reasoning-centric edits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms prior work on reasoning-centric image editing, producing instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

*Yunqi Hong,Kuei-Chun Kao,Hengguang Zhou,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies reward hacking in text-to-image reinforcement learning (RL) post-training, where models exploit imperfect reward functions to produce unrealistic images. It proposes an adaptive artifact reward model to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward designs in RL for text-to-image models are imperfect proxies for human judgment, leading to reward hacking and poor-quality outputs. The work aims to systematically analyze this issue and propose a solution.

Method: The study investigates individual contributions of aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards to reward hacking. It introduces a lightweight artifact reward model trained on curated datasets to act as a regularizer in RL pipelines.

Result: Experiments show that integrating the artifact reward improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking in various RL setups, confirming its effectiveness as a safeguard.

Conclusion: The proposed artifact reward model serves as a lightweight yet effective solution to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for text-to-image generation, enhancing output quality.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard approach for post-training large language models and, more recently, for improving image generation models, which uses reward functions to enhance generation quality and human preference alignment. However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating our artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple T2I RL setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight reward augment serving as a safeguard against reward hacking.

*Yuzhe Sun,Zhe Dong,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new uncertainty-guided framework improves remote sensing image segmentation by addressing spatial non-uniformity in cross-modal alignment using adaptive inference strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for referring remote sensing image segmentation struggle with spatial non-uniformity due to scale variations, distractors, and complex boundaries, leading to unreliable alignment.

Method: The proposed framework includes a Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS) trained via online error-consistency supervision, along with two modules: Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF) for adaptive language injection and Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR) for targeted refinement of error-prone areas.

Result: The method significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without changing the backbone architecture.

Conclusion: The uncertainty-guided framework provides a unified, plug-and-play solution that effectively addresses referential ambiguity and enhances segmentation accuracy in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation aims to localize specific targets described by natural language within complex overhead imagery. However, due to extreme scale variations, dense similar distractors, and intricate boundary structures, the reliability of cross-modal alignment exhibits significant \textbf{spatial non-uniformity}. Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an \textbf{uncertainty-guided framework} that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise \textbf{referring uncertainty map} as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play \textbf{Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS)}, which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) \textbf{Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF)}, which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) \textbf{Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR)}, which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDCD, a training-free algorithm, addresses object hallucination in LVLMs by penalizing texture-driven bias through structure-disrupted contrastive decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in LVLMs persists due to overlooked visual statistical bias from patch-based encoding, necessitating a solution.

Method: SDCD introduces shuffled structure-disrupted views to contrastively calibrate output distributions, reducing texture-driven biases.

Result: SDCD significantly reduces hallucinations across benchmarks and improves LVLMs' multimodal performance.

Conclusion: SDCD effectively tackles texture-driven bias in LVLMs, enhancing their reliability and multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geometry-only features struggle to distinguish objects with similar shapes but different appearances.

Method: G2P establishes point-wise correspondences between Gaussians and points, leveraging opacity for ambiguity resolution and scale for boundary precision.

Result: Achieves superior performance on benchmarks, especially for geometrically challenging classes, without 2D or language supervision.

Conclusion: G2P effectively enhances semantic segmentation by integrating appearance-aware attributes from Gaussians.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation on point clouds is critical for 3D scene understanding. However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models. Additionally, Gaussian scale attributes enable precise boundary localization in complex 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and shows significant improvements on geometrically challenging classes, all without any 2D or language supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCNet enhances thermal UAV image super-resolution by leveraging cross-resolution mutual enhancement and physics-driven thermal conduction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods compress optical features for cross-modal alignment, losing high-frequency info and causing artifacts, due to overlooked imaging physics differences.

Method: Uses Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) for bidirectional feature interaction and Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) to avoid artifacts.

Result: PCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on reconstruction quality and downstream tasks, verified on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets.

Conclusion: PCNet effectively addresses thermal UAV image super-resolution challenges by integrating cross-modal enhancement and physical constraints.

Abstract: Optics-guided thermal UAV image super-resolution has attracted significant research interest due to its potential in all-weather monitoring applications. However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CloudMatch is a semi-supervised framework for cloud detection in remote sensing imagery, leveraging unlabeled data through view-consistency learning and scene-mixing augmentations to capture cloud pattern diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation costs for pixel-level labels motivate the need for semi-supervised learning methods like CloudMatch to effectively use unlabeled data.

Method: CloudMatch employs view-consistency learning with weakly and strongly augmented views (inter-scene and intra-scene mixing) for pseudolabel generation and model training.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm CloudMatch's effectiveness in utilizing unlabeled data and improving semi-supervised cloud detection performance.

Conclusion: CloudMatch successfully captures cloud pattern diversity and enhances generalization, advancing semi-supervised cloud detection.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotating accurate pixel-level labels, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for cloud detection. In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EASLT, a gloss-free Sign Language Translation framework that integrates facial emotions as semantic anchors to resolve ambiguities caused by identical manual gestures. It achieves superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gloss-free SLT methods often ignore facial expressions, leading to semantic ambiguities. The paper aims to address this by treating facial affect as a key semantic component.

Method: EASLT uses an emotional encoder and an Emotion-Aware Fusion module to integrate affective dynamics with manual signals, adaptively recalibrating spatio-temporal features.

Result: EASLT outperforms other gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8 on PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling facial emotions enhances translation accuracy by decoupling affective semantics from manual dynamics, proving its critical role in SLT.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a complex cross-modal task requiring the integration of Manual Signals (MS) and Non-Manual Signals (NMS). While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

TL;DR: SpatiaLoc is a framework for cross-modal localization using text and point clouds, leveraging spatial relationships through a coarse-to-fine strategy with instance-level and global-level encoders, achieving SOTA performance on KITTI360Pose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robots to localize themselves via natural language descriptions by exploiting recurring objects and spatial relationships in text and point clouds.

Method: Coarse stage: BEOSE models instance-level spatial relationships with Bezier curves; FAE generates global-level spatial representations in frequency domain. Fine stage: UGFL regresses 2D positions using uncertainty-aware Gaussian distributions.

Result: SpatiaLoc outperforms existing SOTA methods on KITTI360Pose.

Conclusion: SpatiaLoc's emphasis on spatial relationships at multiple levels effectively improves cross-modal localization performance.

Abstract: Cross-modal localization using text and point clouds enables robots to localize themselves via natural language descriptions, with applications in autonomous navigation and interaction between humans and robots. In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy with a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to improve AI-generated image detection using the CLIP-ViT model, achieving high accuracy on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated images poses risks like misinformation, necessitating robust detection methods that generalize well to unseen models. Existing CLIP-based methods underutilize the image encoder's potential.

Method: Proposes MPFT with TAM to mask textured areas during fine-tuning, forcing CLIP-ViT to focus on deviations in AI-generated images.

Result: Achieves 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The MPFT strategy effectively enhances CLIP-ViT's generalization for AI-generated image detection, demonstrating superior performance with minimal training data.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has significantly enhanced the quality of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation and the erosion of public trust. Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the "distributional deviations"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SiT-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate spatial intelligence in LLMs without visual input, revealing a 'spatial gap' in global consistency and highlighting the potential of explicit spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether spatial intelligence in models stems from visual encoders or reasoning backbones, and to evaluate LLMs' spatial understanding without relying on pixel-level input.

Method: Created SiT-Bench, a dataset of 3,800 expert-annotated items across 5 categories and 17 subtasks, converting visual scenes into textual descriptions to test LLMs' symbolic reasoning.

Result: SOTA LLMs perform well in localized semantic tasks but lack global consistency ('spatial gap'). Explicit spatial reasoning improves performance, indicating latent world-modeling potential.

Conclusion: SiT-Bench provides a foundational resource to develop spatially-grounded LLMs for future VLMs and embodied agents, emphasizing the need for better global spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an environment-robust few-shot segmentation (FSS) setting and a benchmark (ER-FSS) to address challenges like motion blur and camouflaged targets. It proposes Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) to improve robustness, showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSS models fail in real-world scenarios due to environmental factors like illumination and background complexity. This gap motivates the development of a more robust FSS framework.

Method: The paper introduces AAD, which distills key semantics between support and query images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories, enhancing focus in complex environments.

Result: AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across datasets, demonstrating strong generalization and superior performance.

Conclusion: The proposed AAD method effectively enhances FSS robustness in dynamic real-world conditions, validated by significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to rapidly learn novel class concepts from limited examples to segment specific targets in unseen images, and has been widely applied in areas such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

*Pratyush Jena,Amal Joseph,Arnav Sharma,Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust patching strategy and Attention U-Net are introduced to improve binarization of challenging Indic stone inscriptions, showing strong generalization across scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast, degradation, and layout variability, causing existing techniques to fail.

Method: The approach uses an adaptive patching strategy to train an Attention U-Net, focusing on structural cues and overcoming noise. A new dataset of Indic inscriptions is also introduced.

Result: The method significantly boosts binarization performance and demonstrates zero-shot generalization to other scripts.

Conclusion: The approach provides clean representations for downstream tasks like OCR and script identification, showcasing robustness and script-agnostic capabilities.

Abstract: Binarization is a popular first step towards text extraction in historical artifacts. Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

### [33] [Systematic Evaluation of Depth Backbones and Semantic Cues for Monocular Pseudo-LiDAR 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03617)
*Samson Oseiwe Ajadalu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monocular 3D object detection is less accurate than LiDAR due to depth estimation challenges. NeWCRFs outperforms Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor in monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipelines, achieving 10.50% AP3D. Feature augmentations provide marginal gains, and geometric fidelity is key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve monocular 3D object detection by evaluating depth backbones and feature engineering, addressing the gap with LiDAR-based methods.

Method: Comparative evaluation of NeWCRFs and Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor in a Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline with PointRCNN detection, testing appearance and semantic cues.

Result: NeWCRFs achieves 10.50% AP3D, outperforming Depth Anything V2. Semantic augmentations offer minor improvements, while mask-based sampling can harm performance.

Conclusion: Depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity are critical for monocular 3D detection, with secondary features providing limited benefits.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a low-cost alternative to LiDAR, yet remains less accurate due to the difficulty of estimating metric depth from a single image. We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU. Overall, under an off-the-shelf LiDAR detector, depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate performance, outweighing secondary feature injection.

### [34] [Shape Classification using Approximately Convex Segment Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03625)
*Bimal Kumar Ray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method replacing object alignment with feature sorting for object classification, using normalized segments and a bag of features for similarity measurement, yielding acceptable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object classification relies on alignment for similarity computation, which this method seeks to eliminate.

Method: Normalizes object boundaries, segments them into convex parts, sorts by length, and uses a bag of features (segment length, extreme points, area, base, and width) to measure similarity.

Result: Tested on datasets, the method achieves acceptable classification results.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for object alignment while maintaining classification accuracy.

Abstract: The existing object classification techniques based on descriptive features rely on object alignment to compute the similarity of objects for classification. This paper replaces the necessity of object alignment through sorting of feature. The object boundary is normalized and segmented into approximately convex segments and the segments are then sorted in descending order of their length. The segment length, number of extreme points in segments, area of segments, the base and the width of the segments - a bag of features - is used to measure the similarity between image boundaries. The proposed method is tested on datasets and acceptable results are observed.

*Wenjie Luo,Chuanhu Deng,Chaorong Li,Rongyao Deng,Qiang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MFC-RFNet, a generative framework for high-resolution precipitation nowcasting, addressing challenges like multi-scale evolution, feature misalignment, and long-range context capture. It shows consistent improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate precipitation nowcasting is vital for disaster mitigation and economic planning, but existing methods struggle with multi-scale modeling, feature misalignment, and maintaining spatial fidelity while capturing long-range context.

Method: The MFC-RFNet framework integrates multi-scale communication and guided feature fusion. It uses WGSC for high-frequency detail preservation, FCM for cross-scale interaction, CGSTF for spatial alignment, and Vision-RWKV blocks for long-range dependencies. Rectified flow training enables efficient sampling.

Result: Evaluations on SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM datasets show improved clarity at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained performance at longer lead times compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MFC-RFNet effectively combines RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion, offering a robust solution for radar-based precipitation nowcasting.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation and economic planning, yet it remains a significant challenge. Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.

*Babak Asadi,Peiyang Wu,Mani Golparvar-Fard,Ramez Hajj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrackSegFlow is a framework for generating photorealistic crack images and masks, improving crack segmentation accuracy across domains without extra manual labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with scarce pixel-level labels and domain shifts in crack segmentation. CrackSegFlow aims to address these issues with controllable synthesis.

Method: Combines topology-preserving mask injection and boundary-gated modulation for realistic crack images, and uses class-conditional flow-matching for diverse mask synthesis.

Result: Improves in-domain performance by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and cross-domain gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1. Faster sampling than diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: CrackSegFlow effectively enhances crack segmentation with synthesized data, releasing CSF-50K for benchmarking.

Abstract: Automated crack segmentation is essential for scalable condition assessment of pavements and civil infrastructure, yet practical deployment is limited by scarce pixel-level labels and severe domain shift across sensors, illumination, textures, and annotation conventions. This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMemory is an entity-centric framework for consistent narrative video generation using a Dynamic Memory Bank to preserve entity identity and appearance across shots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining consistent characters, props, and environments across multiple shots is challenging in video generation, especially when scenes change or entities reappear after long gaps.

Method: VideoMemory integrates narrative planning with visual generation via a Dynamic Memory Bank, storing visual and semantic descriptors for entities. A multi-agent system decomposes scripts into shots, retrieves entity representations, and synthesizes videos conditioned on these states.

Result: VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality, as demonstrated on a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark.

Conclusion: VideoMemory effectively supports consistent long-form video generation by leveraging explicit memory updates and retrieval.

Abstract: Maintaining consistent characters, props, and environments across multiple shots is a central challenge in narrative video generation. Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.

TL;DR: MGPC is a multimodal point cloud completion framework using point clouds, RGB images, and text, featuring modality dropout, Transformer-based fusion, and progressive generation for robust and scalable 3D geometry recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the generalization challenges of existing methods for point cloud completion in novel objects and real-world scenarios.

Method: Integrates multimodal data (point clouds, images, text), employs modality dropout, Transformer fusion, and a progressive generator, supported by a large-scale dataset (MGPC-1M).

Result: Outperforms prior baselines on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: MGPC enhances robustness and scalability in point cloud completion, particularly for real-world applications.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover complete 3D geometry from partial observations caused by limited viewpoints and occlusions. Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks. However, due to the limitations of modality, scalability, and generative capacity, their generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.

TL;DR: A framework called PhysVideoGenerator embeds a physics prior into video generation to address unnatural dynamics, using PredictorP and V-JEPA 2 features integrated with a DiT-based generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models fail to capture real-world physics dynamics, leading to artifacts like unnatural collisions and temporal flickering.

Method: Proposes PhysVideoGenerator with PredictorP to regress physics features from diffusion latents and injects them into a DiT-based generator via cross-attention.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility: diffusion latents can recover V-JEPA 2 physics representations, and multi-task training remains stable.

Conclusion: Establishes a foundation for future large-scale physics-aware video generation models.

Abstract: Current video generation models produce high-quality aesthetic videos but often struggle to learn representations of real-world physics dynamics, resulting in artifacts such as unnatural object collisions, inconsistent gravity, and temporal flickering. In this work, we propose PhysVideoGenerator, a proof-of-concept framework that explicitly embeds a learnable physics prior into the video generation process. We introduce a lightweight predictor network, PredictorP, which regresses high-level physical features extracted from a pre-trained Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA 2) directly from noisy diffusion latents. These predicted physics tokens are injected into the temporal attention layers of a DiT-based generator (Latte) via a dedicated cross-attention mechanism. Our primary contribution is demonstrating the technical feasibility of this joint training paradigm: we show that diffusion latents contain sufficient information to recover V-JEPA 2 physical representations, and that multi-task optimization remains stable over training. This report documents the architectural design, technical challenges, and validation of training stability, establishing a foundation for future large-scale evaluation of physics-aware generative models.

*Dennis Holzmann,Sven Wachsmuth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel egocentric action recognition method uses 2D point tracks as motion cues, improving accuracy without relying on hand or object detection, outperforming RGB-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods depend on RGB appearance or pose estimation, but this paper explores the untapped potential of 2D point tracks for better motion representation.

Method: Randomly sampled image points are tracked across frames using CoTracker, and their trajectories are fed into a Transformer-based model with image frames.

Result: The method improves recognition accuracy, even with just initial frames and their point tracks, outperforming models without motion cues.

Conclusion: 2D point tracks are a lightweight yet effective motion representation for egocentric action recognition, offering consistent performance gains.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for egocentric action recognition that leverages 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue. While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework combining vision-language models (VLMs) with geometric methods for accurate 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization, addressing dataset limitations and computational inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale medical datasets and limitations in fine-grained pose regression and computational latency motivate the integration of VLMs with geometric methods for better localization.

Method: The authors construct the BREATH dataset and propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that combines VLMs' semantic understanding with geometric registration. They also introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism for temporal reasoning.

Result: BREATH-VL reduces translational error by 25.5% compared to state-of-the-art vision-only methods, achieving robust semantic localization and competitive computational latency.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach of BREATH-VL successfully leverages semantic and geometric cues, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in endoscopic camera localization.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in navigation and localization tasks by leveraging large-scale pretraining for semantic understanding. However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.

TL;DR: DA3 bridges the domain gap between simulation and real-world data in optical assembly, improving accuracy by 46% and reducing data collection time by 98.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the domain gap limiting simulation-trained models' generalization in high-precision optical assembly.

Method: Combines autoregressive domain transformation and adversarial feature alignment with self-supervised learning.

Result: DA3 improves accuracy by 46% and reduces real-world data collection time by 98.7%.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation makes simulation-trained models robust in real-world applications, enhancing optical assembly efficiency.

Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.

TL;DR: MATANet is a novel model for fine-grained marine species classification that integrates taxonomy and environmental context to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack contextual interactions and hierarchical taxonomic structure in marine animal classification, which MATANet aims to address.

Method: MATANet includes a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM) for ROI-environment relationships and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLIM) for taxonomic hierarchy encoding.

Result: Experiments on FathomNet2025, FAIR1M, and LifeCLEF2015-Fish datasets show state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MATANet successfully enhances fine-grained marine species classification by combining environmental and taxonomic features.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification of marine animals supports ecology, biodiversity and habitat conservation, and evidence-based policy-making. However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space. MATANet combines instance and environmental features with taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained classification. Experiments on the FathomNet2025, FAIR1M, and LifeCLEF2015-Fish datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Result: Outperforms VisDiff baseline with 47-50% accuracy on RadDiffBench. Demonstrates versatility in clinical tasks like COVID-19 analysis.

Conclusion: RadDiff and RadDiffBench establish a foundation for systematically analyzing radiological differences.

Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based methods struggle with ambiguous cues in real-world scenarios, and hyperspectral imaging offers finer spectral signatures, but lacked a dedicated benchmark for HCOD.

Method: HyperCOD benchmark includes 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images with complex scenarios. HSC-SAM adapts SAM by decoupling hyperspectral images into spatial and spectral maps for SAM's encoder and adaptive prompts.

Result: HSC-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on HyperCOD and generalizes well to other HSI datasets.

Conclusion: HyperCOD and HSC-SAM provide a robust foundation for future HCOD research, addressing the lack of benchmarks and bridging modality gaps effectively.

Abstract: RGB-based camouflaged object detection struggles in real-world scenarios where color and texture cues are ambiguous. While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.

TL;DR: I2E introduces a 'Decompose-then-Action' paradigm for precise image editing, outperforming existing methods in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods struggle with compositional tasks due to implicit planning-execution coupling, lack of object-level control, and pixel-centric modeling.

Method: I2E uses a Decomposer to break images into manipulable layers and a physics-aware agent to parse instructions into atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Result: I2E excels in complex instructions, physical plausibility, and multi-turn stability on I2E-Bench and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: I2E offers a structured, actionable approach to image editing, addressing key limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Existing text-guided image editing methods primarily rely on end-to-end pixel-level inpainting paradigm. Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.

### [47] [MVP: Enhancing Video Large Language Models via Self-supervised Masked Video Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03781)
*Xiaokun Sun,Zezhong Wu,Zewen Ding,Linli Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Masked Video Prediction (MVP), a novel post-training objective for Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) to improve temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations, enhancing fine-grained visual causality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning post-training paradigms for VideoLLMs focus on holistic content understanding but lack explicit supervision for temporal coherence and fine-grained causality, limiting their ability to capture intricate dynamics.

Method: Proposes MVP, requiring the model to reconstruct masked video segments from distractors, and introduces a scalable data synthesis pipeline and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function.

Result: MVP enhances VideoLLMs' temporal reasoning and causal understanding, as demonstrated by comprehensive evaluations.

Conclusion: MVP effectively bridges the gap in temporal coherence and fine-grained causality in VideoLLMs, improving their video reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training paradigms for Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved significant success by optimizing for visual-semantic tasks such as captioning or VideoQA. However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.

*Steven Moonen,Rob Salaets,Kenneth Batstone,Abdellatif Bey-Temsamani,Nick Michiels*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores synthetic data generation techniques for AI training in agriculture, focusing on replacing CAD models with 3D scans or image-to-3D methods to train object detection models for separating stones and potatoes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional synthetic data generation relies on CAD models, which are scarce in agriculture. The study aims to find alternative methods to create synthetic datasets for training AI models.

Method: The paper tests synthetic data generation using 3D models from scanning or image-to-3D techniques, followed by finetuning on small real datasets.

Result: Highly representative 3D models improve synthetic data quality, and finetuning enhances model performance, achieving results comparable to less representative models.

Conclusion: Alternative synthetic data methods, like 3D scanning, can effectively replace CAD models in agriculture, especially when combined with finetuning on real data.

Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, computer vision systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are widely used to reduce costs and increase production. Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.

*Usha Shrestha,Dmitry Ignatov,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a performance-aware, closed-loop method for data-aware augmentation in LLMs, reducing the need for brute-force search while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for data-aware augmentation in LLMs rely on heuristics or brute-force, limiting efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: The authors fine-tune LLMs using Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel dataset of PyTorch augmentation functions annotated by downstream accuracy, leveraging pairwise performance ordering for alignment.

Result: The approach achieves up to 600x fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force methods, maintains competitive accuracy, and shifts generation toward task-aligned design.

Conclusion: LLMs can internalize semantic performance cues and exhibit task-level reasoning without symbolic rewards, demonstrating the effectiveness of performance-aware augmentation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

### [51] [IDESplat: Iterative Depth Probability Estimation for Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03824)
*Wei Long,Haifeng Wu,Shiyin Jiang,Jinhua Zhang,Xinchun Ji,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDESplat improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by iteratively refining depth probability estimates for accurate Gaussian mean prediction, outperforming existing methods in reconstruction quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting Gaussian means rely on unstable single-warp depth estimation, limiting their ability to leverage cross-view geometric cues effectively.

Method: IDESplat introduces iterative warp operations via Depth Probability Boosting Units (DPBUs) and cascading attention maps to refine depth estimates and Gaussian means progressively.

Result: IDESplat achieves superior performance on RealEstate10K, ACID, DL3DV, and DTU datasets, outperforming DepthSplat in PSNR with fewer parameters and memory usage.

Conclusion: The iterative depth estimation approach in IDESplat enhances reconstruction quality and generalization, making it a robust solution for 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: MDENeRF refines monocular depth estimates using NeRF depth information, combining monocular structure with high-frequency details through Bayesian fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current monocular depth estimation methods often lack fine geometric details, which are crucial for accurate scene understanding in applications like autonomous navigation.

Method: MDENeRF uses an iterative framework with three components: initial monocular depth, NeRF depth with uncertainty, and Bayesian fusion to refine depth maps.

Result: The method shows superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

Conclusion: MDENeRF effectively enhances depth estimation by integrating monocular and NeRF depth information, improving detail retention and global structure.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has applications in many fields, such as autonomous navigation and extended reality, making it an essential computer vision task. However, current methods often produce smooth depth maps that lack the fine geometric detail needed for accurate scene understanding. We propose MDENeRF, an iterative framework that refines monocular depth estimates using depth information from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

*Yuyang Fu,Xiuzhen Guo,Ji Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVL-DRL is an end-to-end framework using staged reinforcement learning to improve medical image segmentation under noisy annotations, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy annotations in medical images limit segmentation model efficacy. SVL-DRL leverages annotator corrections via reinforcement learning.

Method: Dynamic iterative update strategy with voxel-level agents (vA3C) and a composite reward function combining Dice and spatial continuity.

Result: Average improvement of 3% in Dice and IoU scores on three public datasets.

Conclusion: SVL-DRL effectively mitigates noisy annotation impact, enhancing segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image segmentation. Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\% in both Dice and IoU scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flood damage assessment in India is slow and biased with traditional methods, and satellite-based approaches face resolution and cloud cover issues. FLNet aims to address these gaps.

Method: FLNet uses super-resolution to enhance Sentinel-2 satellite images from 10m to 3m resolution before classifying crop damage, tested on BFCD-22 dataset.

Result: FLNet improved the 'Full Damage' F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching commercial high-resolution imagery scores, proving cost-effective and scalable.

Conclusion: FLNet offers a viable, automated solution for accurate crop damage assessment, potentially replacing manual methods nationwide.

Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.

*Mingyu Ouyang,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusUI improves UI grounding efficiency by selecting relevant visual patches and preserving positional continuity, outperforming baselines with faster inference and lower memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VLMs tokenize high-resolution UI screenshots into thousands of visual tokens, causing computational overhead and diluted attention. Humans focus on regions of interest, suggesting a need for efficient UI grounding.

Method: FocusUI selects instruction-relevant patches using patch-level supervision (combining instruction-conditioned and UI-graph scores) and preserves positional continuity with PosPad, which compresses dropped tokens into special markers.

Result: FocusUI-7B outperforms GUI-Actor-7B by 3.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieves 1.44x faster inference, and uses 17% less GPU memory, even with only 30% token retention.

Conclusion: FocusUI efficiently grounds UI tasks by reducing redundant tokens and maintaining positional context, offering significant performance and computational benefits.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

*Xu Zhang,Cheng Da,Huan Yang,Kun Gai,Ming Lu,Zhan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResTok introduces a hierarchical residual tokenizer for autoregressive image generation, enhancing representational capacity and reducing sampling steps, achieving improved performance on ImageNet-256.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 1D visual tokenizers mimic language modeling, neglecting vision-specific hierarchical and residual properties, which are crucial for convergence and efficiency.

Method: ResTok builds hierarchical residuals for image and latent tokens, enabling cross-level feature fusion and semantic residuals. A hierarchical AR generator predicts entire token levels to reduce sampling steps.

Result: ResTok achieves a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps, demonstrating significant improvements in AR image generation.

Conclusion: Restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization enhances AR generation, bridging the gap between language-like tokenizers and vision-specific needs.

Abstract: Existing 1D visual tokenizers for autoregressive (AR) generation largely follow the design principles of language modeling, as they are built directly upon transformers whose priors originate in language, yielding single-hierarchy latent tokens and treating visual data as flat sequential token streams. However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring "vision" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FUSION, a diffusion-based motion prior for full-body synthesis, combining hand and body motion datasets. It outperforms existing methods in motion naturalness and enables novel applications like object interaction and self-interaction motions guided by language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hands are crucial for full-body motion synthesis, but existing methods often neglect them or are constrained. A lack of diverse, large-scale datasets capturing both hand and body motion is a key challenge.

Method: The authors curate and unify existing hand and body motion datasets. They propose FUSION, a diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, and an optimization pipeline for task-specific motion generation.

Result: FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models in motion naturalness and keypoint tracking. It enables precise hand control and plausible full-body coordination in applications like object interaction and self-interaction motions.

Conclusion: FUSION advances full-body motion synthesis by integrating hand and body motion, demonstrated through superior performance and novel applications. The code will be made public.

Abstract: Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public.

To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Padé neurons (Paons), a novel non-linear neuron model inspired by Padé approximants, offering stronger non-linearity, diversity, and layer efficiency. Paons can replace any neuron model and show improved performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The McCulloch-Pitts neuron model and point-wise activations are limited in non-linearity. The paper aims to propose a better non-linear neuron model (Paons) to enhance neural network performance with fewer layers.

Method: Paons are inspired by Padé approximants, learning diverse non-linear functions per neuron. They replace classic neurons in ResNet-based models for tasks like image super-resolution, compression, and classification.

Result: Experiments show Paons provide equal or better performance than classic neurons with fewer layers, demonstrating their efficacy in various tasks.

Conclusion: Paons are a versatile and efficient neuron model, outperforming or matching traditional models while reducing layer complexity, validated by experiments and open-sourced code.

Abstract: Neural networks commonly employ the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, which is a linear model followed by a point-wise non-linear activation. Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Padé neurons (Paons), inspired by Padé approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Padé approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers. The PyTorch implementation code for Paon is open-sourced at https://github.com/onur-keles/Paon.

Conclusion: REACT complements existing reward models and improves generative video quality assessment.

Abstract: Recent advances in video reward models and post-training strategies have improved text-to-video (T2V) generation. While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.

*Raül Pérez-Gonzalo,Riccardo Magro,Andreas Espersen,Antonio Agudo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient method for segmenting wind turbine blades from visual data using unsupervised region classification, reducing reliance on annotated datasets while achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating inspections of wind turbine blades is crucial for maintaining performance, but traditional dense segmentation models require extensive annotations, which limits scalability.

Method: The proposed approach transforms pixel-level segmentation into binary region classification using unsupervised Modular Adaptive Region Growing, Adaptive Thresholding, and Region Merging. RegionMix augmentation enhances robustness.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong generalization across different windfarms.

Conclusion: The method offers an annotation-efficient solution for accurate turbine blade segmentation, addressing scalability challenges in traditional deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Reliable operation of wind turbines requires frequent inspections, as even minor surface damages can degrade aerodynamic performance, reduce energy output, and accelerate blade wear. Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms.

*Zitong Huang,Kaidong Zhang,Yukang Ding,Chao Gao,Rui Ding,Ying Chen,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LocalDPO is a post-training framework aligning text-to-video models with human preferences by optimizing spatio-temporal regions, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning text-to-video models with human preferences is key for high-quality video generation. Current DPO methods are inefficient and provide ambiguous supervision.

Method: LocalDPO uses localized preference pairs from real videos, automating data collection without external critics or manual effort. It corrupts positive samples with random masks and trains with a region-aware DPO loss.

Result: LocalDPO improves video fidelity, coherence, and human preference scores on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX benchmarks.

Conclusion: LocalDPO offers a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for aligning video generators with human preferences.

Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.

*Zhihao Zhu,Jiafeng Liang,Shixin Jiang,Jinlan Fu,Ming Liu,Guanglu Sun,See-Kiong Ng,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper exposes a flaw called 'textual inertia' in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), where errors propagate unchecked due to reliance on faulty text over visual cues. It introduces a protocol to test self-correction and proposes a solution to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unreliability of reasoning chains in LMMs, particularly their tendency to ignore visual evidence once textual errors occur.

Method: The authors use the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol to test models' self-reflection and propose Active Visual-Context Refinement to mitigate errors.

Result: Models self-corrected in under 10% of cases; the proposed method significantly reduced error propagation.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a critical flaw in LMM reasoning and offers an effective, training-free solution to enhance robustness.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between reconstruction and generative models for improved 3D scene generation.

Method: Uses an adapter on VGGT reconstruction tokens to align with video diffusion model latents, generating disentangled yet aligned outputs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in single- and multi-image 3D scene generation and enhances reconstruction robustness.

Conclusion: Coupling reconstruction and generative models mutually benefits both, advancing 3D generation capabilities.

Abstract: We present Gen3R, a method that bridges the strong priors of foundational reconstruction models and video diffusion models for scene-level 3D generation. We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation. Additionally, our method can enhance the robustness of reconstruction by leveraging generative priors, demonstrating the mutual benefit of tightly coupling reconstruction and generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoReason improves RS-VLMs by aligning internal reasoning with decisions through a logic-driven dataset and two-stage training, enhancing reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RS-VLMs exhibit logical hallucinations, leading to unreliable spatial decision-making. GeoReason aims to synchronize reasoning with outcomes.

Method: GeoReason-Bench dataset with 4,000 reasoning trajectories and two-stage training (Supervised Knowledge Initialization and Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning).

Result: Significant improvement in cognitive reliability and interpretability, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: GeoReason successfully addresses logical hallucinations, enhancing RS-VLM reliability through structured reasoning and training.

Abstract: The evolution of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models(RS-VLMs) emphasizes the importance of transitioning from perception-centric recognition toward high-level deductive reasoning to enhance cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks. However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal approach using pixel-wise 2D representations and contrastive learning improves feature extraction from satellite image time series (SITS) and remote sensing imagery (RSI), outperforming SOTA methods in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellites generate vast data, but existing deep learning models process entire images or time series, lacking effective pixel-wise feature extraction.

Method: Proposes recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series and introduces PIMC, a multimodal self-supervision approach combining 2D pixel time series representations and RSI.

Result: 2D representations enhance SITS feature extraction; contrastive learning improves representations for both pixel time series and RSI, outperforming SOTA methods in tasks like pixel-level forecasting and land cover classification.

Conclusion: The multimodal method is a robust self-supervision framework for SITS and RSI, demonstrating superior performance in Earth observation tasks.

Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Klear introduces a unified model architecture, progressive training, and a large-scale dataset to address audio-video joint generation challenges, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing issues like audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation in non-commercial approaches.

Method: Uses a single-tower DiT design with Omni-Full Attention, progressive multitask training, and a novel data-construction pipeline for high-quality datasets.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity, temporally aligned generation, outperforming prior methods and matching Veo 3 performance.

Conclusion: Klear offers a scalable, unified solution for next-generation audio-video synthesis.

Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-DRF introduces a differentiable reward flow using a frozen VLM to improve Text-to-Video generation, avoiding reliance on non-differentiable signals and mitigating issues like reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DPO methods for T2V generation depend on non-differentiable preference signals, leading to label-intensive training, bias, and instability. Diffusion-DRF aims to address these challenges.

Method: Uses a frozen VLM as a training-free critic to backpropagate feedback through the diffusion chain, converting VLM logits into gradients. Includes automated aspect-structured prompting and gradient checkpointing.

Result: Improves video quality and semantic alignment while avoiding reward hacking and collapse, without needing additional reward models or preference datasets.

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRF is model-agnostic, efficient, and generalizable to other diffusion-based tasks, offering a robust alternative to traditional preference optimization methods.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently improved Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by enhancing visual fidelity and text alignment. However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.

*Vladimir Frants,Sos Agaian,Karen Panetta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToTMNet introduces a lightweight rPPG architecture using FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing, achieving strong heart-rate accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep models for rPPG increase computational cost and parameter count, and temporal attention scales poorly with time. ToTMNet aims to address these issues.

Method: The paper proposes ToTMNet, replacing temporal attention with Toeplitz temporal mixing, using FFT for efficiency. It combines local depthwise convolution with gated global Toeplitz mixing.

Result: Achieves 1.055 bpm MAE on UBFC-rPPG and 1.582 bpm MAE in synthetic-to-real transfer, with high Pearson correlation (0.996 and 0.994).

Conclusion: ToTMNet's Toeplitz-structured mixing is efficient and practical for rPPG, though limited by dataset diversity.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimates a blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform from facial videos captured by commodity cameras. Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing 2D image-based (limited geometric reasoning) and 3D structure-based (difficult to update) visual localization methods.

Method: Augments 2D images with estimated depth maps and uses dense matchers for improved geometric accuracy. Features compact compression and GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC.

Result: Achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions and outperforms other memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

Conclusion: The hybrid representation balances ease of use, accuracy, and efficiency, setting a new benchmark in visual localization.

Abstract: Existing visual localization methods are typically either 2D image-based, which are easy to build and maintain but limited in effective geometric reasoning, or 3D structure-based, which achieve high accuracy but require a centralized reconstruction and are difficult to update. In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHORD, a universal generative pipeline for synthesizing dynamic 4D scenes by leveraging Lagrangian motion information from 2D videos, offering scalability and versatility compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating 4D dynamics are either labor-intensive (rule-based) or require large datasets (learning-based), lacking universality. CHORD addresses this gap by distilling motion from 2D videos.

Method: CHORD proposes a distillation-based pipeline to extract Lagrangian motion information from Eulerian representations in 2D videos, enabling category-agnostic and scalable synthesis of 4D dynamics.

Result: Experiments show CHORD's success in generating diverse multi-body 4D dynamics and its superiority over existing methods, including applications in robotics manipulation policies.

Conclusion: CHORD is a versatile, universal, and category-agnostic solution for synthesizing dynamic scenes, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Dynamic objects in our physical 4D (3D + time) world are constantly evolving, deforming, and interacting with other objects, leading to diverse 4D scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

Motivation: The paper identifies the retrieval-utilization gap, where models struggle to utilize retrieved evidence due to context blindness in noisy environments.

Method: Proposes DeepResearch-Slice, a neuro-symbolic framework that predicts span indices for hard filtering before reasoning.

Result: Achieves a 73% relative improvement (19.1% to 33.0%) on frozen backbones across six benchmarks, mitigating noise effectively.

Conclusion: Highlights the necessity of explicit grounding mechanisms in open-ended research.

Abstract: Deep Research agents predominantly optimize search policies to maximize retrieval probability. However, we identify a critical bottleneck: the retrieval-utilization gap, where models fail to use gold evidence even after it is retrieved, due to context blindness in noisy environments. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResearch-Slice, a simple yet effective neuro-symbolic framework. Unlike implicit attention, our approach predicts precise span indices to perform a deterministic hard filter before reasoning. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show substantial robustness gains. Applying our method to frozen backbones yields a 73 percent relative improvement, from 19.1 percent to 33.0 percent, effectively mitigating noise without requiring parameter updates to the reasoning model. These results highlight the need for explicit grounding mechanisms in open-ended research.

Conclusion: Jailbreak-Zero offers a scalable, comprehensive solution for identifying and mitigating LLM safety vulnerabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces Jailbreak-Zero, a novel red teaming methodology that shifts the paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM) safety evaluation from a constrained example-based approach to a more expansive and effective policy-based framework. By leveraging an attack LLM to generate a high volume of diverse adversarial prompts and then fine-tuning this attack model with a preference dataset, Jailbreak-Zero achieves Pareto optimality across the crucial objectives of policy coverage, attack strategy diversity, and prompt fidelity to real user inputs. The empirical evidence demonstrates the superiority of this method, showcasing significantly higher attack success rates against both open-source and proprietary models like GPT-40 and Claude 3.5 when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, Jailbreak-Zero accomplishes this while producing human-readable and effective adversarial prompts with minimal need for human intervention, thereby presenting a more scalable and comprehensive solution for identifying and mitigating the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks on-device LLMs (gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b) in clinical tasks, showing performance comparable to larger proprietary and open-source models, with fine-tuning further improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and infrastructure concerns with proprietary LLMs in clinical settings by evaluating smaller, on-device open-source alternatives.

Method: Benchmarked on-device LLMs across three clinical tasks, compared to proprietary (GPT-5, o4-mini) and open-source (DeepSeek-R1) models, and fine-tuned gpt-oss-20b on diagnostic data.

Result: On-device models matched or exceeded DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite smaller size; fine-tuning improved gpt-oss-20b's accuracy to near-GPT-5 levels.

Conclusion: On-device LLMs offer accurate, adaptable, privacy-preserving clinical support, facilitating broader integration into practice.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in clinical decision-making, yet the deployment of proprietary systems is hindered by privacy concerns and reliance on cloud-based infrastructure. Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5. These findings highlight the potential of on-device LLMs to deliver accurate, adaptable, and privacy-preserving clinical decision support, offering a practical pathway for broader integration of LLMs into routine clinical practice.

TL;DR: GPT-5 is a unified system combining smart, fast, and deeper reasoning models, with a real-time router for optimal model selection. It improves on benchmarks, reduces hallucinations, enhances safety, and excels in writing, coding, and health.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more versatile and effective AI system that outperforms predecessors, addresses real-world queries better, and ensures safety and reliability.

Method: GPT-5 integrates multiple specialized models managed by a continuously trained router, with advancements in safety training and performance optimization.

Result: GPT-5 surpasses previous models in benchmarks, reduces hallucinations, improves instruction following, and minimizes sycophancy, excelling in common use cases like writing, coding, and health.

Conclusion: GPT-5 represents a significant advancement in AI, offering improved performance, safety, and utility, with precautionary safeguards in high-risk domains.

Abstract: This is the system card published alongside the OpenAI GPT-5 launch, August 2025.
  GPT-5 is a unified system with a smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.
  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.
  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.

TL;DR: The paper challenges the current evaluation metrics for Small Language Models (SLMs) by proposing a new framework focused on non-reasoning tasks like tone modification, highlighting their industrial applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations favor Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks, overlooking SLMs’ strengths in practical, non-reasoning applications.

Method: Introduces a framework using data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation to assess SLMs in tasks lacking predefined datasets.

Result: Demonstrates SLMs’ effectiveness in tasks like tone modification, showing their potential despite lower scores in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Provides tools for benchmarking SLMs and LLMs in practical scenarios, emphasizing SLMs’ value in edge and private computing.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted language model evaluation toward reasoning and problem-solving tasks as measures of general intelligence. Small Language Models (SLMs) -- defined here as models under 10B parameters -- typically score 3-4 times lower than LLMs on these metrics. However, we demonstrate that these evaluations fail to capture SLMs' effectiveness in common industrial applications, such as tone modification tasks (e.g., funny, serious, professional). We propose an evaluation framework specifically designed to highlight SLMs' capabilities in non-reasoning tasks where predefined evaluation datasets don't exist. Our framework combines novel approaches in data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation to demonstrate the potential of task-specific finetuning. This work provides practitioners with tools to effectively benchmark both SLMs and LLMs for practical applications, particularly in edge and private computing scenarios. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/wraval.

Conclusion: The work offers insights for enterprises deploying LLMs and sets benchmarks for instruction-following capabilities, emphasizing the need for models better suited to enterprise precision.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, yet their deployment in enterprise environments reveals a critical limitation: inconsistent adherence to custom instructions. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of 13 leading LLMs across instruction compliance, response accuracy, and performance metrics in realworld RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) scenarios. Through systematic testing with samples and enterprise-grade evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that instruction following varies dramatically across models, with Claude-Sonnet-4 and GPT-5 achieving the highest results. Our findings reveal the "instruction gap" - a fundamental challenge where models excel at general tasks but struggle with precise instruction adherence required for enterprise deployment. This work provides practical insights for organizations deploying LLM-powered solutions and establishes benchmarks for instruction-following capabilities across major model families.

*Wentang Song,Jinqiang Li,Kele Huang,Junhui Lin,Shengxiang Wu,Zhongshi Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A history-free test set compression framework for LLMs is proposed to reduce semantic redundancy and computational costs without needing prior model performance data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized evaluation benchmarks for LLMs often have semantic redundancy and high computational costs, and existing compression methods rely on historical model data, making them unsuitable for cold-start scenarios.

Method: The framework fine-tunes a base LLM on domain-specific data, generates semantic embeddings, performs task-aware clustering, and uses a dataset X-ray mechanism to calibrate compression intensity.

Result: Experiments show the method reduces evaluation cost by over 90% while maintaining high fidelity to the full benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently compresses test sets in cold-start scenarios, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vertical domains has spurred the development of numerous specialized evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.
  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.
  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GuardEval is a benchmark dataset addressing nuanced moderation challenges in LLMs, and GGuard, a fine-tuned model, outperforms existing solutions in content moderation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for safer moderation systems in LLMs due to struggles with nuanced cases like implicit biases and ethical inconsistencies.

Method: Introduction of GuardEval, a multi-perspective benchmark dataset, and GGuard, a QLoRA fine-tuned model trained on GuardEval.

Result: GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, outperforming OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61).

Conclusion: Multi-perspective benchmarks and diverse data improve moderation fairness and robustness.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in daily life, the urgent need for safer moderation systems, distinguishing between naive from harmful requests while upholding appropriate censorship boundaries, has never been greater. While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods rely on semantic similarity between sentences but lack the long-range dependencies and extensive knowledge of LLMs. This gap motivates the use of LLMs for more effective topic segmentation.

Method: The proposed method involves an overlapping and recursive prompting strategy using sentence enumeration. It also introduces the boundary similarity evaluation metric.

Result: Results indicate that LLMs outperform existing methods for topic segmentation, highlighting their potential as effective segmenters.

Conclusion: While LLMs demonstrate improved performance for topic segmentation, unresolved issues suggest further research is needed before they can be fully relied upon for this task.

Abstract: Topic segmentation using generative Large Language Models (LLMs) remains relatively unexplored. Previous methods use semantic similarity between sentences, but such models lack the long range dependencies and vast knowledge found in LLMs. In this work, we propose an overlapping and recursive prompting strategy using sentence enumeration. We also support the adoption of the boundary similarity evaluation metric. Results show that LLMs can be more effective segmenters than existing methods, but issues remain to be solved before they can be relied upon for topic segmentation.

*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel 'Virtual Tensor Core' architecture optimized for ARM64 addresses the 'Memory Wall' bottleneck in LLM deployment by using direct memory mapping and NEON SIMD kernels, achieving stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of LLMs on edge devices is constrained by the 'Memory Wall,' caused by data movement latency exceeding arithmetic throughput. The work aims to overcome this bottleneck without proprietary dependencies.

Method: Implemented a software-based 'Virtual Tensor Core' architecture for ARM64 (Apple Silicon), using direct memory mapping (mmap) and hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels. Introduced Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) for 100% cache line utilization and a zero-copy loader.

Result: Achieved stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware with a 110M parameter model, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold.

Conclusion: The architecture provides an open, portable, and deterministic solution for studying memory bottlenecks on ARM silicon, outperforming standard inference runtimes.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.

*David S. Berman,Alexander G. Stapleton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how BPE tokenization transforms corpus statistics, driving token frequencies toward Zipf's law and affecting entropy patterns, ultimately clarifying BPE's role as both a compression and statistical transform mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between statistical properties of natural language (like Zipf's and Heaps' laws) and modern tokenization schemes (specifically BPE) used in transformer models.

Method: Analyze information content (Shannon entropy) of corpora under Zipfian distribution, derive closed-form expressions, and empirically study BPE's impact on token frequencies and entropy. Train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths.

Result: BPE drives token frequencies toward Zipf's law and induces specific entropy growth. Deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, aligning empirical distributions with weakly dependent regimes.

Conclusion: BPE acts as both a compressor and statistical transform, reconstructing key informational properties of natural language.

Abstract: Natural languages exhibit striking regularities in their statistical structure, including notably the emergence of Zipf's and Heaps' laws. Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.

TL;DR: Metaphors in training data strongly influence LLMs' reasoning and misalignment across domains, with interventions altering misalignment. Monitoring latent features enables accurate detection of misaligned content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if metaphors affect LLMs' reasoning pathways and contribute to emergent misalignment problems.

Method: Investigated metaphors' impact via interventions in pre-training, fine-tuning, and re-alignment phases, and analyzed latent feature activation.

Result: Found a causal relationship between metaphors and misalignment; designed a detector for predicting misaligned content.

Conclusion: Metaphors significantly influence LLMs' misalignment, and monitoring latent features can help mitigate cross-domain misalignment.

Abstract: Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.

*Maan Qraitem,Kate Saenko,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaWeaver introduces a framework to diversify character generation by separating world-building and behavioral-building, addressing biases in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing character generation methods exhibit alignment-induced biases like positive moral bias and helpful assistant bias, leading to predictable characters lacking dramatic tension.

Method: PersonaWeaver disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles) to create diverse characters.

Result: The framework produces characters with varied reactions, moral stances, and stylistic markers like tone and punctuation.

Conclusion: PersonaWeaver enhances character diversity, overcoming limitations of current alignment-focused methods.

Abstract: Procedural content generation has enabled vast virtual worlds through levels, maps, and quests, but large-scale character generation remains underexplored. We identify two alignment-induced biases in existing methods: a positive moral bias, where characters uniformly adopt agreeable stances (e.g. always saying lying is bad), and a helpful assistant bias, where characters invariably answer questions directly (e.g. never refusing or deflecting). While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about unauthorized use of protected data in LLM training by creating a practical black-box defense.

Method: Injecting disclaimers into text to exploit LLMs' alignment mechanisms, preventing effective learning.

Result: Fine-tuning on protected data activates alignment layers, degrading performance systematically.

Conclusion: Alignment behavior can be leveraged for data protection, offering a scalable method without modifying training pipelines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive, heterogeneous text corpora, raising serious concerns about the unauthorised use of proprietary or personal data during model training. In this work, we address the problem of data protection against unwanted model learning in a realistic black-box setting. We propose Disclaimer Injection, a novel data-level defence that renders text unlearnable to LLMs. Rather than relying on model-side controls or explicit data removal, our approach exploits the models' own alignment mechanisms: by injecting carefully designed alignment-triggering disclaimers to prevent effective learning. Through layer-wise analysis, we find that fine-tuning on such protected data induces persistent activation of alignment-related layers, causing alignment constraints to override task learning even on common inputs. Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning. Our results identify alignment behaviour as a previously unexplored lever for data protection and, to our knowledge, present the first practical method for restricting data learnability at LLM scale without requiring access to or modification of the training pipeline.

Abstract: We present a systematic formalization of Tigrinya cardinal and ordinal number verbalization, addressing a gap in computational resources for the language. This work documents the canonical rules governing the expression of numerical values in spoken Tigrinya, including the conjunction system, scale words, and special cases for dates, times, and currency. We provide a formal algorithm for number-to-word conversion and release an open-source implementation. Evaluation of frontier large language models (LLMs) reveals significant gaps in their ability to accurately verbalize Tigrinya numbers, underscoring the need for explicit rule documentation. This work serves language modeling, speech synthesis, and accessibility applications targeting Tigrinya-speaking communities.

*Xin Zhang,Kailai Yang,Hao Li,Chenyue Li,Qiyu Wei,Sophia Ananiadou*

TL;DR: LatentGraphMem is a memory framework combining implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval, improving long-context question-answering by balancing efficiency, stability, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of sparse and dispersed evidence in long contexts, LatentGraphMem aims to overcome limitations of existing memory paradigms by combining their strengths.

Method: The framework uses a latent graph-structured memory for stability and efficiency, with task-specific subgraph retrieval for downstream reasoning. Training involves materializing an explicit graph view, while inference retrieves subgraphs in latent space.

Result: Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks show LatentGraphMem outperforms explicit-graph and latent-memory baselines, enabling efficient adaptation and scaling.

Conclusion: LatentGraphMem offers a robust solution for long-context tasks, balancing efficiency, stability, and interpretability while supporting scalable reasoning.

Abstract: Long-horizon applications increasingly require large language models (LLMs) to answer queries when relevant evidence is sparse and dispersed across very long contexts. Existing memory systems largely follow two paradigms: explicit structured memories offer interpretability but often become brittle under long-context overload, while latent memory mechanisms are efficient and stable yet difficult to inspect. We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection. During training, an explicit graph view is materialized to interface with a frozen reasoner for question-answering supervision. At inference time, retrieval is performed in latent space and only the retrieved subgraph is externalized. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks across multiple model scales show that LatentGraphMem consistently outperforms representative explicit-graph and latent-memory baselines, while enabling parameter-efficient adaptation and flexible scaling to larger reasoners without introducing large symbolic artifacts.

TL;DR: PCoA is a benchmark for medical summarization with phrase-level context attribution, validated through experiments showing its reliability and the benefits of pre-identifying relevant content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective verification of system-generated summaries requires precise attribution to source context, especially in high-stakes medical domains.

Method: Introduces PCoA, an expert-annotated benchmark with phrase-level context attribution, and a decoupled evaluation framework assessing summaries, citations, and contributory phrases separately.

Result: Experiments validate PCoA's reliability and show that pre-identifying relevant sentences and phrases improves summary quality.

Conclusion: PCoA is a robust benchmark for evaluating medical summaries with precise context attribution, and explicit identification of supporting content enhances summarization.

Abstract: Verifying system-generated summaries remains challenging, as effective verification requires precise attribution to the source context, which is especially crucial in high-stakes medical domains. To address this challenge, we introduce PCoA, an expert-annotated benchmark for medical aspect-based summarization with phrase-level context attribution. PCoA aligns each aspect-based summary with its supporting contextual sentences and contributory phrases within them. We further propose a fine-grained, decoupled evaluation framework that independently assesses the quality of generated summaries, citations, and contributory phrases. Through extensive experiments, we validate the quality and consistency of the PCoA dataset and benchmark several large language models on the proposed task. Experimental results demonstrate that PCoA provides a reliable benchmark for evaluating system-generated summaries with phrase-level context attribution. Furthermore, comparative experiments show that explicitly identifying relevant sentences and contributory phrases before summarization can improve overall quality.

TL;DR: CAPT enables training-free adaptation of general-domain models to clinical tasks using older clinical models, outperforming individual models and other ensembling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Avoid costly retraining for clinical domain adaptation by leveraging existing models.

Method: Cross-Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT) uses contrastive decoding to combine signals from general and clinical models without retraining.

Result: CAPT outperforms individual models and other ensembling approaches (+17.6% over UniTE, +41.4% over proxy tuning) and improves clinical specificity.

Conclusion: CAPT is effective for clinical domain adaptation without retraining, enhancing clinical relevance and accuracy.

Abstract: Adapting language models to the clinical domain through continued pretraining and fine-tuning requires costly retraining for each new model generation. We propose Cross-Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT), a model-ensembling approach that enables training-free adaptation of state-of-the-art general-domain models using existing clinical models. CAPT supports models with disjoint vocabularies, leveraging contrastive decoding to selectively inject clinically relevant signals while preserving the general-domain model's reasoning and fluency. On six clinical classification and text-generation tasks, CAPT with a new-generation general-domain model and an older-generation clinical model consistently outperforms both models individually and state-of-the-art ensembling approaches (average +17.6% over UniTE, +41.4% over proxy tuning across tasks). Through token-level analysis and physician case studies, we demonstrate that CAPT amplifies clinically actionable language, reduces context errors, and increases clinical specificity.

### [93] [The Critical Role of Aspects in Measuring Document Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03435)
*Eftekhar Hossain,Tarnika Hazra,Ahatesham Bhuiyan,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASPECTSIM is a framework for aspect-based document similarity, outperforming traditional holistic methods, especially when using GPT-4o, but struggles with smaller LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of traditional holistic document similarity by introducing an aspect-conditioned approach for better interpretability and accuracy.

Method: Developed ASPECTSIM and tested it with a 26K benchmark using GPT-4o and smaller LLMs, employing direct prompting and a two-stage refinement.

Result: GPT-4o achieved ≈80% higher human-machine agreement than holistic methods, while smaller LLMs improved by ≈140% with refinement but still lagged behind.

Conclusion: Explicitly accounting for aspects improves document similarity, but smaller LLMs need further development to match large models like GPT-4o.

Abstract: We introduce ASPECTSIM, a simple and interpretable framework that requires conditioning document similarity on an explicitly specified aspect, which is different from the traditional holistic approach in measuring document similarity. Experimenting with a newly constructed benchmark of 26K aspect-document pairs, we found that ASPECTSIM, when implemented with direct GPT-4o prompting, achieves substantially higher human-machine agreement ($\approx$80% higher) than the same for holistic similarity without explicit aspects. These findings underscore the importance of explicitly accounting for aspects when measuring document similarity and highlight the need to revise standard practice. Next, we conducted a large-scale meta-evaluation using 16 smaller open-source LLMs and 9 embedding models with a focus on making ASPECTSIM accessible and reproducible. While directly prompting LLMs to produce ASPECTSIM scores turned out be ineffective (20-30% human-machine agreement), a simple two-stage refinement improved their agreement by $\approx$140%. Nevertheless, agreement remains well below that of GPT-4o-based models, indicating that smaller open-source LLMs still lag behind large proprietary models in capturing aspect-conditioned similarity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM judges lack consistency in scoring due to grading scale effects, with human-LLM alignment strongest on a 0-5 scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of grading scales on LLM-as-a-judge consistency and human-LLM agreement, addressing underexplored scale effects.

Method: Compare human and LLM ratings across three scales and six benchmarks (objective, subjective, mixed tasks), using ICC for agreement measurement.

Result: LLM judgments vary across scales on subjective tasks; human-LLM agreement shifts with scale choice, with 0-5 scale showing strongest alignment.

Conclusion: Scale design and sub-level diagnostics are crucial for LLM-as-a-judge protocols, as pooled reliability can mask heterogeneity and subgroup differences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, yet prior works demonstrate that these LLM judges often lack consistency in scoring when the prompt is altered. However, the effect of the grading scale itself remains underexplored. We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.

TL;DR: The paper introduces L2T, a pre-training framework that combines traditional next-token prediction with structured language learning tasks to improve linguistic competence in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models focus on world knowledge and reasoning but lack explicit optimization for linguistic competence. The authors aim to bridge this gap by incorporating structured language learning tasks inspired by human language acquisition.

Method: The proposed L2T framework transforms raw text into structured input-output pairs to provide explicit linguistic stimulation. It pre-trains models on a mix of raw text and L2T data alongside standard next-token prediction.

Result: L2T improves performance on linguistic competence benchmarks and accelerates the acquisition of linguistic skills, while maintaining competitive performance on general reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating structured language learning tasks into pre-training enhances linguistic competence without compromising general reasoning capabilities in language models.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are pre-trained on raw text datasets to generate text sequences token-by-token. While this approach facilitates the learning of world knowledge and reasoning, it does not explicitly optimize for linguistic competence. To bridge this gap, we propose L2T, a pre-training framework integrating Language Learning Tasks alongside standard next-token prediction. Inspired by human language acquisition, L2T transforms raw text into structured input-output pairs to provide explicit linguistic stimulation. Pre-training LMs on a mixture of raw text and L2T data not only improves overall performance on linguistic competence benchmarks but accelerates its acquisition, while maintaining competitive performance on general reasoning tasks.

*Dan Schumacher,Erfan Nourbakhsh,Rocky Slavin,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform poorly in prompt-based time series classification, but direct probing shows they encode meaningful temporal structure, outperforming specialized models in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify whether LLMs truly lack understanding of time series, or if prompt-based evaluations fail to reveal their actual capabilities.

Method: Linear probes are used to analyze internal representations of LLMs, comparing results with prompt-based evaluations. Layer-wise analyses and multimodal inputs are also examined.

Result: Linear probes significantly improve classification performance (F1: 0.15–0.26 to 0.61–0.67), showing LLMs encode temporal structure better than prompt-based evaluations suggest.

Conclusion: Current evaluations underestimate LLMs' time series understanding due to a mismatch between internal representations and prompt-based outputs.

Abstract: Prompt-based evaluations suggest that large language models (LLMs) perform poorly on time series classification, raising doubts about whether they encode meaningful temporal structure. We show that this conclusion reflects limitations of prompt-based generation rather than the model's representational capacity by directly comparing prompt outputs with linear probes over the same internal representations. While zero-shot prompting performs near chance, linear probes improve average F1 from 0.15-0.26 to 0.61-0.67, often matching or exceeding specialized time series models. Layer-wise analyses further show that class-discriminative time series information emerges in early transformer layers and is amplified by visual and multimodal inputs. Together, these results demonstrate a systematic mismatch between what LLMs internally represent and what prompt-based evaluation reveals, leading current evaluations to underestimate their time series understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EpiQAL is the first benchmark for epidemiological question answering, evaluating factual recall, multi-step inference, and conclusion reconstruction, revealing limitations in current LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation for evidence-grounded epidemiological inference, which is crucial for reliable disease burden and intervention analysis.

Method: EpiQAL was constructed using expert-designed taxonomy, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control, with three subsets for different reasoning tasks.

Result: Current LLMs perform poorly on epidemiological reasoning, especially in multi-step inference. Chain-of-Thought helps but results vary, and model rankings differ across tasks.

Conclusion: EpiQAL offers fine-grained diagnostics for epidemiological reasoning, highlighting challenges for LLMs and the need for improved evidence grounding and inference capabilities.

Abstract: Reliable epidemiological reasoning requires synthesizing study evidence to infer disease burden, transmission dynamics, and intervention effects at the population level. Existing medical question answering benchmarks primarily emphasize clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning, yet few systematically evaluate evidence-grounded epidemiological inference. We present EpiQAL, the first diagnostic benchmark for epidemiological question answering across diverse diseases, comprising three subsets built from open-access literature. The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere. EpiQAL provides fine-grained diagnostic signals for evidence grounding, inferential reasoning, and conclusion reconstruction.

*José Isidro,Filipe Cunha,Purificação Silvano,Alípio Jorge,Nuno Guimarães,Sérgio Nunes,Ricardo Campos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SegNSP frames text segmentation as a next sentence prediction task, achieving strong results without topic labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text segmentation is challenging but crucial for NLP applications like summarization and QA. SegNSP aims to improve segmentation by leveraging sentence continuity.

Method: Label-agnostic NSP with segmentation-aware loss and harder negative sampling, avoiding explicit topic labels.

Result: Achieves B-F1 of 0.79 on CitiLink-Minutes and 0.65 on WikiSection, outperforming TopSeg by 0.17 points.

Conclusion: SegNSP effectively models sentence continuity, enhancing segmentation quality for NLP tasks.

Abstract: Linear text segmentation is a long-standing problem in natural language processing (NLP), focused on dividing continuous text into coherent and semantically meaningful units. Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points. These results demonstrate competitive and robust performance, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity for improving segmentation quality and supporting downstream NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CALM is a framework that enhances cultural awareness in language models by disentangling and structuring cultural concepts, enabling dynamic adaptation and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches treat culture statically, limiting reliability in culturally sensitive tasks. CALM aims to address this by incorporating dynamic cultural understanding.

Method: CALM disentangles cultural concepts, forms structured clusters via contrastive learning, aligns them with cross-attention, and integrates them adaptively using Mixture-of-Experts.

Result: CALM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on cross-cultural benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: CALM effectively integrates cultural awareness into language models, improving adaptability and performance in culturally sensitive tasks.

Abstract: Cultural awareness in language models is the capacity to understand and adapt to diverse cultural contexts. However, most existing approaches treat culture as static background knowledge, overlooking its dynamic and evolving nature. This limitation reduces their reliability in downstream tasks that demand genuine cultural sensitivity. In this work, we introduce CALM, a novel framework designed to endow language models with cultural self-awareness. CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple cross-cultural benchmark datasets demonstrate that CALM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: KR-Test is introduced to distinguish factual learning from stylistic mimicry in SFT by using contrastive examples, validated through baseline analysis and applied to analyze LoRA training dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like validation perplexity fail to differentiate between stylistic mimicry and factual learning in SFT for LLMs.

Method: Developed KR-Test uses contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct vs. incorrect continuations without instruction tuning or generative decoding.

Result: Validated KR-Test's integrity via baseline analysis and demonstrated its diagnostic utility in analyzing LoRA training dynamics.

Conclusion: KR-Test improves interpretability of fine-tuning dynamics by dissociating linguistic convergence from knowledge retention.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a standard approach for injecting domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, relying on validation perplexity to monitor training is often insufficient, as it confounds stylistic mimicry with genuine factual internalization. To address this, we introduce the Knowledge Retention (KR) Test , a lightweight, corpus-grounded evaluation framework designed to distinguish factual learning from linguistics. KR-Test utilizes automatically generated contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct versus incorrect continuations, requiring no instruction tuning or generative decoding. We validate the framework's integrity through a "blind vs. oracle" baseline analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities of KR-Test by analyzing the training dynamics of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). By exposing the fine-grained dissociation between linguistic convergence and knowledge retention, KR-Test enhances the interpretability of fine-tuning dynamics.

TL;DR: RPAM merges Long-CoT and Short-CoT models for efficient reasoning, reducing inference cost without retraining or complex prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often generate lengthy reasoning paths unnecessarily, increasing computation and latency. Existing speed-up methods are costly or sensitive to input/prompts.

Method: Proposes RPAM, a layer-wise merging framework using feature alignment. It creates a calibration set for query-adaptive reasoning and optimizes merging coefficients via contrastive alignment.

Result: RPAM significantly cuts inference cost while maintaining strong performance across seven reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: RPAM offers a lightweight, efficient alternative for adaptive reasoning without retraining or large additional data, with plans to open-source the code.

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have made substantial progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they often generate lengthy reasoning paths for every query, incurring unnecessary computation and latency. Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM.

TL;DR: IntroLM is a method enabling LLMs to predict their own output quality during prefilling using introspective tokens, outperforming external classifiers and improving efficiency in multi-model routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of external classifiers (e.g., BERT-based models) for predicting LLM output quality, such as limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and computational overhead.

Method: Introduces token conditional LoRA, which activates only for introspective tokens, allowing LLMs to predict output quality without affecting generation or requiring external evaluators.

Result: IntroLM achieves a 90% ROC AUC for success prediction (14% better than DeBERTa) and improves multi-model routing, reducing latency by 33% and large model usage by 50% at matched reliability.

Conclusion: IntroLM offers a scalable and efficient solution for LLM output quality prediction, outperforming traditional classifiers and enhancing system performance.

Abstract: A major challenge for the operation of large language models (LLMs) is how to predict whether a specific LLM will produce sufficiently high-quality output for a given query. Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to assess multimodal memory preservation and evolution in long-term conversations, necessitating a new evaluation framework.

Method: Mem-Gallery is introduced, featuring multi-session conversations grounded in visual and textual information. A systematic evaluation framework assesses memory extraction, reasoning, and knowledge management.

Result: Extensive benchmarking on thirteen systems reveals the need for explicit memory retention and organization, persistent limitations in reasoning and knowledge management, and efficiency bottlenecks.

Conclusion: Mem-Gallery provides a crucial benchmark for advancing multimodal long-term memory capabilities in MLLM agents, highlighting current challenges.

Abstract: Long-term memory is a critical capability for multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, particularly in conversational settings where information accumulates and evolves over time. However, existing benchmarks either evaluate multi-session memory in text-only conversations or assess multimodal understanding within localized contexts, failing to evaluate how multimodal memory is preserved, organized, and evolved across long-term conversational trajectories. Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management. Extensive benchmarking across thirteen memory systems reveals several key findings, highlighting the necessity of explicit multimodal information retention and memory organization, the persistent limitations in memory reasoning and knowledge management, as well as the efficiency bottleneck of current models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LALMs perform well generically but fail in personalized tasks like answering questions based on individual context. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The authors formalize PALMs for personal concept recognition and reasoning, create PALM-Bench for evaluation, and test existing LALMs using prompting and fine-tuning strategies.

Result: Experiments show that existing methods improve but still struggle with personalized knowledge and robust task transfer.

Conclusion: Personalized LALMs are necessary to address gaps in current models, and PALM-Bench provides a tool for future advancements.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated strong performance in audio understanding and generation. Yet, our extensive benchmarking reveals that their behavior is largely generic (e.g., summarizing spoken content) and fails to adequately support personalized question answering (e.g., summarizing what my best friend says). In contrast, human conditions their interpretation and decision-making on each individual's personal context. To bridge this gap, we formalize the task of Personalized LALMs (PALM) for recognizing personal concepts and reasoning within personal context. Moreover, we create the first benchmark (PALM-Bench) to foster the methodological advances in PALM and enable structured evaluation on several tasks across multi-speaker scenarios. Our extensive experiments on representative open-source LALMs, show that existing training-free prompting and supervised fine-tuning strategies, while yield improvements, remains limited in modeling personalized knowledge and transferring them across tasks robustly. Data and code will be released.

Motivation: Existing bikeability assessments struggle with road environment complexity and subjective user perception heterogeneity. The study aims to enhance these methods by integrating user-specific insights and explainable AI.

Method: The framework combines theory-grounded persona conditioning, multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning, and AI-enabled data augmentation. It uses a crowdsourced system to collect 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments.

Conclusion: The proposed persona-aware model effectively addresses key limitations in bikeability assessment, offering both accurate predictions and interpretable insights for cyclist-friendly urban planning.

Abstract: Bikeability assessment is essential for advancing sustainable urban transportation and creating cyclist-friendly cities, and it requires incorporating users' perceptions of safety and comfort. Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepSynth-Eval, a benchmark to objectively evaluate LLMs' post-retrieval synthesis capabilities, using survey papers as gold standards and proposing checklists for factual and structural evaluation. Results show multi-step workflows outperform single-turn generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack objective evaluation for the post-retrieval synthesis stage of LLMs due to the subjectivity of open-ended writing.

Method: Developed DeepSynth-Eval using survey papers as gold standards, reverse-engineering research requests, and proposing checklists (General and Constraint) for evaluation.

Result: Experiments showed synthesizing from many references is challenging, but agentic workflows reduce hallucinations and improve adherence to constraints.

Conclusion: DeepSynth-Eval provides a robust benchmark for evaluating synthesis capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-step workflows.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) towards autonomous agents has catalyzed progress in Deep Research. While retrieval capabilities are well-benchmarked, the post-retrieval synthesis stage--where agents must digest massive amounts of context and consolidate fragmented evidence into coherent, long-form reports--remains under-evaluated due to the subjectivity of open-ended writing. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSynth-Eval, a benchmark designed to objectively evaluate information consolidation capabilities. We leverage high-quality survey papers as gold standards, reverse-engineering research requests and constructing "Oracle Contexts" from their bibliographies to isolate synthesis from retrieval noise. We propose a fine-grained evaluation protocol using General Checklists (for factual coverage) and Constraint Checklists (for structural organization), transforming subjective judgment into verifiable metrics. Experiments across 96 tasks reveal that synthesizing information from hundreds of references remains a significant challenge. Our results demonstrate that agentic plan-and-write workflows significantly outperform single-turn generation, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving adherence to complex structural constraints.

*Xukai Liu,Ye Liu,Jipeng Zhang,Yanghai Zhang,Kai Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit layer-order inversion in multi-hop reasoning, where later-hop answers emerge earlier than bridge entities, challenging the hop-aligned circuit hypothesis. A probabilistic recall-and-extract framework explains this behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how LLMs internally compose multiple facts during multi-hop reasoning, challenging existing assumptions about sequential computation of bridge entities.

Method: The researchers analyze real-world multi-hop queries, propose the probabilistic recall-and-extract framework, and validate it through probing analyses and reinterpretation of prior evidence.

Result: The framework effectively explains layer-order inversion, chain-of-thought gains, and multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge.

Conclusion: The probabilistic recall-and-extract framework provides a mechanistic understanding of LLM multi-hop reasoning, highlighting discrepancies with the hop-aligned circuit hypothesis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on multi-hop reasoning, yet how they internally compose multiple facts remains unclear. Recent work proposes \emph{hop-aligned circuit hypothesis}, suggesting that bridge entities are computed sequentially across layers before later-hop answers. Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvolMem is a new benchmark for evaluating multi-session memory capabilities of LLMs and agents, grounded in cognitive psychology and using hybrid data synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of LLMs across diverse memory dimensions, especially in multi-session settings.

Method: EvolMem uses a hybrid data synthesis framework involving topic-initiated generation and narrative-inspired transformations to create multi-session conversations.

Result: No LLM consistently outperforms others across all memory dimensions, and agent memory mechanisms often show efficiency limitations.

Conclusion: EvolMem provides a comprehensive benchmark for multi-session memory evaluation, highlighting gaps in current LLM and agent capabilities.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in understanding and leveraging long-range conversational memory, existing benchmarks still lack systematic evaluation of large language models(LLMs) across diverse memory dimensions, particularly in multi-session settings. In this work, we propose EvolMem, a new benchmark for assessing multi-session memory capabilities of LLMs and agent systems. EvolMem is grounded in cognitive psychology and encompasses both declarative and non-declarative memory, further decomposed into multiple fine-grained abilities. To construct the benchmark, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that consists of topic-initiated generation and narrative-inspired transformations. This framework enables scalable generation of multi-session conversations with controllable complexity, accompanied by sample-specific evaluation guidelines. Extensive evaluation reveals that no LLM consistently outperforms others across all memory dimensions. Moreover, agent memory mechanisms do not necessarily enhance LLMs' capabilities and often exhibit notable efficiency limitations. Data and code will be released at https://github.com/shenye7436/EvolMem.

*Guanyu Chen,Chenxiao Yu,Xiyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a context-based assessment protocol to evaluate how LLMs' expressed values (privacy concerns and prosocialness) align with their data-sharing actions, using MGSEM and VAAR metrics. Findings show model-specific patterns and heterogeneity in alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs often isolate privacy attitudes or sharing intentions, lacking insights into how these values jointly predict actions, akin to human behavior.

Method: A context-based protocol administers standardized questionnaires for privacy, prosocialness, and data-sharing acceptance within bounded sessions. MGSEM evaluates value-action alignment, and VAAR aggregates path-level evidence.

Result: LLMs exhibit stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles and significant variability in value-action alignment.

Conclusion: The method successfully captures nuanced value-action relationships in LLMs, revealing model-specific behaviors and alignment heterogeneity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate decision-making tasks involving personal data sharing, where privacy concerns and prosocial motivations can push choices in opposite directions. Existing evaluations often measure privacy-related attitudes or sharing intentions in isolation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a model's expressed values jointly predict its downstream data-sharing actions as in real human behaviors. We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of LLMs in police operations lacks a tailored evaluation framework, risking severe issues like unlawful arrests and improper evidence collection.

Method: Proposed PAS framework, constructed a QA dataset from 8,000+ official documents, and established metrics validated by police experts.

Result: Commercial LLMs struggled with police-related tasks, especially fact-based recommendations.

Conclusion: An expandable evaluation framework is necessary for reliable AI-driven police operations; data and prompts are released.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in police operations is growing, yet an evaluation framework tailored to police operations remains absent. While LLM's responses may not always be legally incorrect, their unverified use still can lead to severe issues such as unlawful arrests and improper evidence collection. To address this, we propose PAS (Police Action Scenarios), a systematic framework covering the entire evaluation process. Applying this framework, we constructed a novel QA dataset from over 8,000 official documents and established key metrics validated through statistical analysis with police expert judgements. Experimental results show that commercial LLMs struggle with our new police-related tasks, particularly in providing fact-based recommendations. This study highlights the necessity of an expandable evaluation framework to ensure reliable AI-driven police operations. We release our data and prompt template.

TL;DR: DiffCoT proposes a diffusion-styled Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework to improve multi-step reasoning by enabling iterative correction of errors during decoding, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address exposure bias and error accumulation in CoT reasoning by leveraging diffusion principles for iterative correction.

Method: Introduces DiffCoT, integrating diffusion techniques via sliding-window and causal diffusion noise schedules for unified generation and correction.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on multi-step CoT benchmarks, improving robustness and error-correction capability.

Conclusion: DiffCoT enhances CoT reasoning by combining diffusion principles with autoregression, offering better error handling and consistency.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves multi-step mathematical problem solving in large language models but remains vulnerable to exposure bias and error accumulation, as early mistakes propagate irreversibly through autoregressive decoding. In this work, we propose DiffCoT, a diffusion-styled CoT framework that reformulates CoT reasoning as an iterative denoising process. DiffCoT integrates diffusion principles at the reasoning-step level via a sliding-window mechanism, enabling unified generation and retrospective correction of intermediate steps while preserving token-level autoregression. To maintain causal consistency, we further introduce a causal diffusion noise schedule that respects the temporal structure of reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on three multi-step CoT reasoning benchmarks across diverse model backbones demonstrate that DiffCoT consistently outperforms existing CoT preference optimization methods, yielding improved robustness and error-correction capability in CoT reasoning.

*Barry Menglong Yao,Sha Li,Yunzhi Yao,Minqian Liu,Zaishuo Xia,Qifan Wang,Lifu Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how LLMs learn, retain, and forget concepts during continual pretraining, linking these dynamics to internal 'Concept Circuits' and revealing patterns like interference, synergy, and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs acquire and manage concepts is crucial for improving their interpretability and robustness in concept-aware training.

Method: The study analyzes LLMs' internal Concept Circuits using Graph Metrics to track concept learning and forgetting during continual pretraining.

Result: Key findings include stage-wise learning patterns, interference effects among similar concepts, and varying transferability of conceptual knowledge.

Conclusion: The results provide insights into concept learning dynamics and inform better training strategies for LLMs.

Abstract: Human beings primarily understand the world through concepts (e.g., dog), abstract mental representations that structure perception, reasoning, and learning. However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PsychEthicsBench, a benchmark grounded in Australian psychology guidelines, to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavior in mental health applications. It highlights limitations of refusal-based metrics and shows domain-specific fine-tuning can reduce ethical robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating LLM safety in mental health rely too much on refusal signals, which lack nuance and can discourage help-seeking. A more comprehensive, principle-based framework is needed.

Method: The authors developed PsychEthicsBench, using Australian psychology guidelines to create multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with ethical annotations, testing 14 LLMs.

Result: Findings show refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, and domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, with specialized models underperforming base models.

Conclusion: PsychEthicsBench offers a systematic, jurisdiction-aware framework for evaluating LLMs in mental health, promoting responsible development.

Abstract: The increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into mental health applications necessitates robust frameworks for evaluating professional safety alignment. Current evaluative approaches primarily rely on refusal-based safety signals, which offer limited insight into the nuanced behaviors required in clinical practice. In mental health, clinically inadequate refusals can be perceived as unempathetic and discourage help-seeking. To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness. Notably, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, as several specialized models underperform their base backbones in ethical alignment. PsychEthicsBench provides a foundation for systematic, jurisdiction-aware evaluation of LLMs in mental health, encouraging more responsible development in this domain.

*Juhyun Oh,Haneul Yoo,Faiz Ghifari Haznitrama,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current LLMs struggle with aligning output language in code-switched interactions, often responding in undesired languages. OLA benchmark reveals bias toward non-English responses and instability. Simple alignment methods can improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching is common among multilingual users, but LLMs often fail to infer the correct output language, leading to misaligned responses.

Method: Introduced OLA benchmark for evaluating Output Language Alignment, focusing on Korean-English code-switching. Tested frontier models and explored Chain-of-Thought prompting and Code-Switching Aware DPO.

Result: Frontier models frequently misinterpret language expectations, showing bias toward non-English and instability. Code-Switching Aware DPO improves alignment with minimal data.

Conclusion: LLMs need better alignment with users' implicit language expectations in code-switched interactions. Simple alignment methods can address these issues.

Abstract: Code-switching, alternating between languages within a conversation, is natural for multilingual users, yet poses fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs). When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations. Our results highlight the need to align multilingual LLMs with users' implicit expectations in real-world code-switched interactions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework enabling LLMs to represent reasoning processes as structured graphs, improving consistency and performance in open-domain QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning is linear and inconsistent, whereas real-world reasoning requires parallel integration of premises. Existing methods like CoT lack structured reasoning, prompting the need for SGR.

Method: Proposed SGR allows LLMs to construct and use graph-structured reasoning. A graph-structured dataset merges candidate reasoning graphs for training.

Result: SGR improves reasoning consistency and achieves a 17.74% gain over base models. Fine-tuned LLaMA-3.3-70B matches GPT-4o and outperforms Claude-3.5-Haiku.

Conclusion: Graph-structured reasoning via SGR enhances LLM performance and consistency, proving effective across diverse QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in open-domain question answering, yet their reasoning processes are typically linear and often logically inconsistent. In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiVA, a hybrid framework combining generative and discriminative models for fine-grained factuality verification, outperforming existing methods on FGVeriBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current factuality verification lacks nuance by using binary judgments, limiting its application for fine-grained evaluation and preference optimization.

Method: Proposes DiVA, integrating agentic search from generative models with precise scoring from discriminative models, and introduces FGVeriBench as a benchmark.

Result: DiVA outperforms existing methods on FGVeriBench for general and multi-hop factuality verification.

Conclusion: DiVA addresses limitations in current verification methods, offering improved performance for fine-grained factuality assessment.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), their factuality remains a critical challenge, fueling growing interest in factuality verification. Existing research on factuality verification primarily conducts binary judgments (e.g., correct or incorrect), which fails to distinguish varying degrees of error severity. This limits its utility for applications such as fine-grained evaluation and preference optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Agentic Discriminative Verifier (DiVA), a hybrid framework that synergizes the agentic search capabilities of generative models with the precise scoring aptitude of discriminative models. We also construct a new benchmark, FGVeriBench, as a robust testbed for fine-grained factuality verification. Experimental results on FGVeriBench demonstrate that our DiVA significantly outperforms existing methods on factuality verification for both general and multi-hop questions.

*Binh Nguyen,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of Audio Language Models (ALMs) in audio deepfake detection by analyzing reasoning shifts under adversarial attacks, revealing that explicit reasoning does not universally improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of transparency in traditional black-box classifiers by exploring the robustness of ALMs' reasoning in forensic audio deepfake analysis.

Method: A forensic auditing framework is introduced to assess ALMs' reasoning robustness along three dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance under adversarial attacks.

Result: The analysis shows bifurcation: reasoning enhances robustness for models with strong acoustic perception but degrades performance under linguistic attacks for others. High cognitive dissonance can flag manipulation even when classification fails.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning in ALMs does not universally improve robustness; its impact varies. The study highlights the need to evaluate reasoning vulnerabilities in forensic audio deepfake detection.

Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) offer a promising shift towards explainable audio deepfake detections (ADDs), moving beyond \textit{black-box} classifiers by providing some level of transparency into their predictions via reasoning traces. This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks. However, for others, it imposes a performance \textit{``tax''}, particularly under linguistic attacks which reduce cognitive coherence and increase attack success rate. Crucially, even when classification fails, high cognitive dissonance can serve as a \textit{silent alarm}, flagging potential manipulation. Overall, this work provides a critical evaluation of the role of reasoning in forensic audio deepfake analysis and its vulnerabilities.

Motivation: To assess LLMs' diagnostic performance in clinical settings using guidelines and real-world applicability.

Method: Evaluates LLMs directly (HPI-guideline comparison) and indirectly (disease diagnosis), testing model size, HPI relevance, and language impact.

Result: Small task-specific models outperform frontier LLMs; HPI amount doesn't always improve diagnosis; language affects dialogue.

Conclusion: EPAG's open-source tools aim to advance LLM evaluation and development for clinical applications.

Abstract: We introduce EPAG, a benchmark dataset and framework designed for Evaluating the Pre-consultation Ability of LLMs using diagnostic Guidelines. LLMs are evaluated directly through HPI-diagnostic guideline comparison and indirectly through disease diagnosis. In our experiments, we observe that small open-source models fine-tuned with a well-curated, task-specific dataset can outperform frontier LLMs in pre-consultation. Additionally, we find that increased amount of HPI (History of Present Illness) does not necessarily lead to improved diagnostic performance. Further experiments reveal that the language of pre-consultation influences the characteristics of the dialogue. By open-sourcing our dataset and evaluation pipeline on https://github.com/seemdog/EPAG, we aim to contribute to the evaluation and further development of LLM applications in real-world clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine if LRMs outperform non-reasoning LLMs in judgment tasks and address the issue of biases in these models.

Method: Empirical analysis comparing LRMs and non-reasoning LLMs, followed by proposing PlanJudge, a strategy to mitigate biases by prompting explicit evaluation plans.

Result: 1) LRMs excel in judgment accuracy and instruction-following. 2) They are more robust against adversarial attacks. 3) Both model types show biases. 4) PlanJudge effectively reduces biases.

Conclusion: LRMs are superior to non-reasoning LLMs in key aspects but still suffer from biases. PlanJudge is a simple yet effective solution for bias mitigation.

Abstract: This paper presents the first systematic comparison investigating whether Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are superior judge to non-reasoning LLMs. Our empirical analysis yields four key findings: 1) LRMs outperform non-reasoning LLMs in terms of judgment accuracy, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks; 2) LRMs demonstrate superior instruction-following capabilities in evaluation contexts; 3) LRMs exhibit enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks targeting judgment tasks; 4) However, LRMs still exhibit strong biases in superficial quality. To improve the robustness against biases, we propose PlanJudge, an evaluation strategy that prompts the model to generate an explicit evaluation plan before execution. Despite its simplicity, our experiments demonstrate that PlanJudge significantly mitigates biases in both LRMs and standard LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-Dice is a parameter fusion framework addressing catastrophic forgetting in LLM-based agents by distinguishing and managing shared and conflicting knowledge updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The stability-plasticity dilemma in continual learning arises from failing to separate common knowledge from task-specific interference.

Method: Agent-Dice uses geometric consensus filtering and curvature-based importance weighting in a two-stage process to disentangle knowledge updates.

Result: Experiments show Agent-Dice excels in continual learning with low computational overhead and minimal parameter updates.

Conclusion: Agent-Dice effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting by explicitly managing knowledge updates, validated theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents significantly extend the utility of LLMs by interacting with dynamic environments. However, enabling agents to continually learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this work, we argue that this dilemma fundamentally arises from the failure to explicitly distinguish between common knowledge shared across tasks and conflicting knowledge introduced by task-specific interference. To address this, we propose Agent-Dice, a parameter fusion framework based on directional consensus evaluation. Concretely, Agent-Dice disentangles knowledge updates through a two-stage process: geometric consensus filtering to prune conflicting gradients, and curvature-based importance weighting to amplify shared semantics. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that establishes the validity of the proposed fusion scheme and offers insight into the origins of the stability-plasticity dilemma. Extensive experiments on GUI agents and tool-use agent domains demonstrate that Agent-Dice exhibits outstanding continual learning performance with minimal computational overhead and parameter updates.

TL;DR: LLM-MC-Affect is a probabilistic framework for analyzing emotional coordination in interactions, using stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation to capture sentiment dynamics and interpersonal coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of deterministic sentiment analysis by capturing the subjectivity, ambiguity, and sequential coupling in mutual exchanges.

Method: Leverages stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation to approximate continuous latent probability distributions of emotion, enabling sentiment trajectory analysis.

Result: Quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights, such as effective scaffolding in teacher-student dialogues.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable and generalizable solution for understanding interpersonal dynamics, applicable beyond education to broader social research.

Abstract: Emotional coordination is a core property of human interaction that shapes how relational meaning is constructed in real time. While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding. This work establishes a scalable and deployable pathway for understanding interpersonal dynamics, offering a generalizable solution that extends beyond education to broader social and behavioral research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELO method enhances continual pretraining for specific languages in multilingual models by optimizing critical layers, reducing computational costs, and preserving source language performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses high computational costs and performance degradation in traditional continual pretraining for multilingual models.

Method: Involves ELO Pretraining (training critical layers separately) and Layer Alignment (reintegration and fine-tuning).

Result: Achieves up to 6.46x training speedup, 6.2% performance improvement, and preserves English capabilities.

Conclusion: ELO is efficient and effective for multilingual model adaptation.

Abstract: We propose an efficient layer-specific optimization (ELO) method designed to enhance continual pretraining (CP) for specific languages in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). This approach addresses the common challenges of high computational cost and degradation of source language performance associated with traditional CP. The ELO method consists of two main stages: (1) ELO Pretraining, where a small subset of specific layers, identified in our experiments as the critically important first and last layers, are detached from the original MLLM and trained with the target language. This significantly reduces not only the number of trainable parameters but also the total parameters computed during the forward pass, minimizing GPU memory consumption and accelerating the training process. (2) Layer Alignment, where the newly trained layers are reintegrated into the original model, followed by a brief full fine-tuning step on a small dataset to align the parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELO method achieves a training speedup of up to 6.46 times compared to existing methods, while improving target language performance by up to 6.2\% on qualitative benchmarks and effectively preserving source language (English) capabilities.

*Haonan Chen,Sicheng Gao,Radu Timofte,Tetsuya Sakai,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe to address issues in omni-modal embedding models, improving cross-modal comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses problems like inconsistent similarity scores, ineffective in-batch negatives, and mismatched statistics in omni-modal embeddings derived from pretrained VLMs.

Method: The proposed e5-omni includes modality-aware temperature calibration, a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing, and batch whitening with covariance regularization.

Result: Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent improvements over existing baselines, and the method transfers well to other VLM backbones.

Conclusion: e5-omni effectively enhances the robustness of omni-modal embeddings, offering a scalable solution for cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: eTracer is a framework for traceable text generation in the biomedical domain, aligning claims with contextual evidence to improve verifiability and trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of verifying system-generated responses, especially in high-stakes domains like biomedicine.

Method: eTracer uses post-hoc grounding to align response claims with contextual evidence, enabling traceability and quantifying faithfulness.

Result: Experiments show improved grounding quality and user verification efficiency compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: eTracer enhances the verifiability and trustworthiness of generated responses through claim-level grounding.

Abstract: How can system-generated responses be efficiently verified, especially in the high-stakes biomedical domain? To address this challenge, we introduce eTracer, a plug-and-play framework that enables traceable text generation by grounding claims against contextual evidence. Through post-hoc grounding, each response claim is aligned with contextual evidence that either supports or contradicts it. Building on claim-level grounding results, eTracer not only enables users to precisely trace responses back to their contextual source but also quantifies response faithfulness, thereby enabling the verifiability and trustworthiness of generated responses. Experiments show that our claim-level grounding approach alleviates the limitations of conventional grounding methods in aligning generated statements with contextual sentence-level evidence, resulting in substantial improvements in overall grounding quality and user verification efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisastQA is a large-scale benchmark for QA in disaster management, featuring 3,000 verified questions across 8 disaster types. It evaluates models under diverse evidence conditions, revealing reliability gaps in noisy settings compared to clean benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA benchmarks lack realistic scenarios with uncertain or conflicting information, crucial for disaster management. DisastQA addresses this gap.

Method: The benchmark is created via human-LLM collaboration with stratified sampling. It includes 2,000 multiple-choice and 1,000 open-ended questions, evaluated under varying evidence conditions. Open-ended QA uses a keypoint-based evaluation protocol.

Result: Experiments with 20 models show performance diverges from general benchmarks like MMLU-Pro. Open-weight models perform well in clean settings but degrade under noise.

Conclusion: DisastQA highlights critical reliability gaps in QA models for disaster response, emphasizing the need for robustness in noisy, real-world conditions.

Abstract: Accurate question answering (QA) in disaster management requires reasoning over uncertain and conflicting information, a setting poorly captured by existing benchmarks built on clean evidence. We introduce DisastQA, a large-scale benchmark of 3,000 rigorously verified questions (2,000 multiple-choice and 1,000 open-ended) spanning eight disaster types. The benchmark is constructed via a human-LLM collaboration pipeline with stratified sampling to ensure balanced coverage. Models are evaluated under varying evidence conditions, from closed-book to noisy evidence integration, enabling separation of internal knowledge from reasoning under imperfect information. For open-ended QA, we propose a human-verified keypoint-based evaluation protocol emphasizing factual completeness over verbosity. Experiments with 20 models reveal substantial divergences from general-purpose leaderboards such as MMLU-Pro. While recent open-weight models approach proprietary systems in clean settings, performance degrades sharply under realistic noise, exposing critical reliability gaps for disaster response.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuronScope is a multi-agent framework that improves neuron interpretation in LLMs by iteratively deconstructing and refining semantic components, outperforming single-pass methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of polysemanticity in LLMs, where single-neuron interpretations fail to capture multiple semantic concepts.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework (NeuronScope) that deconstructs neuron activations into atomic semantic components, clusters them, and iteratively refines explanations using activation feedback.

Result: NeuronScope reveals hidden polysemanticity and achieves higher activation correlation than single-pass baselines.

Conclusion: Iterative, activation-guided interpretation methods like NeuronScope are more effective for understanding polysemantic neurons in LLMs.

Abstract: Neuron-level interpretation in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally challenged by widespread polysemanticity, where individual neurons respond to multiple distinct semantic concepts. Existing single-pass interpretation methods struggle to faithfully capture such multi-concept behavior. In this work, we propose NeuronScope, a multi-agent framework that reformulates neuron interpretation as an iterative, activation-guided process. NeuronScope explicitly deconstructs neuron activations into atomic semantic components, clusters them into distinct semantic modes, and iteratively refines each explanation using neuron activation feedback. Experiments demonstrate that NeuronScope uncovers hidden polysemanticity and produces explanations with significantly higher activation correlation compared to single-pass baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STEPS is a framework for generating compositionally challenging data to improve LLMs' and agent-based systems' generalization by organizing skills hierarchically and maximizing structural information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the data bottleneck causing poor compositional generalization in LLMs and agent-based systems.

Method: Developed STEPS, which constructs a hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory and synthesizes data via constrained information maximization.

Result: STEPS outperforms baselines in benchmarks and enhances compositional generalization in agent tasks.

Conclusion: STEPS effectively improves generalization by leveraging skill taxonomies and information theory.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based systems often struggle with compositional generalization due to a data bottleneck in which complex skill combinations follow a long-tailed, power-law distribution, limiting both instruction-following performance and generalization in agent-centric tasks. To address this challenge, we propose STEPS, a Skill Taxonomy guided Entropy-based Post-training data Synthesis framework for generating compositionally challenging data. STEPS explicitly targets compositional generalization by uncovering latent relationships among skills and organizing them into an interpretable, hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. Building on this taxonomy, we formulate data synthesis as a constrained information maximization problem, selecting skill combinations that maximize marginal structural information within the hierarchy while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments on challenging instruction-following benchmarks show that STEPS outperforms existing data synthesis baselines, while also yielding improved compositional generalization in downstream agent-based evaluations.

### [128] [From Implicit to Explicit: Token-Efficient Logical Supervision for Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03682)
*Shaojie Wang,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FSLR, a lightweight training framework, improves LLMs' logical reasoning by focusing on the first planning step, outperforming CoT-SFT in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack logical reasoning in math problems, relying too much on memorization. CoT-SFT fails to address logical errors, prompting the need for a better method.

Method: Proposed FSLR trains models on the first step (identifying variables and operations) to explicitly teach logical relationships, unlike CoT-SFT's implicit approach.

Result: FSLR outperforms CoT-SFT by 3.2% (in-distribution) and 4.6% (out-of-distribution), trains 4-6x faster, and reduces token use by 80%.

Conclusion: FSLR effectively enhances logical reasoning in LLMs with significant efficiency gains, addressing a key bottleneck in current methods.

Abstract: Recent studies reveal that large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited logical reasoning abilities in mathematical problem-solving, instead often relying on pattern-matching and memorization. We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\% and 4.6\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\%.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured framework for evaluating AI-generated stories, highlighting four components and eleven sub-components of creativity. Through controlled experiments and crowd-sourced studies, it shows that creativity is judged hierarchically and that reflective evaluation changes ratings, validating the framework's effectiveness over reference-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to capture creativity's subjective nature, necessitating a structured evaluation framework for AI story generation.

Method: The study uses "Spike Prompting" for controlled story generation and involves 115 readers to assess creativity through immediate and reflective judgments.

Result: Creativity is evaluated hierarchically, with reflective judgments altering ratings and inter-rater agreement. The framework effectively reveals obscured dimensions of creativity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of reference-based evaluation by capturing nuanced dimensions of creativity in AI-generated stories.

Abstract: Evaluating creative text generation remains a challenge because existing reference-based metrics fail to capture the subjective nature of creativity. We propose a structured evaluation framework for AI story generation comprising four components (Novelty, Value, Adherence, and Resonance) and eleven sub-components. Using controlled story generation via ``Spike Prompting'' and a crowdsourced study of 115 readers, we examine how different creative components shape both immediate and reflective human creativity judgments. Our findings show that creativity is evaluated hierarchically rather than cumulatively, with different dimensions becoming salient at different stages of judgment, and that reflective evaluation substantially alters both ratings and inter-rater agreement. Together, these results support the effectiveness of our framework in revealing dimensions of creativity that are obscured by reference-based evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADEPT introduces a dynamic early-exit mechanism for transformers, optimizing efficiency without sacrificing performance by adapting computations based on token complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing early-exit strategies are limited to specific phases or tokens, leaving the KV cache bottleneck unresolved. ADEPT aims to overcome these limitations for broader efficiency gains.

Method: ADEPT employs an adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism and decouples sequential dependencies in skipped layers to enhance KV generation.

Result: ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in generation tasks, achieves a 4x speed-up in classification tasks, and enhances performance by 45%.

Conclusion: ADEPT successfully addresses the KV cache bottleneck and enables dynamic early exit, significantly boosting efficiency and performance.

Abstract: The inference of large language models imposes significant computational workloads, often requiring the processing of billions of parameters. Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSeek-OCR's performance heavily relies on linguistic priors; without them, accuracy drops from 90% to 20%. Traditional OCR methods outperform it under semantic perturbations, and high visual compression increases hallucination risks, limiting its long-context viability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether DeepSeek-OCR's performance stems from visual merit or linguistic crutches, addressing its claim of solving the LLM long-context bottleneck.

Method: Use sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption to isolate OCR capabilities from language priors, benchmark against 13 baselines, and test robustness to visual token reduction and context stress.

Result: Performance drops sharply without linguistic support; traditional OCR methods are more robust. High compression increases reliance on priors and hallucination risks. Model collapses around 10,000 tokens.

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR's reliance on language priors limits its robustness and long-context applicability, highlighting the need for optimization in vision-text compression.

Abstract: DeepSeek-OCR utilizes an optical 2D mapping approach to achieve high-ratio vision-text compression, claiming to decode text tokens exceeding ten times the input visual tokens. While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: "Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck. This study empirically defines DeepSeek-OCR's capability boundaries and offers essential insights for future optimizations of the vision-text compression paradigm. We release all data, results and scripts used in this study at https://github.com/dududuck00/DeepSeekOCR.

TL;DR: MIND is a framework for distilling LLM capabilities into smaller models by adapting to student preferences and mitigating misalignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of transferring LLM reasoning abilities to smaller models without losing domain performance or cross-domain generalization.

Method: MIND uses a capability-adaptive framework with a 'Teaching Assistant' network and Feedback-Driven Inertia Calibration to align supervision dynamically.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, confirmed by latent space analysis.

Conclusion: MIND effectively enhances reasoning ability internalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged with remarkable capabilities in complex tasks through Chain-of-Thought reasoning, practical resource constraints have sparked interest in transferring these abilities to smaller models. However, achieving both domain performance and cross-domain generalization remains challenging. Existing approaches typically restrict students to following a single golden rationale and treat different reasoning paths independently. Due to distinct inductive biases and intrinsic preferences, alongside the student's evolving capacity and reasoning preferences during training, a teacher's "optimal" rationale could act as out-of-distribution noise. This misalignment leads to a degeneration of the student's latent reasoning distribution, causing suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose MIND, a capability-adaptive framework that transitions distillation from passive mimicry to active cognitive construction. We synthesize diverse teacher perspectives through a novel "Teaching Assistant" network. By employing a Feedback-Driven Inertia Calibration mechanism, this network utilizes inertia-filtered training loss to align supervision with the student's current adaptability, effectively enhancing performance while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIND achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, and our sophisticated latent space analysis further confirms the mechanism of reasoning ability internalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASR systems perform poorly on stuttered speech, especially in low-resource languages lacking specialized datasets.

Method: A framework generates synthetic stuttered audio by injecting dysfluencies into fluent text via rule-based transformations and LLMs, followed by TTS synthesis. This data fine-tunes a pre-trained Indonesian Whisper model.

Result: The approach reduces recognition errors on stuttered speech while preserving fluent speech performance.

Conclusion: Synthetic data pipelines are effective for creating inclusive ASR technologies in underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition systems have achieved remarkable performance on fluent speech but continue to degrade significantly when processing stuttered speech, a limitation that is particularly acute for low-resource languages like Indonesian where specialized datasets are virtually non-existent. To overcome this scarcity, we propose a data augmentation framework that generates synthetic stuttered audio by injecting repetitions and prolongations into fluent text through a combination of rule-based transformations and large language models followed by text-to-speech synthesis. We apply this synthetic data to fine-tune a pre-trained Indonesian Whisper model using transfer learning, enabling the architecture to adapt to dysfluent acoustic patterns without requiring large-scale real-world recordings. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted synthetic exposure consistently reduces recognition errors on stuttered speech while maintaining performance on fluent segments, validating the utility of synthetic data pipelines for developing more inclusive speech technologies in under-represented languages.

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs resolve knowledge conflicts based on source credibility, finding biases toward institutional sources but reversibility via repetition, and proposes a method to mitigate repetition bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of knowledge conflicts, inspired by interdisciplinary research on credibility.

Method: Evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs using a novel framework to test source preferences under controlled conditions, proposing a method to reduce repetition bias.

Result: LLMs prefer institutional sources over social media or personal sources, but repetition can reverse preferences. The proposed method reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8% while retaining 88.8% of original preferences.

Conclusion: Source preferences in LLMs are malleable under repetition, but can be stabilized with the proposed method. The findings encourage future work on credibility in NLP.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are more frequently used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, it is increasingly relevant to study their behavior under knowledge conflicts. Thus far, the role of the source of the retrieved information has gone unexamined. We address this gap with a novel framework to investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of inter-context knowledge conflicts in English, motivated by interdisciplinary research on credibility. With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media. However, these source preferences can be reversed by simply repeating information from less credible sources. To mitigate repetition effects and maintain consistent preferences, we propose a novel method that reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8%, while also maintaining at least 88.8% of original preferences. We release all data and code to encourage future work on credibility and source preferences in knowledge-intensive NLP.

Motivation: To investigate how personalization affects the quality and detectability of machine-generated texts in multiple languages, beyond just English.

Method: Analyzed 1,080 combinations of personalization prompts across 10 languages, generating 17,280 texts using 16 language models.

Result: Personalization quality varies by demographic groups and platforms, with English showing the highest quality and platform personalization significantly impacting detectability.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the nuanced effects of personalization on multilingual text generation, emphasizing the need for broader language studies.

Abstract: Capabilities of large language models to generate multilingual coherent text have continuously enhanced in recent years, which opens concerns about their potential misuse. Previous research has shown that they can be misused for generation of personalized disinformation in multiple languages. It has also been observed that personalization negatively affects detectability of machine-generated texts; however, this has been studied in the English language only. In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total). Our results indicate that there are differences in personalization quality of the generated texts when targeting demographic groups and when targeting social-media platforms across languages. Personalization towards platforms affects detectability of the generated texts in a higher scale, especially in English, where the personalization quality is the highest.

### [139] [Do LLM Self-Explanations Help Users Predict Model Behavior? Evaluating Counterfactual Simulatability with Pragmatic Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03775)
*Pingjun Hong,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-explanations improve prediction of LLM behavior for humans and LLM judges, but effectiveness varies by perturbation strategy and judge strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLM-generated explanations help users predict model behavior despite potential unreliability in reflecting true decision processes.

Method: Evaluate humans and LLM judges' ability to predict model answers using counterfactual simulatability on StrategyQA, with/without explanations (chain-of-thought or post-hoc). Compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations.

Result: Self-explanations improve simulation accuracy for both humans and LLM judges, but gains depend on perturbation strategy and judge strength. Humans form more accurate predictions with explanations.

Conclusion: LLM-generated explanations aid in predicting model behavior, though their effectiveness is context-dependent.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce verbalized self-explanations, yet prior studies suggest that such rationales may not reliably reflect the model's true decision process. We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength. We also conduct a qualitative analysis of free-text justifications written by human users when predicting the model's behavior, which provides evidence that access to explanations helps humans form more accurate predictions on the perturbed questions.

*Marco Baroni,Emily Cheng,Iria deDios-Flores,Francesca Franzon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how intrinsic dimension (ID) of LLM representations reflects linguistic complexity, distinguishing between formal and functional complexity with varying ID profiles across model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if ID can serve as a marker for different types of linguistic complexity and if it aligns with known phases of abstract linguistic processing.

Method: Analyzed ID differences across LLM layers for formal and functional contrasts, using representational similarity and layer ablation experiments.

Result: Formal contrasts showed clearer ID differences linked to abstract processing, while functional contrasts were less marked and not phase-aligned.

Conclusion: ID effectively marks linguistic complexity, distinguishes complexity types, and consistently indicates processing stages across LLMs.

Abstract: We explore the intrinsic dimension (ID) of LLM representations as a marker of linguistic complexity, asking if different ID profiles across LLM layers differentially characterize formal and functional complexity. We find the formal contrast between sentences with multiple coordinated or subordinated clauses to be reflected in ID differences whose onset aligns with a phase of more abstract linguistic processing independently identified in earlier work. The functional contrasts between sentences characterized by right branching vs. center embedding or unambiguous vs. ambiguous relative clause attachment are also picked up by ID, but in a less marked way, and they do not correlate with the same processing phase. Further experiments using representational similarity and layer ablation confirm the same trends. We conclude that ID is a useful marker of linguistic complexity in LLMs, that it allows to differentiate between different types of complexity, and that it points to similar stages of linguistic processing across disparate LLMs.

TL;DR: ALLMs inadvertently leak user privacy through voiceprints, with significant accuracy in profiling attributes and inadequate safeguards, exacerbated by reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate privacy implications of ALLMs via voiceprints and assess their safety mechanisms.

Method: Introduces HearSay benchmark with 22,000 audio clips, uses automated profiling and human verification for data quality, and conducts extensive experiments.

Result: ALLMs leak private attributes (92.89% accuracy on gender), safeguards are insufficient, and reasoning methods amplify risks.

Conclusion: Highlights vulnerabilities in ALLMs, urging targeted privacy alignment improvements.

Abstract: While Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in understanding and generation, their potential privacy implications remain largely unexplored. This paper takes the first step to investigate whether ALLMs inadvertently leak user privacy solely through acoustic voiceprints and introduces $\textit{HearSay}$, a comprehensive benchmark constructed from over 22,000 real-world audio clips. To ensure data quality, the benchmark is meticulously curated through a rigorous pipeline involving automated profiling and human verification, guaranteeing that all privacy labels are grounded in factual records. Extensive experiments on $\textit{HearSay}$ yield three critical findings: $\textbf{Significant Privacy Leakage}$: ALLMs inherently extract private attributes from voiceprints, reaching 92.89% accuracy on gender and effectively profiling social attributes. $\textbf{Insufficient Safety Mechanisms}$: Alarmingly, existing safeguards are severely inadequate; most models fail to refuse privacy-intruding requests, exhibiting near-zero refusal rates for physiological traits. $\textbf{Reasoning Amplifies Risk}$: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning exacerbates privacy risks in capable models by uncovering deeper acoustic correlations. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in ALLMs, underscoring the urgent need for targeted privacy alignment.

### [142] [Membox: Weaving Topic Continuity into Long-Range Memory for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03785)
*Dehao Tao,Guoliang Ma,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Membox introduces a hierarchical memory architecture to preserve topic continuity in human-agent dialogues, outperforming existing methods with improved efficiency and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmentation of dialogue streams in LLM memory systems, which disrupts narrative and causal flow, Membox aims to model and preserve topic continuity.

Method: Membox uses a Topic Loom for real-time grouping of same-topic turns into 'memory boxes' and a Trace Weaver to link these boxes into long-range event-timeline traces.

Result: Experiments show Membox improves temporal reasoning by up to 68% F1, using fewer context tokens than baselines like Mem0 and A-MEM.

Conclusion: Membox enhances coherence and efficiency in LLM agents by explicitly modeling topic continuity, offering a cognitively motivated solution.

Abstract: Human-agent dialogues often exhibit topic continuity-a stable thematic frame that evolves through temporally adjacent exchanges-yet most large language model (LLM) agent memory systems fail to preserve it. Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent "memory boxes" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.

### [143] [Compact Example-Based Explanations for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03786)
*Loris Schoenegger,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel selection relevance score to improve the quality of example-based explanations in machine learning by evaluating and optimizing the selection of training documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training data influence estimation methods often lack effective strategies for selecting the most relevant documents for explanations, despite their direct impact on explanation quality.

Method: The authors propose a retraining-free metric called selection relevance score to assess the usefulness of example sets for explanations, validated through fine-tuning experiments.

Result: Common selection strategies often perform worse than random selection; a new strategy balancing influence and representativeness outperforms naive top-ranking selection.

Conclusion: The proposed selection relevance score and strategy enhance explanation quality by optimizing the use of selection budgets for training data influence estimation.

Abstract: Training data influence estimation methods quantify the contribution of training documents to a model's output, making them a promising source of information for example-based explanations. As humans cannot interpret thousands of documents, only a small subset of the training data can be presented as an explanation. Although the choice of which documents to include directly affects explanation quality, previous evaluations of such systems have largely ignored any selection strategies. To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions. Using this metric, we further show that common selection strategies often underperform random selection. Motivated by this finding, we propose a strategy that balances influence and representativeness, enabling better use of selection budgets than naively selecting the highest-ranking examples.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeoAMT, a framework for neologism-aware machine translation using a Wiktionary-based search tool, with a new multilingual dataset and RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underexplored field of neologism-aware MT, the authors aim to improve translation of sentences containing new words.

Method: Developed NeoAMT with a Wiktionary search tool, created a multilingual dataset, and proposed an RL framework with novel rewards and adaptive rollout generation.

Result: A dataset covering 16 languages and 75 translation directions was built, and the RL framework improved translation quality.

Conclusion: NeoAMT effectively enhances neologism-aware MT, demonstrating potential for broader applications in the field.

Abstract: Neologism-aware machine translation aims to translate source sentences containing neologisms into target languages. This field remains underexplored compared with general machine translation (MT). In this paper, we propose an agentic framework, NeoAMT, for neologism-aware machine translation using a Wiktionary search tool. Specifically, we first create a new dataset for neologism-aware machine translation and develop a search tool based on Wiktionary. The new dataset covers 16 languages and 75 translation directions and is derived from approximately 10 million records of an English Wiktionary dump. The retrieval corpus of the search tool is also constructed from around 3 million cleaned records of the Wiktionary dump. We then use it for training the translation agent with reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluating the accuracy of neologism-aware machine translation. Based on this, we also propose an RL training framework that contains a novel reward design and an adaptive rollout generation approach by leveraging "translation difficulty" to further improve the translation quality of translation agents using our search tool.

### [145] [Do LLMs Really Memorize Personally Identifiable Information? Revisiting PII Leakage with a Cue-Controlled Memorization Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03791)
*Xiaoyu Luo,Yiyi Chen,Qiongxiu Li,Johannes Bjerva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that PII leakage in LLMs should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions to avoid misinterpreting pattern completion as memorization, proposing CRM as a framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more accurate and reliable evaluation of PII leakage in LLMs, differentiating between true memorization and cue-driven behavior.

Method: Introduces Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a framework to evaluate PII leakage under controlled cue conditions, testing across 32 languages and multiple paradigms.

Result: Reconstruction success is largely due to surface-form cues; when controlled, success diminishes. Cue-free methods show low true positive rates.

Conclusion: PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than memorization, emphasizing the need for cue-controlled evaluation to assess privacy risks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to "leak" Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with successful PII reconstruction often interpreted as evidence of memorization. We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VietMed-MCQ, a specialized Vietnamese Traditional Medicine dataset, created using Retrieval-Augmented Generation and dual-model validation. It addresses LLMs' limitations in culturally specific domains and benchmarks seven models, revealing insights into cross-lingual transfer and diagnostic reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform poorly in specialized, culturally specific domains like Vietnamese Traditional Medicine due to lack of structured benchmarks.

Method: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline with dual-model validation ensures reasoning consistency in the VietMed-MCQ dataset (3,190 questions).

Result: General-purpose models with Chinese priors outperformed Vietnamese-centric models, showing cross-lingual transfer. All models struggled with complex diagnostic reasoning.

Conclusion: The VietMed-MCQ dataset fills a gap in low-resource medical domains, fostering research despite limitations in substring-based evidence checking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in general medical domains. However, their performance significantly degrades in specialized, culturally specific domains such as Vietnamese Traditional Medicine (VTM), primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality, structured benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce VietMed-MCQ, a novel multiple-choice question dataset generated via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with an automated consistency check mechanism. Unlike previous synthetic datasets, our framework incorporates a dual-model validation approach to ensure reasoning consistency through independent answer verification, though the substring-based evidence checking has known limitations. The complete dataset of 3,190 questions spans three difficulty levels and underwent validation by one medical expert and four students, achieving 94.2 percent approval with substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.82). We benchmark seven open-source models on VietMed-MCQ. Results reveal that general-purpose models with strong Chinese priors outperform Vietnamese-centric models, highlighting cross-lingual conceptual transfer, while all models still struggle with complex diagnostic reasoning. Our code and dataset are publicly available to foster research in low-resource medical domains.

*Taisiia Tikhomirova,Dirk U. Wulff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how psychologically meaningful aspects of language are encoded in transformer models, revealing that localization depends on embedding methods and model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer models encode psycholinguistic features, aiding both theoretical insights and practical applications.

Method: Layer-wise probing of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, comparing three embedding extraction methods.

Result: Meaning localization is method-dependent; final layers are rarely optimal for psycholinguistic feature recovery, but models share a depth ordering of meaning dimensions.

Conclusion: The interaction of methodological choices and architectural constraints determines where meaning is encoded in transformers.

Abstract: Understanding where transformer language models encode psychologically meaningful aspects of meaning is essential for both theory and practice. We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning "lives" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.

TL;DR: InfiniteWeb generates scalable, functional web environments for GUI agent training, outperforming commercial coding agents and improving GUI agent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents need realistic training environments, but existing options are scarce. InfiniteWeb aims to fill this gap by automating large-scale functional web environment generation.

Method: The system uses unified specification, task-centric test-driven development, and a mix of website seed and reference design images for diversity. It also generates verifiable task evaluators for reinforcement learning rewards.

Result: InfiniteWeb outperforms commercial coding agents in realistic website construction. GUI agents trained on its environments show significant improvements on OSWorld and Online-Mind2Web benchmarks.

Conclusion: InfiniteWeb effectively addresses the scarcity of training environments for GUI agents, demonstrating superior performance and utility.

Abstract: GUI agents that interact with graphical interfaces on behalf of users represent a promising direction for practical AI assistants. However, training such agents is hindered by the scarcity of suitable environments. We present InfiniteWeb, a system that automatically generates functional web environments at scale for GUI agent training. While LLMs perform well on generating a single webpage, building a realistic and functional website with many interconnected pages faces challenges. We address these challenges through unified specification, task-centric test-driven development, and a combination of website seed with reference design image to ensure diversity. Our system also generates verifiable task evaluators enabling dense reward signals for reinforcement learning. Experiments show that InfiniteWeb surpasses commercial coding agents at realistic website construction, and GUI agents trained on our generated environments achieve significant performance improvements on OSWorld and Online-Mind2Web, demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed system.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates AI text detection methods, comparing traditional and transformer-based models, highlighting DistilBERT's superior performance, and discussing future improvements like dataset diversity and efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated text in student work threatens academic integrity, prompting the need for effective detection methods.

Method: Traditional (TF-IDF logistic regression) and deep learning (BiLSTM, DistilBERT) models are evaluated using HC3 and DAIGT v2 datasets with topic-based splits for robustness.

Result: DistilBERT outperforms others with 88.11% accuracy and 0.96 ROC-AUC, showing contextual semantics surpass lexical features.

Conclusion: Future work will focus on dataset diversity, efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA), and optimizing smaller models.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has led to an increase in AI-generated text, with students increasingly using LLM-generated content as their own work, which violates academic integrity. This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%. However, deep learning models outperform it. The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints. In future work, we plan to expand dataset diversity and utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA. We also plan to explore smaller or distilled models and employ more efficient batching strategies and hardware-aware optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPAE enhances RLVR by introducing Step Potential Advantage Estimation, improving reasoning accuracy and efficiency in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods lack step-level reasoning progress measures, leading to redundant verification or incorrect corrections.

Method: Introduces Step Potential signal for intermediate confidence/correctness and SPAE for fine-grained credit assignment.

Result: SPAE improves accuracy and reduces response length across benchmarks, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: SPAE provides a robust solution for fine-grained reasoning supervision in RLVR.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) elicits long chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but outcome-based rewards lead to coarse-grained advantage estimation. While existing approaches improve RLVR via token-level entropy or sequence-level length control, they lack a semantically grounded, step-level measure of reasoning progress. As a result, LLMs fail to distinguish necessary deduction from redundant verification: they may continue checking after reaching a correct solution and, in extreme cases, overturn a correct trajectory into an incorrect final answer. To remedy the lack of process supervision, we introduce a training-free probing mechanism that extracts intermediate confidence and correctness and combines them into a Step Potential signal that explicitly estimates the reasoning state at each step. Building on this signal, we propose Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), a fine-grained credit assignment method that amplifies potential gains, penalizes potential drops, and applies penalty after potential saturates to encourage timely termination. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show SPAE consistently improves accuracy while substantially reducing response length, outperforming strong RL baselines and recent efficient reasoning and token-level advantage estimation methods. The code is available at https://github.com/cii030/SPAE-RL.

TL;DR: TabTrim introduces a gold trajectory-supervised parallel search framework for table pruning, improving accuracy in TableQA tasks by avoiding unreliable sequential revisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing table pruning methods rely on sequential revisions with unreliable critique signals, often missing critical data loss.

Method: TabTrim uses gold pruning trajectories from SQL queries, training a pruner and verifier for alignment, and performs parallel search during inference.

Result: TabTrim-8B achieves 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming baselines by 3.2%, with 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.

Conclusion: TabTrim's parallel search and gold trajectory supervision advance table pruning, setting new benchmarks in TableQA performance.

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TableQA) benefits significantly from table pruning, which extracts compact sub-tables by eliminating redundant cells to streamline downstream reasoning. However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.

*Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Simone Alghisi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates Continual Pre-Training (CPT) as a knowledge learning process, revealing misalignment between loss optimization and factual learning dynamics, unstable knowledge consolidation, and degradation in out-of-domain skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than just an optimization problem, and to analyze its effects on factual knowledge acquisition and OOD skills.

Method: Constructed a controlled benchmark of factual documents with diagnostic probes interleaved into the CPT loop to measure knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in OOD skills. Analyzed knowledge circuit reconfiguration during training.

Result: Loss optimization diverges from learning progress: loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Knowledge consolidation is rare, OOD performance degrades early, and knowledge pathways reconfigure rapidly.

Conclusion: CPT's loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress, motivating task-level evaluation of stopping criteria. Factual learning is unstable, and knowledge circuits change dynamically, leading to forgetting and narrow acquisition windows.

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) is widely used for acquiring and updating factual knowledge in LLMs. This practice treats loss as a proxy for knowledge learning, while offering no grounding into how it changes during training. We study CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than a solely optimization problem. We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PartisanLens, a multilingual dataset for detecting hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives, evaluates LLMs' performance and annotation potential, and explores conditioning LLMs on annotator profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the scarcity of multilingual resources for detecting hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives, which threaten social cohesion and public safety due to their role in political polarization and extremist violence.

Method: The authors create PartisanLens, a dataset of hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated for political discourse aspects. They evaluate LLMs' classification performance and assess their potential as automatic annotators, including conditioning LLMs on socio-economic and ideological profiles.

Result: The study establishes baselines for LLM classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives, highlighting their potential and limitations as annotators. It also explores LLMs' ability to emulate human annotation patterns.

Conclusion: PartisanLens provides valuable resources for future research on detecting partisan and conspiratorial narratives in European contexts, emphasizing the need for improved multilingual and socio-culturally aware tools.

Abstract: Detecting hyperpartisan narratives and Population Replacement Conspiracy Theories (PRCT) is essential to addressing the spread of misinformation. These complex narratives pose a significant threat, as hyperpartisanship drives political polarisation and institutional distrust, while PRCTs directly motivate real-world extremist violence, making their identification critical for social cohesion and public safety. However, existing resources are scarce, predominantly English-centric, and often analyse hyperpartisanship, stance, and rhetorical bias in isolation rather than as interrelated aspects of political discourse. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textsc{PartisanLens}, the first multilingual dataset of \num{1617} hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated in multiple political discourse aspects. We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation. Results highlight both their potential and current limitations. Next, moving beyond standard judgments, we explore whether LLMs can emulate human annotation patterns by conditioning them on socio-economic and ideological profiles that simulate annotator perspectives. At last, we provide our resources and evaluation, \textsc{PartisanLens} supports future research on detecting partisan and conspiratorial narratives in European contexts.

Conclusion: Safety must be prioritized during training and deployment, and safeguards are needed against vulnerabilities like CoT attacks and adversarial prompts.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the safety alignment capabilities. We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards. Fourth, roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based search for adversarial prompts are the predominant methodologies for eliciting unaligned behaviors in modern models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ATLAS introduces a dual-path framework for dynamic tool usage in AI agents, combining training-free cluster-based routing and RL-based multi-step routing, outperforming GPT-4o and existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of LLMs and tools creates a high-dimensional optimization challenge. Existing approaches lack adaptability across heterogeneous model-tool pairs.

Method: ATLAS uses a dual-path approach: (1) training-free cluster-based routing for domain-specific alignment, and (2) RL-based multi-step routing for out-of-distribution generalization.

Result: Experiments on 15 benchmarks show ATLAS outperforms GPT-4o (+10.1% in-distribution, +13.1% out-of-distribution) and excels in visual reasoning with multi-modal tools.

Conclusion: ATLAS effectively addresses the challenge of dynamic tool usage, demonstrating superior performance and adaptability across diverse tasks.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external tools has significantly expanded the capabilities of AI agents. However, as the diversity of both LLMs and tools increases, selecting the optimal model-tool combination becomes a high-dimensional optimization challenge. Existing approaches often rely on a single model or fixed tool-calling logic, failing to exploit the performance variations across heterogeneous model-tool pairs. In this paper, we present ATLAS (Adaptive Tool-LLM Alignment and Synergistic Invocation), a dual-path framework for dynamic tool usage in cross-domain complex reasoning. ATLAS operates via a dual-path approach: (1) \textbf{training-free cluster-based routing} that exploits empirical priors for domain-specific alignment, and (2) \textbf{RL-based multi-step routing} that explores autonomous trajectories for out-of-distribution generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o, surpassing existing routing methods on both in-distribution (+10.1%) and out-of-distribution (+13.1%) tasks. Furthermore, our framework shows significant gains in visual reasoning by orchestrating specialized multi-modal tools.

*Anthony Lamelas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small decoder-only language models (SLMs) are tested for grammar correction and text simplification but underperform compared to large language models (LLMs), highlighting efficiency advantages but significant performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether small, decoder-only language models can serve as efficient alternatives to large language models for grammar correction and text simplification tasks, addressing accessibility and deployment challenges.

Method: Experiments tested small language models (SLMs) out-of-the-box, fine-tuned, and run sequentially on JFLEG and ASSET datasets using established metrics.

Result: SLMs perform below strong baselines and current LLMs, struggling with retaining meaning and hallucinations, despite efficiency advantages.

Conclusion: Current SLMs are not yet competitive with modern LLMs for rewriting tasks, requiring further training advances to narrow the performance gap.

Abstract: Large language models have become extremely popular recently due to their ability to achieve strong performance on a variety of tasks, such as text generation and rewriting, but their size and computation cost make them difficult to access, deploy, and secure in many settings. This paper investigates whether small, decoder-only language models can provide an efficient alternative for the tasks of grammar correction and text simplification. The experiments in this paper focus on testing small language models out of the box, fine-tuned, and run sequentially on the JFLEG and ASSET datasets using established metrics. The results show that while SLMs may learn certain behaviors well, their performance remains below strong baselines and current LLMs. The results also show that SLMs struggle with retaining meaning and hallucinations. These findings suggest that despite their efficiency advantages, current SLMs are not yet competitive enough with modern LLMs for rewriting, and further advances in training are required for SLMs to close the performance gap between them and today's LLMs.

*Wang Chen,Guanqiang Qi,Weikang Li,Yang Li,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Decide Then Retrieve (DTR), a framework enhancing RAG by adaptive retrieval triggering and dual-path evidence construction, improving QA performance while reducing unnecessary retrievals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG approaches trigger retrieval indiscriminately and use single-path evidence, introducing noise and limiting gains.

Method: Introduces DTR, a training-free framework using generation uncertainty for adaptive retrieval triggering and dual-path retrieval with adaptive information selection.

Result: Improves EM and F1 over standard RAG and baselines across five QA benchmarks, multiple model scales, and retrievers, reducing unnecessary retrievals.

Conclusion: DTR effectively enhances RAG by adaptively determining retrieval needs and better handling sparse/ambiguous queries.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, but existing approaches indiscriminately trigger retrieval and rely on single-path evidence construction, often introducing noise and limiting performance gains. In this work, we propose Decide Then Retrieve (DTR), a training-free framework that adaptively determines when retrieval is necessary and how external information should be selected. DTR leverages generation uncertainty to guide retrieval triggering and introduces a dual-path retrieval mechanism with adaptive information selection to better handle sparse and ambiguous queries. Extensive experiments across five open-domain QA benchmarks, multiple model scales, and different retrievers demonstrate that DTR consistently improves EM and F1 over standard RAG and strong retrieval-enhanced baselines, while reducing unnecessary retrievals.

*Hugh Mee Wong,Rick Nouwen,Albert Gatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how language models handle multiple-choice question answering, revealing a two-stage process: selecting the correct answer in content space first, then binding it to the symbol for output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms of language models in MCQA, distinguishing reasoning errors from symbol-binding failures.

Method: Used representational analyses (PCA, linear probes) and causal interventions, focusing on residual states and winner-identity probing.

Result: Found that models first identify the correct answer in content space and later bind it to the output symbol, with evidence from symbol and content permutations.

Conclusion: Models implement MCQA via a two-stage mechanism: content selection followed by symbol binding, clarifying the distinction between reasoning and output errors.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is easy to evaluate but adds a meta-task: models must both solve the problem and output the symbol that *represents* the answer, conflating reasoning errors with symbol-binding failures. We study how language models implement MCQA internally using representational analyses (PCA, linear probes) as well as causal interventions. We find that option-boundary (newline) residual states often contain strong linearly decodable signals related to per-option correctness. Winner-identity probing reveals a two-stage progression: the winning *content position* becomes decodable immediately after the final option is processed, while the *output symbol* is represented closer to the answer emission position. Tests under symbol and content permutations support a two-stage mechanism in which models first select a winner in content space and then bind or route that winner to the appropriate symbol to emit.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Doc-PP Benchmark reveals systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap in LVLMs for document QA, solved by DVA framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety research overlooks multimodal document complexities in adhering to dynamic, user-defined policies.

Method: Introduces Doc-PP Benchmark and proposes DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation) framework for policy-compliant reasoning.

Result: Models leak sensitive info during complex reasoning; DVA outperforms standard defenses.

Conclusion: DVA provides a robust baseline for policy-compliant document understanding.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for real-world document question answering is often constrained by dynamic, user-defined policies that dictate information disclosure based on context. While ensuring adherence to these explicit constraints is critical, existing safety research primarily focuses on implicit social norms or text-only settings, overlooking the complexities of multimodal documents. In this paper, we introduce Doc-PP (Document Policy Preservation Benchmark), a novel benchmark constructed from real-world reports requiring reasoning across heterogeneous visual and textual elements under strict non-disclosure policies. Our evaluation highlights a systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap: models frequently leak sensitive information when answers must be inferred through complex synthesis or aggregated across modalities, effectively circumventing existing safety constraints. Furthermore, we identify that providing extracted text improves perception but inadvertently facilitates leakage. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation), a structural inference framework that decouples reasoning from policy verification. Experimental results demonstrate that DVA significantly outperforms standard prompting defenses, offering a robust baseline for policy-compliant document understanding

Motivation: The paper aims to address commercial needs by enhancing ABSA models with expanded sentiment classes, multilingual support, and improved reasoning capabilities.

Method: The models use a large corpus of public and synthetic data, reasoning injection via Chain-of-Thought examples, and a novel pretraining technique for encoder-only models.

Result: Achieved 10 percentage points higher accuracy than GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with multilingual models maintaining 87-91% accuracy across six languages.

Conclusion: Arctic-ABSA sets new state-of-the-art results, demonstrating superior performance and generalization across languages and domains.

Abstract: We introduce Arctic-ABSA, a collection of powerful models for real-life aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Our models are tailored to commercial needs, trained on a large corpus of public data alongside carefully generated synthetic data, resulting in a dataset 20 times larger than SemEval14. We extend typical ABSA models by expanding the number of sentiment classes from the standard three (positive, negative, neutral) to five, adding mixed and unknown classes, while also jointly predicting overall text sentiment and supporting multiple languages. We experiment with reasoning injection by fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples and introduce a novel reasoning pretraining technique for encoder-only models that significantly improves downstream fine-tuning and generalization. Our 395M-parameter encoder and 8B-parameter decoder achieve up to 10 percentage points higher accuracy than GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, while setting new state-of-the-art results on the SemEval14 benchmark. A single multilingual model maintains 87-91% accuracy across six languages without degrading English performance. We release ABSA-mix, a large-scale benchmark aggregating 17 public ABSA datasets across 92 domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat LLM-generated misinformation effectively by improving fake news detection.

Method: Uses a generator to rewrite real articles with factual perturbations and a lightweight detector with dense passage retrieval, enhanced by verbal adversarial feedback (VAF) for structured natural-language critiques.

Result: Achieves 86.98% ROC-AUC on a fake news detection benchmark, outperforming general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: RADAR demonstrates the effectiveness of detector-side retrieval and VAF for robust fake news detection.

Abstract: To efficiently combat the spread of LLM-generated misinformation, we present RADAR, a retrieval-augmented detector with adversarial refinement for robust fake news detection. Our approach employs a generator that rewrites real articles with factual perturbations, paired with a lightweight detector that verifies claims using dense passage retrieval. To enable effective co-evolution, we introduce verbal adversarial feedback (VAF). Rather than relying on scalar rewards, VAF issues structured natural-language critiques; these guide the generator toward more sophisticated evasion attempts, compelling the detector to adapt and improve. On a fake news detection benchmark, RADAR achieves 86.98% ROC-AUC, significantly outperforming general-purpose LLMs with retrieval. Ablation studies confirm that detector-side retrieval yields the largest gains, while VAF and few-shot demonstrations provide critical signals for robust training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid increase in LLM benchmarks necessitates systematic quality assessment methods to ensure reliable evaluations.

Method: Benchmark^2 introduces three metrics: Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, Discriminability Score, and Capability Alignment Deviation, tested on 15 benchmarks and 11 LLMs across domains like mathematics and reasoning.

Result: The framework identifies significant quality variations among benchmarks and shows that selective benchmark construction can maintain evaluation performance with smaller test sets.

Conclusion: Benchmark^2 effectively assesses benchmark quality, enabling more reliable and efficient evaluations of LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for systematic methods to assess benchmark quality itself. We propose Benchmark^2, a comprehensive framework comprising three complementary metrics: (1) Cross-Benchmark Ranking Consistency, measuring whether a benchmark produces model rankings aligned with peer benchmarks; (2) Discriminability Score, quantifying a benchmark's ability to differentiate between models; and (3) Capability Alignment Deviation, identifying problematic instances where stronger models fail but weaker models succeed within the same model family. We conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks spanning mathematics, reasoning, and knowledge domains, evaluating 11 LLMs across four model families. Our analysis reveals significant quality variations among existing benchmarks and demonstrates that selective benchmark construction based on our metrics can achieve comparable evaluation performance with substantially reduced test sets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VotIE introduces a task for extracting voting events from municipal meeting minutes, with experiments showing fine-tuned encoders perform best in-domain, while LLMs are more robust cross-municipality, though costly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Municipal meeting minutes record voting outcomes in heterogeneous, free-form text, making automated extraction challenging.

Method: VotIE is introduced as a new task, benchmarked using Portuguese municipal minutes, and tested with models like XLM-R-CRF and LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuned encoders achieve 93.2% macro F1 in-domain but degrade cross-municipality, while LLMs show robustness but are computationally costly.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned encoders are more practical for large-scale use, but LLMs offer generalization benefits; benchmark and models are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Municipal meeting minutes record key decisions in local democratic processes. Unlike parliamentary proceedings, which typically adhere to standardized formats, they encode voting outcomes in highly heterogeneous, free-form narrative text that varies widely across municipalities, posing significant challenges for automated extraction. In this paper, we introduce VotIE (Voting Information Extraction), a new information extraction task aimed at identifying structured voting events in narrative deliberative records, and establish the first benchmark for this task using Portuguese municipal minutes, building on the recently introduced CitiLink corpus. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality. As a result, lightweight fine-tuned encoders remain a more practical option for large-scale, real-world deployment. To support reproducible research in administrative NLP, we publicly release our benchmark, trained models, and evaluation framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the quality of simulated students in LLM-powered tutoring, proposing metrics and benchmarking methods, finding current approaches lacking and motivating future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of quality measurement for simulated students in LLM-powered tutoring, which is crucial for scalable and effective educational innovations.

Method: Formally defines the student simulation task, proposes evaluation metrics (linguistic, behavioral, cognitive), and benchmarks various simulation methods on a real-world math tutoring dataset.

Result: Prompting strategies perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization show better but still limited results, as confirmed by automated and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Current student simulation methods are inadequate, highlighting the need for further research to improve their effectiveness.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) enable many new innovations in education. However, evaluating the effectiveness of new technology requires real students, which is time-consuming and hard to scale up. Therefore, many recent works on LLM-powered tutoring solutions have used simulated students for both training and evaluation, often via simple prompting. Surprisingly, little work has been done to ensure or even measure the quality of simulated students. In this work, we formally define the student simulation task, propose a set of evaluation metrics that span linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects, and benchmark a wide range of student simulation methods on these metrics. We experiment on a real-world math tutoring dialogue dataset, where both automated and human evaluation results show that prompting strategies for student simulation perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization yield much better but still limited performance, motivating future work on this challenging task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpeakerSleuth evaluates Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) for judging speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues, revealing biases toward text over acoustics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn conversations, a critical gap in current evaluation methods.

Method: SpeakerSleuth benchmark with 1,818 human-verified instances across four datasets, testing nine LALMs on three tasks reflecting real-world requirements.

Result: LALMs struggle with detecting acoustic inconsistencies, prioritize text over acoustics, and degrade performance when other interlocutors' turns are included. However, they perform better in acoustic discrimination tasks.

Conclusion: LALMs exhibit significant modality biases, highlighting the need to address these imbalances for reliable audio-language judging systems.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) as judges have emerged as a prominent approach for evaluating speech generation quality, yet their ability to assess speaker consistency across multi-turn conversations remains unexplored. We present SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues through three tasks reflecting real-world requirements. We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities. These findings expose a significant bias in LALMs: they tend to prioritize text over acoustics, revealing fundamental modality imbalances that need to be addressed to build reliable audio-language judges.

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges in multilingual machine translation, focusing on cross-lingual knowledge transfer, especially for low-resource languages, and develops methods to improve robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulties in multilingual machine translation, particularly for low-resource languages, by examining representation interactions, data availability, and training strategies.

Method: Analyzes language similarity's impact on transfer, uses retrieval and auxiliary supervision for low-resource translation, explores fine-tuning trade-offs, and examines language diversity's role.

Result: Increasing translation coverage improves generalization and reduces off-target behavior; modeling choices and data composition significantly impact multilingual learning.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for building more inclusive and resilient multilingual NLP systems by optimizing cross-lingual knowledge transfer and training strategies.

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation systems aim to make knowledge accessible across languages, yet learning effective cross-lingual representations remains challenging. These challenges are especially pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited parallel data constrains generalization and transfer. Understanding how multilingual models share knowledge across languages requires examining the interaction between representations, data availability, and training strategies. In this thesis, we study cross-lingual knowledge transfer in neural models and develop methods to improve robustness and generalization in multilingual settings, using machine translation as a central testbed. We analyze how similarity between languages influences transfer, how retrieval and auxiliary supervision can strengthen low-resource translation, and how fine-tuning on parallel data can introduce unintended trade-offs in large language models. We further examine the role of language diversity during training and show that increasing translation coverage improves generalization and reduces off-target behavior. Together, this work highlights how modeling choices and data composition shape multilingual learning and offers insights toward more inclusive and resilient multilingual NLP systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess safety risks posed by MLLMs' responses in real-world scenarios and address gaps in current safety evaluations.

Method: Introduces SaLAD, a dataset with 2,013 image-text samples across 10 categories, emphasizing realistic risks and cross-modal reasoning. Evaluates 18 MLLMs using a safety-warning framework.

Result: Top models achieve only 57.2% safe response rate on unsafe queries; current safety alignment methods show limited effectiveness.

Conclusion: Highlights vulnerabilities in MLLMs' safety detection, advocating for improved frameworks and datasets.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) become an indispensable assistant in human life, the unsafe content generated by MLLMs poses a danger to human behavior, perpetually overhanging human society like a sword of Damocles. To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life.

*Prith Sharma,Austin Z. Henley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPO is a modular prompt optimization framework that refines fixed semantic sections of prompts independently, achieving better performance than monolithic approaches in reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of monolithic prompt optimization, which struggles with error localization and uncontrolled growth, by introducing a structured, section-based approach.

Method: MPO treats prompts as structured objects with fixed sections, applying localized textual gradients to refine each section independently while maintaining the overall schema.

Result: MPO outperforms untuned structured prompts and TextGrad on ARC-Challenge and MMLU benchmarks, showing significant accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: Localized, section-wise optimization within a fixed prompt schema is effective for enhancing reasoning performance in small LMs.

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a central role in controlling the behavior, reliability, and reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly for smaller open-source instruction-tuned models that depend heavily on explicit structure. While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoM-DAD introduces a hierarchical dual-process framework for unified multimodal text-image generation, combining continuous latent diffusion for semantics and discrete absorbing diffusion for tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models are bifurcated into autoregressive (text) and diffusion (image) approaches, hindering unified multimodal systems. MLMs lack generative fidelity and semantic continuity, and extending masked generation to multimodal settings poses alignment and stability challenges.

Method: CoM-DAD decouples semantic planning (continuous latent diffusion) from token synthesis (discrete absorbing diffusion). It uses a Variable-Rate Noise Schedule and Stochastic Mixed-Modal Transport for alignment.

Result: The method shows superior stability over standard masked modeling, enabling scalable and unified text-image generation.

Conclusion: CoM-DAD establishes a new paradigm for multimodal generation, addressing alignment and stability issues inherent in existing approaches.

Abstract: The bifurcation of generative modeling into autoregressive approaches for discrete data (text) and diffusion approaches for continuous data (images) hinders the development of truly unified multimodal systems. While Masked Language Models (MLMs) offer efficient bidirectional context, they traditionally lack the generative fidelity of autoregressive models and the semantic continuity of diffusion models. Furthermore, extending masked generation to multimodal settings introduces severe alignment challenges and training instability. In this work, we propose \textbf{CoM-DAD} (\textbf{Co}upled \textbf{M}anifold \textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{A}bsorbing \textbf{D}iffusion), a novel probabilistic framework that reformulates multimodal generation as a hierarchical dual-process. CoM-DAD decouples high-level semantic planning from low-level token synthesis. First, we model the semantic manifold via a continuous latent diffusion process; second, we treat token generation as a discrete absorbing diffusion process, regulated by a \textbf{Variable-Rate Noise Schedule}, conditioned on these evolving semantic priors. Crucially, we introduce a \textbf{Stochastic Mixed-Modal Transport} strategy that aligns disparate modalities without requiring heavy contrastive dual-encoders. Our method demonstrates superior stability over standard masked modeling, establishing a new paradigm for scalable, unified text-image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs, often induced by prompts, undermine accuracy and reliability. The authors aim to mitigate these errors by leveraging structured knowledge during inference.

Method: The approach extends chain-style knowledge distillation with a programmable module embedded as executable code in prompts, regulating intermediate reasoning steps.

Result: Evaluations on GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3 show significant improvements: HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 scores increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, exceeding 95% in many settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces hallucinations, enhances accuracy, and improves interpretability by constraining erroneous reasoning.

Abstract: To mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), we propose a framework that focuses on errors induced by prompts. Our method extends a chain-style knowledge distillation approach by incorporating a programmable module that guides knowledge graph exploration. This module is embedded as executable code within the reasoning prompt, allowing the model to leverage external structured knowledge during inference. Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3. Experimental results show that code-guided reasoning significantly improves contextual modeling and reduces prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, with scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These findings indicate that the proposed method effectively constrains erroneous reasoning while improving both accuracy and interpretability.

### [171] [SearchAttack: Red-Teaming LLMs against Real-World Threats via Framing Unsafe Web Information-Seeking Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04093)
*Yu Yan,Sheng Sun,Mingfeng Li,Zheming Yang,Chiwei Zhu,Fei Ma,Benfeng Xu,Min Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SearchAttack identifies web search as a vulnerability in search-augmented LLMs and proposes a red-teaming method to exploit it for harmful tasks, proving effective in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unreliability of LLMs for open and knowledge-intensive tasks has led to the use of search-augmented LLMs. However, when search engines return harmful content, LLM safeguards fail, prompting the need for vulnerability assessment.

Method: SearchAttack leverages web search by outsourcing harmful semantics, using fragmented clues and structural rubrics to steer LLMs into reconstructing retrieved content for malicious purposes.

Result: SearchAttack effectively attacks search-augmented LLMs, demonstrating its strength in red-teaming for vulnerability assessment.

Conclusion: The study highlights a critical attack surface in search-augmented LLMs and offers a practical method (SearchAttack) to assess and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Recently, people have suffered and become increasingly aware of the unreliability gap in LLMs for open and knowledge-intensive tasks, and thus turn to search-augmented LLMs to mitigate this issue. However, when the search engine is triggered for harmful tasks, the outcome is no longer under the LLM's control. Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful takeaways, the LLM's safeguards cannot withdraw that exposure. Motivated by this dilemma, we identify web search as a critical attack surface and propose \textbf{\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming. SearchAttack outsources the harmful semantics to web search, retaining only the query's skeleton and fragmented clues, and further steers LLMs to reconstruct the retrieved content via structural rubrics to achieve malicious goals. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment. Empirically, SearchAttack demonstrates strong effectiveness in attacking these systems.

*Maryam Rahimi,Mahdi Nouri,Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes positional biases in language models, introducing an attribution-based framework to study how layers distribute importance across input positions, revealing architecture-specific biases like recency and primacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work has not fully explored how positional biases evolve across layers and positions in language models, especially independent of task complexity. This gap motivates the study.

Method: An attribution-based framework using layer conductance and a sliding-window approach is introduced to quantify positional importance profiles across layers.

Result: Findings show architecture-specific, stable positional profiles with increasing recency bias and diminishing primacy bias as layers deepen. Early layers also prefer content words.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how positional and word-type biases vary across layers, highlighting the stability and architecture-dependence of these biases.

Abstract: Language models often show a preference for using information from specific positions in the input regardless of semantic relevance. While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextFocus is a lightweight activation steering approach that enhances LLM faithfulness to retrieved context during knowledge conflicts, without finetuning or significant overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often default to memorized facts when external context conflicts with their parametric knowledge, leading to unfaithful outputs.

Method: Introduces ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering method requiring no finetuning or substantial inference-time overhead.

Result: Outperforms baselines like ContextDPO and COIECD on ConFiQA, showing significant improvements in contextual-faithfulness while maintaining fluency and efficiency.

Conclusion: ContextFocus is effective, robust, and efficient for improving LLM contextual-faithfulness, complementing existing prompting strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of parametric knowledge during pre-training. As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve large language models' ability to detect financial misinformation in real-world news, focusing on contextual complexity.

Method: RFC Bench defines two tasks: reference-free misinformation detection and comparison-based diagnosis using paired original and perturbed inputs.

Result: Models perform better with comparative context but show weaknesses (e.g., unstable predictions) in reference-free settings, indicating difficulty in maintaining coherent belief states.

Conclusion: RFC Bench identifies gaps in reference-free reasoning for financial misinformation detection, offering a structured testbed for future improvements.

Abstract: We introduce RFC Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on financial misinformation under realistic news. RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding. By highlighting this gap, RFC Bench provides a structured testbed for studying reference free reasoning and advancing more reliable financial misinformation detection in real world settings.

TL;DR: PC2P is a novel distributed MAPF method using MARL and Q-learning, featuring personalized communication, local perception, and a deadlock-breaking strategy, outperforming existing methods in diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed MAPF methods struggle with scalability and collaboration in partially observable environments due to limited perceptual and cooperative capabilities.

Method: PC2P integrates a Q-learning-based MARL framework with a dynamic graph communication mechanism, local crowd perception, and a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy.

Result: PC2P outperforms state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its modules.

Conclusion: PC2P advances distributed MAPF by enhancing communication, perception, and deadlock resolution, proving effective across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Distributed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) integrated with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent research focus, enabling real-time cooperative decision-making in partially observable environments through inter-agent communication. However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who" and ``what" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.

Motivation: To systematize and evaluate emerging design patterns for LLM-enabled MAS, demonstrating their practical benefits and limitations.

Method: Defines architectural components (agent orchestration, communication, control-flow) and tests them in three real-world case studies via controlled pilots.

Result: Prototypes were delivered in two weeks and pilot-ready solutions in one month, showing reduced development overhead and improved accessibility, but recognized LLM behavior variability challenges.

Conclusion: Proposes future research to enhance MAS reliability, scalability, and governance, addressing inherent challenges in transitioning prototypes to production.

Abstract: This paper formalises the literature on emerging design patterns and paradigms for Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled multi-agent systems (MAS), evaluating their practical utility across various domains. We define key architectural components, including agent orchestration, communication mechanisms, and control-flow strategies, and demonstrate how these enable rapid development of modular, domain-adaptive solutions. Three real-world case studies are tested in controlled, containerised pilots in telecommunications security, national heritage asset management, and utilities customer service automation. Initial empirical results show that, for these case studies, prototypes were delivered within two weeks and pilot-ready solutions within one month, suggesting reduced development overhead compared to conventional approaches and improved user accessibility. However, findings also reinforce limitations documented in the literature, including variability in LLM behaviour that leads to challenges in transitioning from prototype to production maturity. We conclude by outlining critical research directions for improving reliability, scalability, and governance in MAS architectures and the further work needed to mature MAS design patterns to mitigate the inherent challenges.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Chromatographic separation technology has been widely applied in pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries due to its high efficiency. However, traditional human-dependent chromatographic process development faces challenges such as reliance on expert experience, long development cycles, and labor intensity. ChromR, a large language model (LLM)-driven platform for chromatographic process design and optimization, is presented in this work. The platform integrates ChromLLM, a domain-specific LLM trained for chromatography, along with a multi-agent system and an automated chromatographic experimental device. The multi-agent system comprises four agents: domain knowledge answering, experimental design, experimental execution, and data analysis. ChromR enables automatic completion of the entire workflow-including initial process parameter recommendation, experimental design, automated execution, data analysis, and multi-objective optimization. By utilizing ChromR, dependency on expert knowledge is effectively reduced, while labor input and development time are significantly decreased. Chromatographic purification of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaf (EGBL) was selected as a case study. ChromR successfully developed a chromatographic process within one week that meets multiple objectives, including fraction quality and production efficiency, reducing development time to approximately one-seventh of that required by the conventional paradigm. An intelligent, automated, and universally applicable new paradigm was established for chromatographic process development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how interacting LLM-based agents coordinate implicitly via covert signals, beyond explicit communication.

Method: Analyzes interactions in four game-theoretic settings under varying communication regimes (explicit, restricted, absent), considering agent personalities and game repetition.

Result: Identifies conditions for covert signal emergence and their influence on coordination and strategic outcomes.

Conclusion: Covert communication plays a significant role in multi-agent systems, impacting strategic behavior and coordination.

Abstract: LLMs-based agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments where strategic interaction and coordination are required. While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.

Motivation: Enable real-time AI on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Analyzes techniques like quantization, pruning, distillation, reviews models (MobileBERT, TinyBERT, etc.), benchmarks on datasets (GLUE, ImageNet).

Result: Lightweight transformers achieve 75-96% accuracy, reduce size by 4-10x, latency by 3-9x, and fit 2-5W devices.

Conclusion: Identifies optimal strategies (sparse attention, quantization), bottlenecks, and provides a deployment pipeline for edge AI.

Abstract: The deployment of transformer-based models on resource-constrained edge devices represents a critical challenge in enabling real-time artificial intelligence applications. This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces R²VPO, a novel RL method replacing hard policy ratio clipping with a variance constraint to improve stability and data efficiency in fine-tuning LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard clipping in RL methods like PPO and GRPO suppresses valuable gradients and wastes stale data, limiting efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes R²VPO, a primal-dual framework constraining policy ratio variance, enabling stable updates and off-policy data reuse.

Result: R²VPO outperforms clipping-based methods by up to 17% in performance and reduces rollout samples by 50% for convergence.

Conclusion: Ratio-variance control enhances RL-based LLM alignment stability and efficiency, validated across benchmarks.

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has become the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative "eureka moments" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for self-consistent radiology report generation using MLLMs, optimizing vision and language components to reduce hallucinations and improve clinical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical translation of MLLMs for radiology reports is limited by architectural heterogeneity and factual hallucinations. Current methods lack strict alignment between visual evidence and linguistic outputs.

Method: The framework includes systematic evaluation of vision encoders and LLM backbones, followed by a 'Reason-then-Summarize' architecture optimized via GRPO. It uses a multi-dimensional reward function to penalize logical discrepancies.

Result: Experiments on MIMIC-CXR show state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy and significant reduction in hallucinations compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses key challenges in radiology report generation, offering improved accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel "Reason-then-Summarize" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.

TL;DR: HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network, improves EEG-based brain-computer interfaces by capturing hierarchical EEG structure and enhancing generalization through domain-invariant embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG decoding suffers from poor generalization due to domain shifts (e.g., across subjects). Robust hierarchical representations could mitigate this, leveraging hyperbolic geometry as it suits hierarchical data.

Method: Proposes HEEGNet, combining Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders with a coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy to learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings.

Result: Demonstrates EEG hyperbolicity and shows HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple EEG datasets (visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, intracranial EEG).

Conclusion: Hyperbolic embeddings enhance EEG decoding generalization; HEEGNet effectively captures hierarchical EEG structure and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces facilitate direct communication with a computer, enabling promising applications in human-computer interactions. However, their utility is currently limited because EEG decoding often suffers from poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains (e.g., subjects). Learning robust representations that capture underlying task-relevant information would mitigate these shifts and improve generalization. One promising approach is to exploit the underlying hierarchical structure in EEG, as recent studies suggest that hierarchical cognitive processes, such as visual processing, can be encoded in EEG. While many decoding methods still rely on Euclidean embeddings, recent work has begun exploring hyperbolic geometry for EEG. Hyperbolic spaces, regarded as the continuous analogue of tree structures, provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we first empirically demonstrate that EEG data exhibit hyperbolicity and show that hyperbolic embeddings improve generalization. Motivated by these findings, we propose HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network architecture to capture the hierarchical structure in EEG and learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings. To this end, HEEGNet combines both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders and employs a novel coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple public EEG datasets, covering visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, and intracranial EEG, demonstrate that HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an ordinal classification framework for wildfire severity prediction in France, focusing on loss-function design to improve forecasting of rare high-severity events. Ordinal-aware objectives outperform standard methods, particularly Weighted Kappa Loss, but rare events remain challenging due to data imbalance. Future work aims to integrate seasonality and uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfires are spatially and severity-imbalanced natural hazards, making extreme events hard to predict. The study addresses the need for a framework aligned with operational decision-making in France, emphasizing the role of loss-function design in improving predictions for rare high-severity fires.

Method: The study evaluates neural models using standard cross-entropy and ordinal-aware loss functions, including a proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss. Benchmarking is conducted over multiple architectures and real operational data.

Result: Ordinal supervision significantly improves model performance, with Weighted Kappa Loss achieving the best results (+0.1 IoU gain for extreme severity classes). However, performance for rarest events remains limited due to data imbalance.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of ordinality, data imbalance, and seasonality in wildfire forecasting. Future research will explore seasonal dynamics and uncertainty integration to enhance extreme-event prediction reliability.

Abstract: Wildfires are highly imbalanced natural hazards in both space and severity, making the prediction of extreme events particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.

Result: Empirical insights into training dynamics, scaling laws, attention patterns, and performance benchmarks.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of attention mechanisms but acknowledges challenges in scalability, data efficiency, generalization, and interpretability.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms represent a fundamental paradigm shift in neural network architectures, enabling models to selectively focus on relevant portions of input sequences through learned weighting functions. This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.

### [187] [LUT-KAN: Segment-wise LUT Quantization for Fast KAN Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03332)
*Oleksandr Kuznetsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LUT-KAN introduces a segment-wise lookup-table method for Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KAN) to improve CPU inference efficiency by replacing costly B-spline evaluations with LUTs and quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost of KAN layers due to repeated spline evaluations and the difficulty of applying standard quantization tools.

Method: The method involves converting edge functions into per-segment LUTs with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation, ensuring reproducibility and explicit inference contracts.

Result: LUT-KAN reduces CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba while maintaining accuracy (F1 drop below 0.0002) and introducing manageable memory overhead (~10x).

Conclusion: LUT-KAN successfully balances accuracy and efficiency for KAN layers, offering a practical solution for deploying such models on CPU with reproducible and optimized performance.

Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KAN) replace scalar weights by learnable univariate functions, often implemented with B-splines. This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts. The compiled model preserves classification quality (F1 drop below 0.0002) while reducing steady-state CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba backends (honest baseline). The memory overhead is approximately 10x at L=64. All code and artifacts are publicly available with fixed release tags for reproducibility.

TL;DR: This paper presents a physics-informed framework replacing the empirical failure surface in the KCC model with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression surrogate, improving accuracy and reliability while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of flexibility and uncertainty quantification in widely used phenomenological models like the Karagozian & Case concrete (KCC) model.

Method: Develops a physics-informed framework using constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) trained on triaxial compression data, incorporating derivative-based constraints.

Result: The physics-informed GPR outperforms unconstrained GPR in accuracy and reliability, especially under extrapolation, and reduces predictive variance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that enhances generalization and simplifies calibration without losing interpretability.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling the constitutive behavior of concrete is crucial for civil and defense applications, yet widely used phenomenological models such as Karagozian \& Case concrete (KCC) model depend on empirically calibrated failure surfaces that lack flexibility in model form and associated uncertainty quantification. This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of CNNs requiring large labeled datasets by exploring quantum computing for better feature extraction on small datasets.

Method: Introduce projected quantum kernels (PQK) into CNNs to enhance feature extraction, specifically for small datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.

Result: PQK-enhanced CNNs achieved 95% accuracy on MNIST and 90% on CIFAR-10 with 1000 samples, far surpassing traditional CNNs (60% and 12%, respectively).

Conclusion: Projected quantum kernels show promise in overcoming data scarcity for CNNs, opening avenues for quantum-assisted neural networks in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in efficiency and accuracy in image classification. However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments.

TL;DR: A novel framework uses weather-aware deep learning models to accelerate drone route prediction, outperforming classical algorithms like A* and Dijkstra in real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional path-planning algorithms lack real-time efficiency in dynamic environments, especially under adverse weather conditions.

Method: The approach trains transformer-based and attention-based models on synthetic datasets, incorporating weather heuristics to dynamically weight environmental factors.

Result: Weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup while maintaining optimal route performance, with transformers excelling in dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: The framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization, enhancing efficiency and safety in autonomous drone operations.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate route prediction in Drone-as-a-Service operations through weather-aware deep learning models. While classical path-planning algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems.

TL;DR: SIGMA is a framework using spectral analysis of Gram matrices to quantify and predict model collapse in LLMs, offering scalable solutions for large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of model collapse in LLMs trained on synthetic data, where recursive training reduces distributional variance and quality.

Method: Introduced SIGMA, leveraging spectral inequalities of Gram matrices to derive deterministic and stochastic bounds for tracking representation space contraction.

Result: SIGMA effectively identifies degenerate states in models, providing theoretical insights and scalable monitoring tools.

Conclusion: SIGMA offers a mathematically grounded and practical approach to detect and mitigate model collapse in LLM training pipelines.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of synthetic data for training Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the technical challenge of "model collapse"-a degenerative process where recursive training on model-generated content leads to a contraction of distributional variance and representational quality. While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.

TL;DR: PanSubNet is a deep learning framework that predicts pancreatic cancer subtypes from H&E-stained slides, offering clinical utility with high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for PDAC subtyping are costly and time-consuming, limiting clinical use. PanSubNet aims to provide a rapid, cost-effective solution.

Method: Uses dual-scale architecture to analyze cellular and tissue-level features in H&E slides, validated on multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN and TCGA).

Result: Achieved high AUC scores (88.5% internally, 84.0% externally) and preserved prognostic stratification, aligning with transcriptomic data.

Conclusion: PanSubNet is a deployable tool for PDAC subtyping, enhancing precision oncology with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Molecular subtyping of PDAC into basal-like and classical has established prognostic and predictive value. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping. We are gathering data from two institutions to validate and assess real-world performance, supporting integration into digital pathology workflows and advancing precision oncology for PDAC.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized multi-agent control, achieving high convergence rates comparable to existing neural network frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning methods, which rely on handcrafted features or raw vectors, hindering scalability and efficiency.

Method: Introduces an image-based reinforcement learning approach where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs processed by Neural Networks, enabling decentralized motion control rules.

Result: Achieves high convergence rates in a multi-agent aggregation task, performing nearly as fast as VariAntNet and outperforming an analytical benchmark in certain scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed image-based method is effective for decentralized swarm control, offering practical advantages in speed and success rates over existing approaches.

Abstract: This study highlights the potential of image-based reinforcement learning methods for addressing swarm-related tasks. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.

*Zhakshylyk Nurlanov,Frank R. Schmidt,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAILS is a framework for adversarial jailbreak attacks on LLMs, using token-level iterative optimization without gradients or priors. It achieves high success rates and transferability to closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously evaluate LLM robustness against adversarial jailbreaks, overcoming limitations of existing automated attacks that rely on handcrafted priors or white-box access.

Method: Introduces RAILS, a framework using token-level iterative optimization on model logits. Key innovations include an auto-regressive loss for exact prefix matching and a history-based selection strategy.

Result: RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on open-source models and high transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.

Conclusion: RAILS demonstrates effective adversarial jailbreak attacks without gradients or priors, enhancing robustness evaluation for LLMs.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, rigorously evaluating their robustness against adversarial jailbreaks is essential. However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.

TL;DR: A training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra reveals stable spectral fingerprints in models, exposing discontinuities like Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse (PTCC) and identifying processing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral benchmarks only show what models do, not how they work. The study aims to understand the mechanistic aspects of model behavior using attention-graph spectra.

Method: The study uses attention-graph spectra to compute algebraic connectivity, smoothness, and spectral entropy for each layer of 12 models across 10 languages.

Result: Results include the discovery of PTCC, a specialization trade-off, identification of recurrent processing strategies, and localization of PTCC to a specific layer. Activation steering partially restores connectivity.

Conclusion: Attention-graph spectra are practical for auditing models and verifying training regimes, with findings suggesting 'healthy' geometry varies by script rather than language.

Abstract: Behavioral benchmarks tell us \textit{what} a model does, but not \textit{how}. We introduce a training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra. Treating each layer as a token graph, we compute algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$), smoothness, and spectral entropy. Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation.
  We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $Δλ_2 \approx -0.76$. We term this scar \textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\approx 38\%$ of lost information flow.
  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that Mixture of Experts models specialize domains through sparse routing, revealing a domain-invariant Standing Committee of experts that dominates routing across layers and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Mixture of Experts models truly achieve domain specialization via sparse routing or if there's inherent structural bias.

Method: Introduces COMMITTEEAUDIT, a framework analyzing routing behavior at expert-group level across three models and MMLU benchmark.

Result: Identifies a Standing Committee—experts consistently handling majority of routing, anchoring reasoning/syntax, while others handle domain specifics.

Conclusion: Current training objectives (e.g., load-balancing losses) may conflict with natural optimization, limiting efficiency; specialization is less pervasive than assumed.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.

TL;DR: VNU-Bench is introduced as the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video news understanding, testing models' ability to compare and synthesize multimodal news from different sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single-source reasoning, while real-world news consumption involves multi-source comparisons, requiring models to align and synthesize information across sources.

Method: A novel hybrid human-model QA generation process is used to create a scalable, high-quality dataset with 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 questions.

Result: VNU-Bench proves challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), highlighting their limitations in multi-source understanding.

Conclusion: The benchmark addresses a critical gap in evaluating models for robust multi-source news understanding, emphasizing the need for improved multimodal synthesis and comparison capabilities.

Abstract: News videos are carefully edited multimodal narratives that combine narration, visuals, and external quotations into coherent storylines. In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions. Comprehensive evaluation of both closed- and open-source multimodal models shows that VNU-Bench poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs.

Motivation: Addresses the real-world challenge of classifying text into user-specified, previously unseen classes.

Method: Uses a soft-contextualized encoder that contextualizes candidate labels with the label set and input query.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution and unseen benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture generalizes well and outperforms baselines across diverse datasets.

Abstract: User-Defined Text Classification (UDTC) considers the challenge of classifying input text to user-specified, previously unseen classes, a setting that arises frequently in real-world applications such as enterprise analytics, content moderation, and domain-specific information retrieval. We propose a soft-contextualized encoder architecture for UDTC which contextualizes each candidate label with the label set and a static soft prompt representation of the input query. Training on diverse, multi-source datasets enables the model to generalize effectively to zero-shot classification over entirely unseen topic sets drawn from arbitrary domains. We evaluate the proposed architecture both on held-out in-distribution test data and on multiple unseen UDTC benchmarks. Across datasets, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming or matching the baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of imputing missing target variables in shifted deployment domains using a Gaussian causal DAG from a fully observed source domain.

Method: Proposes a first-order EM operator with projected gradient steps, leverages DAG structure to freeze invariant mechanisms, and re-estimates shift-affected distributions for scalability.

Result: Demonstrates geometric convergence, finite-sample guarantees, and superior imputation accuracy over baselines in synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm effectively transfers information and improves imputation accuracy, especially under significant domain shifts.

Abstract: We study the problem of imputing a designated target variable that is systematically missing in a shifted deployment domain, when a Gaussian causal DAG is available from a fully observed source domain. We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of low feature optimization and lack of interpretability in existing machine learning and deep learning approaches for driver behavior analytics.

Method: Uses a dataset from Kaggle, applies preprocessing techniques (label encoding, oversampling, scaling), tests 13 ML algorithms, and employs LIME for feature importance analysis.

Result: Random Forest Classifier initially achieves 95% accuracy, slightly dropping to 94.2% after feature optimization with LIME, maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: The hybrid model balances predictive power and explainability, offering practical benefits for driver behavior analysis.

Abstract: Progressive driver behavior analytics is crucial for improving road safety and mitigating the issues caused by aggressive or inattentive driving. Previous studies have employed machine learning and deep learning techniques, which often result in low feature optimization, thereby compromising both high performance and interpretability. To fill these voids, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis that uses a 12,857-row and 18-column data set taken from Kaggle. After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%. After deploying the LIME technique in XAI, the top 10 features with the most significant positive and negative influence on accuracy were identified, and the same algorithms were retrained. The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier decreased slightly to 94.2%, confirming that the efficiency of the model can be improved without sacrificing performance. This hybrid model can provide a return on investment in terms of the predictive power and explainability of the driver behavior process.

TL;DR: HAQA is an automated framework using LLMs to simplify quantization and deployment, improving speed, accuracy, and ease of use across hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource constraints and deployment complexities hinder broader adoption of large language models, especially for non-experts.

Method: Leverages LLMs for automated hyperparameter tuning and hardware-aware quantization.

Result: Achieves up to 2.3x inference speedup, higher throughput, and better accuracy on Llama.

Conclusion: HAQA reduces manual effort and enhances adaptability, making quantization accessible to more users.

Abstract: Deploying models, especially large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly attractive to a broader user base, including those without specialized expertise. However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability.

*Longwen Wang,Xuan'er Wu,Xiaohui Hu,Yirui Liu,Yuankai Fan,Kaidong Yu,Qizhen Weng,Wei Xi,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VeRPO is a novel RL framework for code generation that uses verifiable execution feedback to create dense rewards, outperforming traditional pass/fail and RM-based methods with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward designs in RL for code generation suffer from sparsity (pass/fail rewards) or misalignment and high computational costs (RM-based rewards). VeRPO aims to address these issues by deriving dense rewards from verifiable execution feedback.

Method: VeRPO synthesizes dense rewards from weighted partial success by dynamically estimating the difficulty of unit tests during training. It combines these rewards with global execution outcomes to ensure alignment with functional correctness.

Result: VeRPO outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to +8.83% improvement in pass@1 with negligible computational overhead (< 0.02% time cost and zero GPU memory usage).

Conclusion: VeRPO offers a robust and efficient reward paradigm for RL in code generation, leveraging verifiable execution feedback to enhance performance without significant computational burden.

Abstract: Effective reward design is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for code generation. Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains. While recent work has explored external Reward Models (RM) to generate richer, continuous rewards, the learned RMs suffer from reward misalignment and prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{VeRPO} (\textbf{V}erifiable D\textbf{e}nse \textbf{R}eward \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.

*Hao Tang,Hao Chen,Hao Li,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a designable Green's function framework (DGF) and proposes Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) to address the challenge of balancing spherical geometric biases with real-world heterogeneity. GSNO fuses three operator solutions for symmetry, invariance, and anisotropy, showcasing superior performance across various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spherical deep learning approaches struggle to balance geometric inductive biases with real-world heterogeneity. The paper aims to solve this while retaining spherical geometry.

Method: The authors introduce DGF for designing Green's functions under rotational groups and propose GSNO, which combines three operator solutions: equivariant, invariant, and anisotropic.

Result: GSNO demonstrates superior performance on tasks like spherical MNIST, Shallow Water Equation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, cortical parcellation, and molecule structure modeling.

Conclusion: GSNO effectively adapts to heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while maintaining spectral efficiency, proving its versatility and superiority in various applications.

Abstract: Spherical deep learning has been widely applied to a broad range of real-world problems. Existing approaches often face challenges in balancing strong spherical geometric inductive biases with the need to model real-world heterogeneity. To solve this while retaining spherical geometry, we first introduce a designable Green's function framework (DGF) to provide new spherical operator solution strategy: Design systematic Green's functions under rotational group. Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting model, GSNO can adapt to real-world heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while retaining spectral efficiency. Evaluations on spherical MNIST, Shallow Water Equation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, cortical parcellation and molecule structure modeling demonstrate the superiority of GSNO.

*Vaibhav Gupta,Florian Grensing,Beyza Cinar,Maria Maleshkova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores improving hypoglycemia prediction in diabetes management by addressing data gaps and noise in wearable sensor data, proposing tailored imputation techniques for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic diseases like diabetes require timely intervention for complications such as hypoglycemia, but noisy and incomplete wearable sensor data hinder effective prediction.

Method: The study analyzes existing datasets, temporal feature characteristics, and evaluates imputation techniques from ML/DL studies to propose feature-specific strategies for filling data gaps.

Result: A systematic paradigm is introduced, adapting imputation methods based on feature nature and missing data duration to improve prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Effective hypoglycemia prediction relies on understanding temporal feature dynamics and employing multiple, tailored imputation techniques for heterogeneous data patterns.

Abstract: Chronic diseases such as diabetes pose significant management challenges, particularly due to the risk of complications like hypoglycemia, which require timely detection and intervention. Continuous health monitoring through wearable sensors offers a promising solution for early prediction of glycemic events. However, effective use of multisensor data is hindered by issues such as signal noise and frequent missing values. This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.

### [205] [Local Intrinsic Dimensionality of Ground Motion Data for Early Detection of Complex Catastrophic Slope Failure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03569)
*Yuansan Liu,Antoinette Tordesillas,James Bailey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes stLID, a spatiotemporal LID method enhancing anomaly detection in landslides by integrating velocity, spatial correlations, and temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack the ability to capture spatial correlations and temporal dynamics in landslide data, limiting early and accurate failure detection.

Method: Extends sLID with kinematic enhancement (velocity), spatial fusion (Bayesian estimation), and temporal modeling (tLID), integrating them into stLID.

Result: stLID outperforms existing methods in detection precision and lead-time for landslide failures.

Conclusion: The unified stLID framework effectively addresses spatial and temporal gaps in landslide failure detection, improving accuracy and timeliness.

Abstract: Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) has shown strong potential for identifying anomalies and outliers in high-dimensional data across a wide range of real-world applications, including landslide failure detection in granular media. Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.

### [206] [Variational Inference, Entropy, and Orthogonality: A Unified Theory of Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03577)
*Ye Su,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified theoretical framework for Mixture-of-Experts models, deriving Top-k routing and load balancing as optimal solutions from Bayesian and information-theoretic perspectives, and addresses routing challenges like combinatorial hardness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a cohesive theoretical foundation for the heuristic mechanisms (Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing) in Mixture-of-Experts models and address their inherent combinatorial hardness.

Method: Develops a theoretical framework combining Bayesian posterior approximation and information-theoretic principles, focusing on routing ambiguity minimization and channel capacity maximization. Introduces orthogonality regularization.

Result: Proves the 'Coherence Barrier' and shows that orthogonality regularization bridges the gap between NP-hard global routing optimization and greedy approximations.

Conclusion: The work offers theoretical and technical insights for improving MoE designs, emphasizing orthogonality regularization for scalable models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models enable large language models to scale efficiently, as they only activate a subset of experts for each input. Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a "Coherence Barrier"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation. Our comparative analyses confirm orthogonality regularization as the optimal engineering relaxation for large-scale models. Our work offers essential theoretical support and technical assurance for a deeper understanding and novel designs of MoE.

### [207] [Local Gradient Regulation Stabilizes Federated Learning under Client Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03584)
*Ping Luo,Jiahuan Wang,Ziqing Wen,Tao Sun,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies client heterogeneity as a destabilizing factor in federated learning (FL) due to distorted local gradient dynamics. It proposes Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR) to regulate gradients and stabilize FL without extra communication. Results show improved stability across methods and datasets like LC25000.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of statistical heterogeneity destabilizing FL by distorting local gradient dynamics, leading to systematic drift and hindered global convergence.

Method: Develops ECGR, a client-side approach inspired by swarm intelligence, to regulate local gradients by balancing aligned and misaligned components.

Result: Demonstrates that regulating local gradients stabilizes FL across state-of-the-art methods and heterogeneous datasets, validated theoretically and experimentally.

Conclusion: Local gradient regulation is crucial for stabilizing FL under heterogeneity, with ECGR providing an effective and communication-efficient solution.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its stability is fundamentally challenged by statistical heterogeneity in realistic deployments. Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.

### [208] [ALERT: Zero-shot LLM Jailbreak Detection via Internal Discrepancy Amplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03600)
*Xiao Lin,Philip Li,Zhichen Zeng,Tingwei Li,Tianxin Wei,Xuying Ning,Gaotang Li,Yuzhong Chen,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALERT is a zero-shot jailbreak detection framework that amplifies internal feature discrepancies in LLMs to identify jailbreak attacks without relying on pre-existing templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods depend on jailbreak templates in training data, failing to address the more realistic zero-shot setting where new attacks evolve continuously.

Method: ALERT uses a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework to uncover safety-relevant layers, modules, and tokens, then applies two complementary classifiers on amplified representations.

Result: ALERT ranks top two across datasets and attack strategies, outperforming baselines by 10-40% in Accuracy and F1-score.

Conclusion: ALERT effectively addresses zero-shot jailbreak detection challenges, offering strong performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.

*Kaidong Feng,Zhu Sun,Roy Ka-Wei Lee,Xun Jiang,Yin-Leng Theng,Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks ML, DL, and LLM approaches for forecasting mental health using smartphone data, finding DL models like Transformers perform best overall, while personalization enhances forecasts for severe states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable proactive mental health support by forecasting conditions using smartphone sensing data, advancing beyond detection-focused studies.

Method: Comparative benchmarking of ML, DL (including Transformers), and LLMs on the CES dataset, evaluating temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization, and class imbalance handling.

Result: DL models (e.g., Transformers) achieved the best performance (Macro-F1 = 0.58), LLMs excelled in contextual reasoning but lagged in temporal modeling, and personalization improved forecasts for severe states.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for developing adaptive, human-centered mental health technologies, highlighting DL's superiority and personalization's value.

Abstract: Smartphone sensing offers an unobtrusive and scalable way to track daily behaviors linked to mental health, capturing changes in sleep, mobility, and phone use that often precede symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression. While most prior studies focus on detection that responds to existing conditions, forecasting mental health enables proactive support through Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling. Personalization substantially improves forecasts of severe mental health states. By revealing how different modeling approaches interpret phone sensing behavioral data over time, this work lays the groundwork for next-generation, adaptive, and human-centered mental health technologies that can advance both research and real-world well-being.

### [210] [Policy-Guided Search on Tree-of-Thoughts for Efficient Problem Solving with Bounded Language Model Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03606)
*Sumedh Pendurkar,Guni Sharon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper integrates Levin Tree Search (LTS) with Language Models (LM) in the Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework to reduce computational costs while maintaining problem-solving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational costs of LM inference in constrained budgets by leveraging LM probabilities as heuristics for efficient search.

Method: Adapt LTS to ToT, using LM-guided tree exploration and theoretical analysis of state expansion bounds.

Result: LTS achieves comparable/higher accuracy than baselines under fixed query budgets across multiple domains and LMs.

Conclusion: LTS enables cost-effective, time-efficient problem-solving, suitable for latency-critical applications.

Abstract: Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.

We provide rigorous mathematical proofs using information theory (negligible loss bounded at 0.153 bits), Rademacher complexity (28.09% tighter generalization bound), and category theory to demonstrate improved stability and generalization. Empirical results show a 9.47% reduction in validation loss, confirmed by SVD analysis and an expert listening study (N=53). This dual theoretical and applied framework bridges gaps in AI music generation, offering verifiable insights for mathematically grounded deep learning.

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias correction in simulator outputs for routing decisions using limited real-world data and edge-similarity structures, proposing Laplacian-regularized estimation and active learning for accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve routing decisions in large-scale networks by addressing systematic bias in simulator outputs, leveraging scarce real-world data and edge-similarity structures.

Method: Uses Laplacian-regularized least squares to estimate edge-specific biases smoothly varying over a similarity graph, and proposes a bias-aware active learning algorithm for cold-start settings.

Result: Demonstrates calibrated edge cost estimation even with limited data, provides finite-sample error bounds, and verifies near-optimal routes through data-driven certificates.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively correct simulator bias and optimize routing decisions, validated through numerical experiments on road and traffic networks.

Abstract: Digital twins and other simulators are increasingly used to support routing decisions in large-scale networks. However, simulator outputs often exhibit systematic bias, while ground-truth measurements are costly and scarce. We study a stochastic shortest-path problem in which a planner has access to abundant synthetic samples, limited real-world observations, and an edge-similarity structure capturing expected behavioral similarity across links. We model the simulator-to-reality discrepancy as an unknown, edge-specific bias that varies smoothly over the similarity graph, and estimate it using Laplacian-regularized least squares. This approach yields calibrated edge cost estimates even in data-scarce regimes. We establish finite-sample error bounds, translate estimation error into path-level suboptimality guarantees, and propose a computable, data-driven certificate that verifies near-optimality of a candidate route. For cold-start settings without initial real data, we develop a bias-aware active learning algorithm that leverages the simulator and adaptively selects edges to measure until a prescribed accuracy is met. Numerical experiments on multiple road networks and traffic graphs further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

TL;DR: A new class of stochastic neural network operators (K-SNNOs) is introduced for approximating random dynamics, featuring stochastic neurons driven by stochastic integrators. The method ensures mean-square convergence and provides quantitative error estimates, validated by simulations showing accurate reconstruction and rapid MSE decay.


<details>

Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in extending artificial neural network operators (ANNOs) to random dynamics, proposing a framework that incorporates randomness through stochastic neurons to model stochastic signals effectively.

Method: The authors construct Kantorovich-type Stochastic Neural Network Operators (K-SNNOs) with stochastic neurons driven by stochastic integrators, ensuring the operator inherits the probabilistic structure of the underlying process.

Result: Mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process is established, with quantitative error estimates provided. Numerical simulations confirm accurate sample path reconstruction and fast MSE decay.

Conclusion: The proposed K-SNNOs are robust and effective for modeling stochastic signals, demonstrated by theoretical convergence proofs and empirical validation through simulations.

Abstract: Artificial neural network operators (ANNOs) have been widely used for approximating deterministic input-output functions; however, their extension to random dynamics remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we construct a new class of \textbf{Kantorovich-type Stochastic Neural Network Operators (K-SNNOs)} in which randomness is incorporated not at the coefficient level, but through \textbf{stochastic neurons} driven by stochastic integrators. This framework enables the operator to inherit the probabilistic structure of the underlying process, making it suitable for modeling and approximating stochastic signals. We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity. Numerical simulations further validate the theoretical results by demonstrating accurate reconstruction of sample paths and rapid decay of the mean square error (MSE). Graphical results, including sample-wise approximations and empirical MSE behaviour, illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed stochastic-neuron-based operator.

TL;DR: ReLA, a reinforcement-learning scheduler, improves job scheduling efficiency and quality using structured representation learning and aggregation, outperforming existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing job scheduling solutions suffer from long running times and poor schedule quality, especially at larger scales, prompting the need for a more efficient method.

Method: ReLA uses self-attention, convolution, and cross-attention modules to learn representations of scheduling entities, aggregated in a multi-scale architecture for RL decision-making.

Result: ReLA achieves the best makespan in most settings, reducing optimality gaps by 13.0% (non-large instances) and 78.6% (large-scale instances).

Conclusion: ReLA's approach effectively supports RL scheduling, enabling faster job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.

Abstract: Job scheduling is widely used in real-world manufacturing systems to assign ordered job operations to machines under various constraints. Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opacity of foundation models by investigating if certain neurons inherently respond to single, interpretable concepts.

Method: Proposes two information-theoretic measures for neuronal saliency and selectivity, applied to TabPFN, a tabular foundation model.

Result: Some neurons exhibited moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts.

Conclusion: Interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and be identified without complex techniques, enhancing model transparency.

Abstract: Foundation models are powerful yet often opaque in their decision-making. A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.

TL;DR: GESCL is a regularization-based method for continual learning in CNNs that prevents catastrophic forgetting by balancing stability and plasticity, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for fixed-capacity CNNs without expanding the network or memorizing past data.

Method: GESCL uses stability regularization to preserve important filters for past tasks and plasticity regularization to sparsify unimportant filters for future tasks.

Result: GESCL achieves higher classification accuracy and better avoids catastrophic forgetting compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GESCL is an efficient and effective approach for continual learning in CNNs.

Abstract: We present a regularization-based approach for continual learning (CL) of fixed capacity convolutional neural networks (CNN) that does not suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially. This method referred to as Group and Exclusive Sparsity based Continual Learning (GESCL) avoids forgetting of previous tasks by ensuring the stability of the CNN via a stability regularization term, which prevents filters detected as important for past tasks to deviate too much when learning a new task. On top of that, GESCL makes the network plastic via a plasticity regularization term that leverage the over-parameterization of CNNs to efficiently sparsify the network and tunes unimportant filters making them relevant for future tasks. Doing so, GESCL deals with significantly less parameters and computation compared to CL approaches that either dynamically expand the network or memorize past tasks' data. Experiments on popular CL vision benchmarks show that GESCL leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art method in terms of overall CL performance, as measured by classification accuracy as well as in terms of avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Motivation: Existing GRPO methods suffer from biases and underutilize reward rankings, limiting their effectiveness in reasoning-heavy tasks.

Method: AMIR-GRPO introduces a contrastive regularizer using intra-group reward rankings without extra annotations, improving supervision.

Result: AMIR-GRPO outperforms GRPO benchmarks, enhances reasoning chain separation, and expands solution coverage.

Conclusion: AMIR-GRPO effectively addresses GRPO's limitations and improves LLM alignment for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the primary paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) widely used in large-scale post-training. However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.
  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AMIR-GRPO consistently outperforms strong GRPO baselines, yields clearer separation between correct and incorrect reasoning chains, and delivers broader coverage gains beyond the subset of instances solved by standard GRPO.

### [219] [Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03664)
*Yang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVEAD is a novel anomaly detection method using stochastic Voronoi ensembles, overcoming limitations of existing methods with linear time complexity and outperforming 12 state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods fail with varying local densities—distance-based miss local anomalies, while density-based require complex parameter tuning and have high computational cost.

Method: SVEAD decomposes data into random Voronoi regions, scoring anomalies using normalized cell-relative distances weighted by local scale.

Result: Achieves linear time complexity and constant space complexity, outperforming 12 benchmarks on 45 datasets.

Conclusion: SVEAD effectively identifies local anomalies by leveraging geometric insights into decomposed regions, offering computational efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly detection aims to identify data instances that deviate significantly from majority of data, which has been widely used in fraud detection, network security, and industrial quality control. Existing methods struggle with datasets exhibiting varying local densities: distance-based methods miss local anomalies, while density-based approaches require careful parameter selection and incur quadratic time complexity. We observe that local anomalies, though indistinguishable under global analysis, become conspicuous when the data space is decomposed into restricted regions and each region is examined independently. Leveraging this geometric insight, we propose SVEAD (Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles Anomaly Detector), which constructs ensemble random Voronoi diagrams and scores points by normalized cell-relative distances weighted by local scale. The proposed method achieves linear time complexity and constant space complexity. Experiments on 45 datasets demonstrate that SVEAD outperforms 12 state-of-the-art approaches.

*Ibai Ramirez,Jokin Alcibar,Joel Pino,Mikel Sanz,Jose I. Aizpurua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) to improve uncertainty quantification in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), outperforming deterministic and dropout-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in PHM lack robust uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in risk-aware decision-making for asset management.

Method: The proposed B-PINN integrates Bayesian Neural Networks with physics-based constraints and prior distributions to model both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, providing full predictive posteriors.

Result: B-PINN shows improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates compared to deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs, and other B-PINN variants.

Conclusion: Bayesian physics-informed learning enhances uncertainty-aware prognostics, supporting informed decision-making in transformer asset management.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a framework for integrating physical laws with data. However, their application to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) remains constrained by the limited uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities. Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of Bayesian physics-informed learning to support uncertainty-aware prognostics and informed decision-making in transformer asset management.

*Xin Lai,Shiming Deng,Lu Yu,Yumin Lai,Shenghao Qiao,Xinze Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RRE-PPO4Pred enhances RNNs for time series forecasting by introducing reinforced recurrent encoding and a prediction-oriented optimization algorithm, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RNN-based predictors treat all time steps equally, limiting performance. The paper aims to optimize RNNs by leveraging reinforcement learning for better forecasting accuracy.

Method: Proposes RRE-PPO4Pred, combining a Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) with a Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO4Pred) algorithm. The RRE formulates RNN adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, while PPO4Pred uses a Transformer-based agent for efficient sampling.

Result: Outperforms baselines across five real-world datasets, achieving better accuracy than state-of-the-art Transformer models.

Conclusion: RRE-PPO4Pred provides an advanced time series predictor by integrating reinforcement learning with RNNs, demonstrating superior performance in engineering informatics.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor, enhances data-driven reaction analysis by capturing intrinsic bond changes, improving clustering and visualization of reaction space diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective, general-purpose reaction descriptors to bridge real-world chemistry with digital representations drives this study.

Method: RXNEmb is derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones, learning bond formation and cleavage patterns.

Result: RXNEmb improves clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset and enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Attention weight analysis provides mechanistic insights.

Conclusion: RXNEmb is a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting, advancing data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.

Abstract: With the rise of data-driven reaction prediction models, effective reaction descriptors are crucial for bridging the gap between real-world chemistry and digital representations. However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores privacy risks in graph generative diffusion models through three black-box inference attacks—graph reconstruction, property inference, and membership inference—demonstrating their effectiveness and proposing defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover unexplored privacy risks in graph generative diffusion models, which generate complex graph structures but may leak sensitive information.

Method: Designs three attacks: graph reconstruction, property inference, and membership inference; evaluates them on three diffusion models and six real-world graphs; proposes defense mechanisms.

Result: Attacks outperform baselines, proving significant information leakage; defense mechanisms offer a better utility-defense trade-off than existing methods.

Conclusion: Graph generative diffusion models are vulnerable to privacy risks, but proposed defenses mitigate these issues effectively.

Abstract: Graph generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating complex graph structures, effectively capturing intricate dependencies and relationships within graph data. However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

### [224] [TreeAdv: Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03703)
*Lang Cao,Hui Ruan,Yongqian Li,Peng Chao,Wu Ning,Haonan Song,Renhong Chen,Yitong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeAdv improves reinforcement learning efficiency by using tree-structured advantage redistribution for group-based objectives, outperforming methods like GRPO and GSPO with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GRPO treats trajectories as flat sequences, leading to inefficiency and bias. TreeAdv addresses this by leveraging tree structures for exploration and advantage assignment.

Method: TreeAdv builds trees using entropy-driven sampling, branching at uncertain decisions and sharing certain tokens. It redistributes advantages for tree segments and integrates with group-based objectives.

Result: TreeAdv outperforms GRPO and GSPO on 10 math reasoning benchmarks while using fewer tokens under the same conditions.

Conclusion: TreeAdv's tree-structured approach enhances efficiency and performance in reinforcement learning for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with group-based objectives, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is a common framework for aligning large language models on complex reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.

### [225] [Investigating Knowledge Distillation Through Neural Networks for Protein Binding Affinity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03704)
*Wajid Arshad Abbasi,Syed Ali Abbas,Maryum Bibi,Saiqa Andleeb,Muhammad Naveed Akhtar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A knowledge distillation framework improves sequence-based protein binding affinity prediction by leveraging structural data during training, achieving performance closer to structure-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting protein-protein binding affinity is challenging due to limited structural data. Structure-based models outperform sequence-based ones, but structural data is often unavailable.

Method: Proposes a regression framework using knowledge distillation, where a sequence-based student network is trained under supervision from a structure-informed teacher network, using binding affinity labels and feature representations.

Result: The student model achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.481 and RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, outperforming sequence-only baselines (0.375 P_r, 2.712 kcal/mol RMSE) and nearing structure-based models (0.512 P_r, 2.445 kcal/mol RMSE).

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation effectively transfers structural knowledge to sequence-based models, reducing performance gaps and bias, with potential scalability as datasets grow.

Abstract: The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors.

*Gil Shabat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper clarifies the geometric intuition behind Pivoted Cholesky decomposition in kernel methods, linking it to Farthest Point Sampling and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization in RKHS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify the geometric aspects of Pivoted Cholesky decomposition within kernel methods, which are often overlooked despite its widespread use.

Method: The study connects Pivoted Cholesky decomposition to Farthest Point Sampling and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization in RKHS, supported by theoretical derivations and a Python implementation.

Result: The pivotal selection step in Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is shown to be equivalent to FPS, and the Cholesky factor construction resembles implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application of Pivoted Cholesky decomposition in kernel methods.

Abstract: Low-rank approximations of large kernel matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly for scaling Gaussian Processes to massive datasets. The Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is a standard tool for this task, offering a computationally efficient, greedy low-rank approximation. While its algebraic properties are well-documented in numerical linear algebra, its geometric intuition within the context of kernel methods often remains obscure. In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We demonstrate that the pivotal selection step is mathematically equivalent to Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the kernel metric, and that the Cholesky factor construction is an implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We provide a concise derivation and a minimalist Python implementation to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R³L introduces Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with language-guided exploration, pivotal credit, and positive amplification to address exploration and exploitation challenges in LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches struggle with exploration (low success rates, high costs) and exploitation (coarse credit assignment, training instability).

Method: R³L uses reflect-then-retry for active synthesis, language feedback for error diagnosis, pivotal credit assignment for localized updates, and positive amplification to prioritize successful trajectories.

Result: Experiments show 5% to 52% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining stability.

Conclusion: R³L effectively addresses RL challenges in LLM reasoning and agentic tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning drives recent advances in LLM reasoning and agentic capabilities, yet current approaches struggle with both exploration and exploitation. Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\% to 52\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability. Our code is released at https://github.com/shiweijiezero/R3L.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ETR introduces dynamic trust regions to address GRPO's static constraints, improving performance and mitigating entropy collapse in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's uniform trust region constraint misaligns with heterogeneous signal quality in outcome-driven learning, limiting efficiency and exploration.

Method: ETR uses dual-level elasticity: micro-level scaling of clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude and macro-level variance-based budget allocation.

Result: ETR outperforms GRPO on AIME and MATH benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy and sustained exploration.

Conclusion: ETR's dynamic approach effectively addresses GRPO's limitations, offering a more adaptable and efficient solution for RLVR.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an important paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, exemplified by the success of OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \textbf{E}lastic \textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egions (\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration.

TL;DR: EDCO is a dynamic curriculum learning framework for fine-tuning domain-specific LLMs, using inference entropy to adaptively prioritize training samples, improving efficiency and performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static curricula in LLM fine-tuning lack adaptability to model needs, prompting the need for a dynamic approach like EDCO to enhance learning efficiency and reasoning gains.

Method: EDCO integrates an efficient entropy estimator, entropy-based curriculum generator, and LLM trainer to adaptively prioritize high-entropy samples during fine-tuning.

Result: EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies in domains like communication, medicine, and law, achieving computational efficiency with an 83.5% reduction in time.

Conclusion: EDCO demonstrates the effectiveness of dynamic curriculum learning using inference entropy, offering a scalable solution for improving domain-specific LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Domain-specific large language models (LLMs), typically developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained general-purpose LLM on specialized datasets, represent a significant advancement in applied AI. A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEM-2 is a lightweight probabilistic transformer that directly learns atmospheric dynamics and user-relevant variables, outperforming traditional NWP models and competitive ML approaches with efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional weather forecasts require suboptimal post-processing for decision-relevant targets, leading to structural bias. GEM-2 aims to address this by learning these targets directly.

Method: GEM-2 is a probabilistic transformer trained on the CRPS objective, focusing on global atmospheric dynamics and actionable variables. It is lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup).

Result: GEM-2 outperforms operational NWP models, matches ML models with complex processes, achieves top economic value metrics, and shows stable convergence at S2S/seasonal scales.

Conclusion: GEM-2 demonstrates that direct learning of user-relevant variables is feasible and superior, with surprising robustness to design choices.

Abstract: Weather forecasts sit upstream of high-stakes decisions in domains such as grid operations, aviation, agriculture, and emergency response. Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.
  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.

*Noam Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates neural scaling laws using a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning with latent instance difficulty (LID), connecting generalization loss to inference performance via power-law decay in pass@k failure rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how intrinsic, instance-specific target variances influence generalization and inference performance in neural networks.

Method: The authors propose the LID model, where each input's target variance is governed by a heavy-tailed latent precision distribution. Theoretical analysis and simulations are used to derive predictions.

Result: Key findings include a power-law decay in pass@k failure rates, with exponents dependent on training sample size, and a computable allocation rule favoring training before inference saturation.

Conclusion: The LID model provides testable predictions validated in simulations and real-data proxies, revealing how learning reduces the hard tail of error distributions.

Abstract: We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-β_\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $β_\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $β$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.

*Sebastian Müller,Tobias Schneider,Ruben Kemna,Vanessa Toborek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFIRE, a surrogate rule model for tabular data, suffers from ambiguity. A pruning strategy is proposed to reduce ambiguity and model size without harming performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ambiguity in CFIRE's rule assignments to improve transparency in tabular data models.

Method: Proposing a post-hoc pruning strategy to eliminate low-contribution or conflicting rules.

Result: Smaller, less ambiguous models with preserved fidelity and minimal impact on predictive performance.

Conclusion: The pruning strategy enhances CFIRE's effectiveness for transparent model explanations.

Abstract: Models trained on tabular data are widely used in sensitive domains, increasing the demand for explanation methods to meet transparency needs. CFIRE is a recent algorithm in this domain that constructs compact surrogate rule models from local explanations. While effective, CFIRE may assign rules associated with different classes to the same sample, introducing ambiguity. We investigate this ambiguity and propose a post-hoc pruning strategy that removes rules with low contribution or conflicting coverage, yielding smaller and less ambiguous models while preserving fidelity. Experiments across multiple datasets confirm these improvements with minimal impact on predictive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs, where labeled data is absent, using a novel approach.

Method: Pre-trains a graph-language model, trains a conditional generative model for joint distribution, and uses synthetic samples for prompt tuning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in experiments on benchmark datasets, with ablation studies confirming the generator's importance.

Conclusion: ZPT framework effectively enables zero-shot node classification by leveraging synthetic data generation and prompt tuning.

Abstract: Node classification is a fundamental problem in information retrieval with many real-world applications, such as community detection in social networks, grouping articles published online and product categorization in e-commerce. Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator. The code is provided at: https://github.com/Sethup123/ZPT.

*Rehan Ahmad,Muhammad Kashif,Nouhaila Innan,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A benchmarking framework compares QML and classical models in financial tasks, showing QML outperforms classical methods when data and design align, but classical methods dominate otherwise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate and compare the performance of quantum machine learning (QML) models against classical counterparts in financial applications.

Method: Uses standardized data splits, features, and metrics to compare QML and classical models across three tasks: directional return prediction, live-trading simulation, and realized volatility forecasting.

Result: QML models show gains in specific scenarios: hybrid quantum neural networks outperform in directional classification, QLSTM excels in live trading, and QSVR achieves competitive results in volatility forecasting.

Conclusion: The framework identifies scenarios where QML models outperform classical methods, highlighting the importance of aligning data structure and circuit design for QML success.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a reproducible benchmarking framework that systematically compares QML models with architecture-matched classical counterparts across three financial tasks: (i) directional return prediction on U.S. and Turkish equities, (ii) live-trading simulation with Quantum LSTMs versus classical LSTMs on the S\&P 500, and (iii) realized volatility forecasting using Quantum Support Vector Regression. By standardizing data splits, features, and evaluation metrics, our study provides a fair assessment of when current-generation QML models can match or exceed classical methods. Our results reveal that quantum approaches show performance gains when data structure and circuit design are well aligned. In directional classification, hybrid quantum neural networks surpass the parameter-matched ANN by \textbf{+3.8 AUC} and \textbf{+3.4 accuracy points} on \texttt{AAPL} stock and by \textbf{+4.9 AUC} and \textbf{+3.6 accuracy points} on Turkish stock \texttt{KCHOL}. In live trading, the QLSTM achieves higher risk-adjusted returns in \textbf{two of four} S\&P~500 regimes. For volatility forecasting, an angle-encoded QSVR attains the \textbf{lowest QLIKE} on \texttt{KCHOL} and remains within $\sim$0.02-0.04 QLIKE of the best classical kernels on \texttt{S\&P~500} and \texttt{AAPL}. Our benchmarking framework clearly identifies the scenarios where current QML architectures offer tangible improvements and where established classical methods continue to dominate.

*Arpad Berta,Gabor Danner,Istvan Hegedus,Mark Jelasity*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses detecting semantic backdoors in classification models, proposing a method using a reference model pool and model distance thresholds, outperforming existing detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic backdoors are hard to detect due to lack of identifiable patterns; the work is motivated by consumer protection scenarios.

Method: Uses a reference model pool of clean and poisoned models, calibrates thresholds, and measures distances using inverted input samples.

Result: The method reliably separates clean and poisoned models, especially with adversarial training, outperforming state-of-the-art detectors.

Conclusion: The approach effectively detects semantic backdoors, proving superior to existing methods in consumer protection scenarios.

Abstract: Detecting semantic backdoors in classification models--where some classes can be activated by certain natural, but out-of-distribution inputs--is an important problem that has received relatively little attention. Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.

TL;DR: LTN-GAN enhances GANs by integrating Logic Tensor Networks to enforce domain-specific logical constraints during sample generation, improving diversity and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of GANs in incorporating prior knowledge or logical consistency, especially in domains requiring rule adherence.

Method: Combines GANs with Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to integrate first-order logic constraints into the generative process.

Result: Outperforms traditional GANs on synthetic and MNIST datasets, showing better adherence to logical constraints without sacrificing sample quality or diversity.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to improve generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Logic Tensor Network-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (LTN-GAN), a novel framework that enhances Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by incorporating Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to enforce domain-specific logical constraints during the sample generation process. Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples. This work highlights the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains.

*Shudong Liu,Hanwen Zhang,Xiuling Wang,Yuesheng Zhu,Guibo Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FALCON improves OSFL for non-IID image data using hierarchical token sequences and knowledge distillation, achieving better accuracy than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OSFL methods struggle with non-IID data and robustness in domains like medical imaging.

Method: FALCON uses hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation, involving pretrained encoders, transformers, and a server-client workflow.

Result: Experiments show FALCON outperforms baselines by 9.58% average accuracy in non-IID scenarios.

Conclusion: FALCON effectively addresses OSFL limitations for non-IID image data, enhancing robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: One-shot federated learning (OSFL) reduces the communication cost and privacy risks of iterative federated learning by constructing a global model with a single round of communication. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.

TL;DR: SR-MoE introduces spectral regularization to prevent expert collapse in Mixture of Experts architectures, maintaining modularity and improving adaptation stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address expert collapse in MoE architectures, where routing favors few experts, reducing model capacity and causing interference during adaptation.

Method: Proposes Spectrally-Regularized Mixture of Experts (SR-MoE) with dual regularization: spectral norm constraints and stable rank penalties to enforce structural modularity.

Result: SR-MoE outperforms traditional linear gating, maintaining structural integrity (mean interference -0.32%) despite increased depth or complexity.

Conclusion: SR-MoE is a scalable solution for high-capacity, modular networks, enabling stable lifelong learning through localized expert updates.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures enable efficient scaling of neural networks but suffer from expert collapse, where routing converges to a few dominant experts. This reduces model capacity and causes catastrophic interference during adaptation. We propose the Spectrally-Regularized Mixture of Experts (SR-MoE), which imposes geometric constraints on the routing manifold to enforce structural modularity. Our method uses dual regularization: spectral norm constraints bound routing function Lipschitz continuity, while stable rank penalties preserve high-dimensional feature diversity in expert selection. We evaluate SR-MoE across architectural scales and dataset complexities using modular one-shot adaptation tasks. Results show that traditional linear gating fails with increasing depth (accuracy drops up to 4.72% due to expert entanglement), while SR-MoE maintains structural integrity (mean interference -0.32%). Our spectral constraints facilitate positive knowledge transfer, enabling localized expert updates without global performance decay. SR-MoE provides a general solution for building high-capacity, modular networks capable of stable lifelong learning.

TL;DR: ABC-GRPO is an improved version of GRPO for reinforcement learning with LLMs, offering better flexibility, generalization, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The clipping mechanism in GRPO is suboptimal; adaptive modifications can enhance its effectiveness.

Method: Introduces Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement.

Result: ABC-GRPO outperforms GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks and maintains higher entropy.

Conclusion: ABC-GRPO improves GRPO's performance and exploration capacity, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios. With appropriate modifications, GRPO can be significantly enhanced to improve both flexibility and generalization. To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility https://github.com/chi2liu/ABC-GRPO.

### [240] [A Gap Between Decision Trees and Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03919)
*Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores conflicts between geometric simplicity (interpretability) and accuracy in approximating axis-aligned decision trees with shallow neural networks, focusing on Radon total variation (RTV) seminorm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand tradeoffs between interpretability (simple decision boundaries) and accuracy when shallow ReLU networks approximate decision trees.

Method: Analyzes infinite-width, bounded-norm, single-hidden-layer ReLU networks using RTV seminorm to measure geometric complexity of level sets. Examines surrogates like ramp smoothing and Gaussian convolution.

Result: Hard tree indicators and surrogates have infinite RTV in higher dimensions, except Gaussian convolution (finite RTV but exponential dependence on dimension). Constructs smooth barrier score for classification with finite RTV.

Conclusion: Separates classification and score learning goals, showing finite RTV solutions exist for accurate classification under mild conditions, highlighting tradeoffs.

Abstract: We study when geometric simplicity of decision boundaries, used here as a notion of interpretability, can conflict with accurate approximation of axis-aligned decision trees by shallow neural networks. Decision trees induce rule-based, axis-aligned decision regions (finite unions of boxes), whereas shallow ReLU networks are typically trained as score models whose predictions are obtained by thresholding. We analyze the infinite-width, bounded-norm, single-hidden-layer ReLU class through the Radon total variation ($\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm, which controls the geometric complexity of level sets.
  We first show that the hard tree indicator $1_A$ has infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$. Moreover, two natural split-wise continuous surrogates--piecewise-linear ramp smoothing and sigmoidal (logistic) smoothing--also have infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ in dimensions $d>1$, while Gaussian convolution yields finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ but with an explicit exponential dependence on $d$.
  We then separate two goals that are often conflated: classification after thresholding (recovering the decision set) versus score learning (learning a calibrated score close to $1_A$). For classification, we construct a smooth barrier score $S_A$ with finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ whose fixed threshold $τ=1$ exactly recovers the box. Under a mild tube-mass condition near $\partial A$, we prove an $L_1(P)$ calibration bound that decays polynomially in a sharpness parameter, along with an explicit $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ upper bound in terms of face measures. Experiments on synthetic unions of rectangles illustrate the resulting accuracy--complexity tradeoff and how threshold selection shifts where training lands along it.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOREVER introduces a model-centric approach to continual learning for LLMs, aligning memory replay schedules with optimizer update magnitudes for better alignment with learning progress, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misalignment in traditional step-based memory replay methods for continual learning in LLMs, which often don't reflect actual learning progress due to varying parameter changes per step.

Method: Proposes FOREVER, which uses optimizer update magnitudes ('model time') to schedule replays inspired by human forgetting curves, incorporating adaptive regularization.

Result: Demonstrates consistent mitigation of catastrophic forgetting across benchmarks and models (0.6B to 13B parameters).

Conclusion: FOREVER effectively aligns replay schedules with internal model evolution, improving continual learning performance.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study develops explainable ML models for stage-specific cancer survival prediction, revealing hidden feature-stage interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cancer survival models combine all disease stages, potentially overestimating performance and missing stage-specific insights.

Method: Used SEER dataset to create explainable ML models for colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers, employing SHAP and LIME for interpretability.

Result: Identified how demographic and clinical variables impact survival differently across stages and cancer types.

Conclusion: Stage-specific models enhance transparency and clinical relevance, aiding personalized treatment planning.

Abstract: Despite the fact that cancer survivability rates vary greatly between stages, traditional survival prediction models have frequently been trained and assessed using examples from all combined phases of the disease. This method may result in an overestimation of performance and ignore the stage-specific variations. Using the SEER dataset, we created and verified explainable machine learning (ML) models to predict stage-specific cancer survivability in colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers. ML-based cancer survival analysis has been a long-standing topic in the literature; however, studies involving the explainability and transparency of ML survivability models are limited. Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types. These insights provide not only transparency but also clinical relevance, supporting personalized treatment planning. By focusing on stage-specific models, this study provides new insights into the most important factors at each stage of cancer, offering transparency and potential clinical relevance to support personalized treatment planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparency in black-box news recommender systems to aid editorial decision-making.

Method: Uses fuzzy neural networks to extract human-readable rules from behavioral data, with adjustable thresholds for rule complexity.

Result: Accurately predicts clicks on MIND and EB-NeRD datasets, outperforming baselines while revealing news consumption patterns.

Conclusion: The system successfully combines accuracy and transparency, helping editors align content with audience behavior.

Abstract: News recommender systems are increasingly driven by black-box models, offering little transparency for editorial decision-making. In this work, we introduce a transparent recommender system that uses fuzzy neural networks to learn human-readable rules from behavioral data for predicting article clicks. By extracting the rules at configurable thresholds, we can control rule complexity and thus, the level of interpretability. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available news datasets (i.e., MIND and EB-NeRD) and show that we can accurately predict click behavior compared to several established baselines, while learning human-readable rules. Furthermore, we show that the learned rules reveal news consumption patterns, enabling editors to align content curation goals with target audience behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced symbolic regression approach with multiple categorical variables and intermediate parameter sharing, reducing parameter count and enhancing problem insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve symbolic regression by allowing more complex parameter sharing across multiple categorical variables, enhancing interpretability and reducing data requirements.

Method: Expands symbolic regression to include multiple categorical variables and introduces intermediate levels of parameter sharing (shared across one category but not the other). Tested with synthetic and real-world astrophysics datasets.

Result: Achieves similar fit quality with fewer parameters, reduces data requirements, and extracts additional problem insights. Demonstrated on an astrophysics dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances symbolic regression by optimizing parameter sharing and providing deeper understanding, as validated by synthetic and real-world examples.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to find symbolic expressions that describe datasets. Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only "non-shared" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate "shared" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable. We achieve a similar fit quality but require significantly fewer individual parameters, and extract additional information about the problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an autoregressive diffusion framework for designing mechanical linkages, using transformers and DDPM to sequentially generate graphs representing mechanisms, enabling scalable and adaptive inverse design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in designing mechanical linkages due to nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationships and combinatorial design space, making traditional methods computationally intractable.

Method: An autoregressive diffusion framework combines a causal transformer and DDPM to sequentially construct graphs (nodes as joints, edges as links) conditioned on target trajectories.

Result: The method successfully synthesizes linkage systems with up to 20 nodes, correcting degenerate configurations and surpassing traditional optimization approaches.

Conclusion: This work advances autoregressive graph generation and computational kinematic synthesis, offering scalable inverse design paradigms for complex mechanical systems.

Abstract: Designing mechanical linkages to achieve target end-effector trajectories presents a fundamental challenge due to the intricate coupling between continuous node placements, discrete topological configurations, and nonlinear kinematic constraints. The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts. We demonstrate successful synthesis of linkage systems containing up to 20 nodes with extensibility to N-node architectures. This work advances autoregressive graph generation methodologies and computational kinematic synthesis, establishing new paradigms for scalable inverse design of complex mechanical systems.

Result: Achieves 79.5% accuracy and Kappa of 0.65 for classifying sleep stages, showing significant improvement over traditional methods.

Conclusion: The approach enhances reliability of sleep staging models, especially where radar data is scarce, benefiting older adults and those with neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Objective: Ultra-wideband radar technology offers a promising solution for unobtrusive and cost-effective in-home sleep monitoring. However, the limited availability of radar sleep data poses challenges in building robust models that generalize across diverse cohorts and environments. This study proposes a novel deep transfer learning framework to enhance sleep stage classification using radar data. Methods: An end-to-end neural network was developed to classify sleep stages based on nocturnal respiratory and motion signals. The network was trained using a combination of large-scale polysomnography (PSG) datasets and radar data. A domain adaptation approach employing adversarial learning was utilized to bridge the knowledge gap between PSG and radar signals. Validation was performed on a radar dataset of 47 older adults (mean age: 71.2), including 18 participants with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Results: The proposed network structure achieves an accuracy of 79.5% with a Kappa value of 0.65 when classifying wakefulness, rapid eye movement, light sleep and deep sleep. Experimental results confirm that our deep transfer learning approach significantly enhances automatic sleep staging performance in the target domain. Conclusion: This method effectively addresses challenges associated with data variability and limited sample size, substantially improving the reliability of automatic sleep staging models, especially in contexts where radar data is limited. Significance: The findings underscore the viability of UWB radar as a nonintrusive, forward-looking sleep assessment tool that could significantly benefit care for older people and people with neurodegenerative disorders.

Motivation: To classify trajectory data generated by nonlinear dynamics, where each class corresponds to a distinct dynamical system.

Method: Proposes Dynafit, a kernel-based method that approximates the Koopman operator to learn a distance metric between trajectories in feature space.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in chaos detection, recognition of handwritten dynamics, and visual dynamic textures.

Conclusion: Dynafit is versatile for classifying nonlinear dynamical systems and can incorporate partial knowledge of dynamics.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying trajectory data generated by some nonlinear dynamics, where each class corresponds to a distinct dynamical system. We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics. New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning. We also show that the kernel function can be tailored to incorporate partial knowledge of the dynamics when available. Dynafit is applicable to various classification tasks involving nonlinear dynamical systems and sensors. We illustrate its effectiveness on three examples: chaos detection with the logistic map, recognition of handwritten dynamics and of visual dynamic textures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning under data scarcity often fails due to unreliable validation performance. Addressing this challenge requires preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity.

Method: Proposes CausalMixFT, which uses Structural Causal Models to generate synthetic samples that augment limited real data, maintaining structural consistency.

Result: Improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 to 0.12 across 33 datasets, outperforms statistical generators, and narrows validation-test correlation gap.

Conclusion: Incorporating causal structure into data augmentation effectively improves fine-tuning stability and performance in low-data regimes.

Abstract: Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.

TL;DR: Federated learning enables collaborative blood morphology analysis across institutions without sharing data, improving generalization while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated blood morphology analysis in LMICs is hindered by dataset shifts and privacy restrictions, necessitating a privacy-preserving solution.

Method: A federated learning framework trains models across multiple clinical sites without exchanging data, using diverse blood films.

Result: Federated models achieve robust cross-site performance and better generalization than centralized training, especially with convolutional and transformer architectures.

Conclusion: Federated learning is a viable, privacy-preserving method for scalable and equitable AI in medical imaging for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Automated blood morphology analysis can support hematological diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but remains sensitive to dataset shifts from staining variability, imaging differences, and rare morphologies. Building centralized datasets to capture this diversity is often infeasible due to privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions. We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training.

*Alberto Marfoglia,Jong Ho Jhee,Adrien Coulet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEDS-OWL integrates the Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) with the Semantic Web, enabling standardized, interoperable representation of healthcare data for machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare data lacks standardized representation, limiting interoperability and reproducibility for machine learning applications.

Method: Developed MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology, and meds2rdf, a Python tool, to convert MEDS datasets into RDF graphs. Validated using SHACL constraints.

Result: MEDS-OWL includes 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 axioms, enabling FAIR-aligned datasets and interoperability.

Conclusion: This work bridges MEDS with the Semantic Web, providing a reusable semantic layer for event-based clinical data and supporting graph-based analytics.

Abstract: The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments. The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data. By bridging MEDS with the Semantic Web, this work contributes a reusable semantic layer for event-based clinical data and establishes a robust foundation for subsequent graph-based analytics.

### [251] [Agentic Rubrics as Contextual Verifiers for SWE Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04171)
*Mohit Raghavendra,Anisha Gunjal,Bing Liu,Yunzhong He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agentic Rubrics offer a scalable, context-grounded verification method for software engineering agents, outperforming baselines by at least 3.5 percentage points without requiring test execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current verification methods for software engineering agents, like code execution, face scalability issues. Patch classifiers and heuristics are alternatives but lack codebase context and interpretability.

Method: Agentic Rubrics involve an expert agent creating a context-grounded rubric checklist for scoring candidate patches, eliminating the need for test execution.

Result: On SWE-Bench Verified, Agentic Rubrics scored 54.2% (Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B) and 40.6% (Qwen3-32B), outperforming baselines by at least +3.5 percentage points. Rubric scores align with ground-truth tests and flag additional issues.

Conclusion: Agentic Rubrics provide an efficient, scalable, and granular verification signal, leveraging agentic context gathering for codebase-specific criteria.

Abstract: Verification is critical for improving agents: it provides the reward signal for Reinforcement Learning and enables inference-time gains through Test-Time Scaling (TTS). Despite its importance, verification in software engineering (SWE) agent settings often relies on code execution, which can be difficult to scale due to environment setup overhead. Scalable alternatives such as patch classifiers and heuristic methods exist, but they are less grounded in codebase context and harder to interpret. To this end, we explore Agentic Rubrics: an expert agent interacts with the repository to create a context-grounded rubric checklist, and candidate patches are then scored against it without requiring test execution. On SWE-Bench Verified under parallel TTS evaluation, Agentic Rubrics achieve a score of 54.2% on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and 40.6% on Qwen3-32B, with at least a +3.5 percentage-point gain over the strongest baseline in our comparison set. We further analyze rubric behavior, showing that rubric scores are consistent with ground-truth tests while also flagging issues that tests do not capture. Our ablations show that agentic context gathering is essential for producing codebase-specific, unambiguous criteria. Together, these results suggest that Agentic Rubrics provide an efficient, scalable, and granular verification signal for SWE agents.

### [252] [Robust Physics Discovery from Highly Corrupted Data: A PINN Framework Applied to the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04176)
*Pietro de Oliveira Esteves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using PINNs accurately recovers NLSE parameters under high noise, outperforming traditional methods with sub-1% error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with noisy data in NLSE parameter recovery, motivating a robust deep learning approach.

Method: Combines PINNs with automatic differentiation to recover parameters from sparse, noisy data.

Result: Achieves <0.2% error for nonlinear coefficient beta, generalizes across regimes, and runs in ~80 minutes on modest GPUs.

Conclusion: PINNs effectively handle noise and sparse data, offering a practical alternative for NLSE inverse problems.

Abstract: We demonstrate a deep learning framework capable of recovering physical parameters from the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) under severe noise conditions. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data points corrupted by 20 percent additive Gaussian noise, a regime where traditional finite difference methods typically fail due to noise amplification in numerical derivatives. We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption. Our results indicate that physics-based regularization acts as an effective filter against high measurement uncertainty, positioning PINNs as a viable alternative to traditional optimization methods for inverse problems in spatiotemporal dynamics where experimental data is scarce and noisy. All code is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.

*Nia Touko,Matthew O A Ellis,Cristiano Capone,Alessio Burrello,Elisa Donati,Luca Manneschi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight framework using Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) tackles EMG signal drift with minimal overhead, improving inter-session accuracy for prosthetic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Signal drift in EMG due to electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes disrupts long-term decoding, limiting prosthetic usability. Existing solutions are impractical for wearables.

Method: Proposes TTA with TCN backbone, featuring causal adaptive batch normalization, GMM alignment with experience replay, and meta-learning for calibration.

Result: Significantly improves inter-session accuracy on NinaPro DB6, with experience replay enhancing stability and meta-learning performing well with limited data.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust, plug-and-play myoelectric control for prosthetics, addressing long-term signal drift challenges efficiently.

Abstract: Reliable long-term decoding of surface electromyography (EMG) is hindered by signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes. While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, "plug-and-play" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.

TL;DR: QZero is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that achieves AlphaGo-level performance in Go without search, using self-play and off-policy learning with modest resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the efficiency of model-free reinforcement learning in mastering complex games like Go, challenging the reliance on search-based methods like MCTS.

Method: QZero employs entropy-regularized Q-learning with a single Q-value network for policy evaluation and improvement, trained via self-play and off-policy replay.

Result: QZero matched AlphaGo's performance after 5 months of training with 7 GPUs, showcasing model-free RL's viability for Go.

Conclusion: Model-free RL can effectively solve complex games like Go, demonstrating feasibility and efficiency without search or human data.

Abstract: The game of Go has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence, demanding sophisticated strategic reasoning and long-term planning. Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and off-policy experience replay. Built upon entropy-regularized Q-learning, QZero utilizes a single Q-value network to unify policy evaluation and improvement. Starting tabula rasa without human data and trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved a performance level comparable to that of AlphaGo. This demonstrates, for the first time, the efficiency of using model-free reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, as well as the feasibility of off-policy reinforcement learning in solving large-scale and complex environments.

### [255] [Digital Red Queen: Adversarial Program Evolution in Core War with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03335)
*Akarsh Kumar,Ryan Bahlous-Boldi,Prafull Sharma,Phillip Isola,Sebastian Risi,Yujin Tang,David Ha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a self-play algorithm using LLMs to evolve adaptive programs in Core War, showing improved generality and convergent behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the static nature of LLM-evolution frameworks by incorporating adversarial dynamics inspired by biological evolution.

Method: DRQ employs an LLM to evolve programs ('warriors') in Core War, continually adapting them to defeat previous versions.

Result: Warriors became more general and behaviorally convergent, resembling natural evolutionary processes.

Conclusion: Dynamic Red Queen objectives offer benefits over static ones, suggesting broader applications in adversarial domains like cybersecurity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent workflow improves LLM prompt compliance by separating task description optimization from constraint refinement, boosting compliance scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce conceptually accurate but procedurally flawed outputs due to overlooked formal constraints.

Method: Proposes a multi-agentic workflow that decouples task description optimization from constraint refinement, using quantitative feedback.

Result: Revised prompts significantly increase compliance scores in models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

Conclusion: Separating task and constraint refinement enhances LLM output compliance effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introspective RL agents, inspired by biological pain, outperform baseline agents by inferring internal states and integrating 'pain-belief' into rewards, showing human-like behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance Theory of Mind in AI by exploring how agents model internal states, particularly self-awareness inspired by biological pain.

Method: Agents infer internal states using a hidden Markov model (HMM) for 'pain-belief,' integrated into rewards in gridworlds. Includes chronic vs. normal pain models.

Result: Introspective agents outperform baseline agents and exhibit complex human-like behaviors.

Conclusion: Self-awareness through introspective signals enhances AI learning and behavior replication.

Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework provides a viable approach for certifying embodied AI systems, with uncertainty quantification serving as a key measurement mechanism.

Abstract: We propose a maturity-based framework for certifying embodied AI systems through explicit measurement mechanisms. We argue that certifiable embodied AI requires structured assessment frameworks, quantitative scoring mechanisms, and methods for navigating multi-objective trade-offs inherent in trustworthiness evaluation. We demonstrate this approach using uncertainty quantification as an exemplar measurement mechanism and illustrate feasibility through an Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) detection case study.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CPGPrompt translates clinical guidelines into structured prompts for LLMs, improving guideline adherence and interpretability in AI-assisted patient care, with strong performance in binary referral decisions but varied results in multi-class pathway tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating clinical practice guidelines into AI systems is challenging due to limitations like poor interpretability and inconsistent adherence. CPGPrompt aims to bridge this gap by leveraging LLMs for dynamic guideline navigation.

Method: The system converts guidelines into structured decision trees and uses LLMs to evaluate patient cases. Synthetic vignettes across three domains were tested for binary referral and multi-class pathway tasks.

Result: High performance in binary specialty referrals (F1: 0.85-1.00) was achieved, while multi-class pathway tasks showed domain-specific variations (F1: 0.47-0.77), influenced by guideline structure and complexity.

Conclusion: CPGPrompt demonstrates feasibility in integrating guidelines into AI, with strengths in binary decisions but challenges in complex pathway tasks, highlighting the need for guideline-specific adaptations.

Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LFMs transform healthcare AI but struggle with personalized treatment due to paradoxes like generalizability and privacy-performance. N-of-1 trials complement LFMs by validating causality at an individual level. A hybrid framework leveraging both is proposed for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations, highlighting paradoxes like generalizability and privacy-performance that hinder personalization.

Method: The paper proposes a hybrid framework: LFMs generate intervention candidates, and N-of-1 trials validate causality for individuals.

Result: LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials; they are complementary. The hybrid framework navigates paradoxes by combining LFMs' predictive power with N-of-1 trials' causal validation.

Conclusion: Responsible AI integration in personalized medicine requires clarifying prediction-causation boundaries and leveraging both LFMs and N-of-1 trials.

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of continual skill acquisition in open-ended environments by developing a framework that evolves through experience.

Method: PSN uses REFLECT for fault localization, progressive optimization with maturity-aware gating, and canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation.

Result: Experiments show robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended tasks.

Conclusion: PSN effectively handles skill acquisition and refinement, demonstrating parallels to neural network training dynamics.

Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

*Kengo Nakamura,Masaaki Nishino,Norihito Yasuda*

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the uncertainty in model parameters (often learned from data) and the lack of known tractability for computing the variance of inference outcomes, which this paper addresses.

Method: The study derives a polynomial-time algorithm for computing WMC variance with structured d-DNNF inputs and proves hardness for other compilation formats like DNNFs and FBDDs. Empirical validation is done using Bayesian networks.

Result: Results include a tractable algorithm for structured d-DNNFs, hardness proofs for other formats, and empirical demonstration of variance computation in Bayesian networks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while variance computation is tractable for structured d-DNNFs, it remains intractable for other formats, highlighting its practicality for uncertainty quantification in probabilistic inference.

Abstract: One of the most important queries in knowledge compilation is weighted model counting (WMC), which has been applied to probabilistic inference on various models, such as Bayesian networks. In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STAR-S is a framework integrating self-taught safety reasoning to defend LLMs against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to determine effective safety reasoning against jailbreak attacks, necessitating a self-improving solution.

Method: STAR-S combines safety rule reasoning and reflection in a self-taught loop, using fine-tuning to enhance reasoning iteratively.

Result: Experiments show STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks and surpasses baseline methods.

Conclusion: STAR-S successfully integrates self-taught safety reasoning, improving defense against jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether performance improvements in LLMs using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) stem from genuine reasoning or just longer outputs.

Method: Proposes a neuro-symbolic framework for non-intrusive, process-centric evaluation, identifies behavioral prototypes, and examines inference modes, training strategies, and model scale.

Result: Extended token generation isn't necessary for deep reasoning; mixing long/short CoT data risks premature saturation, and distillation into smaller models fails to replicate logical efficacy.

Conclusion: Current CoT evaluation lacks depth, and training/data strategies need refinement to improve genuine reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

*Yuxuan Jiang,Francis Ferraro*

TL;DR: SCRIBE is a reinforcement learning framework that improves credit assignment in multi-step reasoning by grounding rewards in skill prototypes, reducing reward variance and enhancing tool-augmented agent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing noisy and inconsistent reward signals in LLM-based judges by introducing fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish planning from execution.

Method: SCRIBE intervenes at a mid-level abstraction, using a curated library of skill prototypes to transform open-ended LLM evaluation into constrained verification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Qwen3-4B model accuracy from 43.3% to 63.3% and increasing success rates in multi-turn tool interactions.

Conclusion: SCRIBE's co-evolution across abstraction levels and additive benefits to low-level optimizations offer a scalable pathway to more reliable tool-using agents.

Abstract: Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.
  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.
  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.

*Yi Fang,Wenjie Wang,Mingfeng Xue,Boyi Deng,Fengli Xu,Dayiheng Liu,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAE-Steering, a method to control reasoning strategies in LRMs using Sparse Autoencoders for better reliability and flexibility, outperforming existing methods by 15% and improving accuracy by 7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs autonomously select reasoning strategies, often leading to inefficiencies or errors. Controlling these strategies is crucial for reliability and flexibility.

Method: SAE-Steering leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle strategy-entangled hidden states into features, then identifies strategy-specific features through a two-stage pipeline (recall and ranking).

Result: SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15% in control effectiveness and improves reasoning accuracy by 7% by redirecting erroneous paths.

Conclusion: Controlling reasoning strategies via disentangled feature spaces enhances LRM performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of SAE-Steering in improving reliability and task accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.

TL;DR: PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent, outperforms text-only models by 103% by integrating domain-specific tools for verifiable evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct transfer of text-based reasoning to protein function understanding is ineffective, requiring biological priors and tools.

Method: PFUA unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and answer generation using domain-specific tools.

Result: PFUA improves performance by 103% over text-only models on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: Protein function prediction benefits from tool-augmented reasoning over purely internal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning in symbolic domains such as mathematics and programming. However, our study shows that directly transferring such text-based reasoning paradigms to protein function understanding is ineffective: reinforcement learning mainly amplifies superficial keyword patterns while failing to introduce new biological knowledge, resulting in limited generalization. We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.

Result: A formal framework specifies collaboration agreements for AI agents and humans, validated through a clinical trial matching case study.

Conclusion: The approach provides actionable guidance and formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLM) and subsequent Agentic AI technologies requires systematic architectural guidance for building sophisticated, production-grade systems. This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study. Our goal is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining the formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.

TL;DR: SafeRemind is a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into LRM thinking steps, improving safety by up to 45.5%p without harming reasoning utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs' explicit thinking steps risk amplifying unsafe behaviors, and existing defenses overlook this unique reasoning dynamic. Safe-reminding phrases in thinking steps are found crucial for safety.

Method: Proposes SafeRemind, which dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases using entropy triggers at decision-locking points, requiring no parameter updates.

Result: Evaluated on five LRMs and six benchmarks, SafeRemind improves safety by up to 45.5%p while maintaining reasoning utility.

Conclusion: SafeRemind effectively enhances LRM safety by leveraging safe-reminding phrases during decoding, addressing a critical vulnerability in reasoning steps.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.

*Chen Zhang,Kepu Zhang,Jiatong Zhang,Xiao Zhang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SandwichR is a novel method combining initial answers with post-hoc reasoning to achieve low-latency query correction without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the latency-accuracy trade-off in query correction by aligning fast initial answers with reasoning insights.

Method: SandwichR uses an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm and consistency-aware RL to align initial and final corrections.

Result: SandwichR matches CoT's accuracy with a 40-70% latency reduction.

Conclusion: SandwichR effectively balances latency and accuracy, advancing real-time query correction.

Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

*Yonatan Vernik,Alexander Tuisov,David Izhaki,Hana Weitman,Gal A. Kaminka,Alexander Shleyfman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Automated planners using domain-independent heuristics struggle with scaling medication planning beyond seven drugs. This paper introduces domain-specific heuristics generated by an LLM to significantly improve scalability and planning efficiency for up to 28 medications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated planners for personalized medication planning are limited by scalability, handling only up to seven medications, which is impractical for clinical use.

Method: The authors propose programmatically specifying the domain and using an LLM to generate problem-specific heuristics for a fixed search algorithm (GBFS).

Result: The approach achieves dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling to at least 28 medications.

Conclusion: The method advances personalized medication planning toward practical clinical applications by enhancing scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

TL;DR: EntroCoT is a framework to improve Chain-of-Thought prompting by identifying and refining low-quality reasoning traces using entropy-based segmentation and Monte Carlo rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning datasets often contain 'answer right but reasoning wrong' issues, leading to unreliable intermediate steps.

Method: EntroCoT segments reasoning traces at uncertain points using entropy and evaluates step contributions via Monte Carlo rollouts.

Result: Fine-tuning on EntroCoT-refined datasets outperforms full-dataset supervision on mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: EntroCoT effectively enhances reasoning quality by filtering deceptive steps, improving model performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROI-Reasoning, a framework for optimizing computation allocation in LLMs under strict token budgets by predicting task difficulty and utility, improving performance and reducing regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' inability to inherently determine computation needs for tasks, the study aims to optimize reasoning performance under strict token constraints.

Method: Proposes ROI-Reasoning: Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning predicts cost and utility; Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes decision-making under token budgets.

Result: ROI-Reasoning improves scores and reduces regret in budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances LLMs' strategic computation allocation, proving effective under tight budgets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The KLM framework is foundational for defeasible entailment, but existing methods lack declarative solutions. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose an ASP-based approach to construct minimal ranked models and check entailment queries automatically.

Result: The method is proven correct and outperforms imperative implementations like InfOCF solver in efficiency.

Conclusion: The ASP-based approach successfully adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and enhances computational performance.

Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support legal experts by automating reasoning about criminal cases and clarifying judicial decisions using ASP.

Method: Analyze and encode ICC articles in ASP, validate on past verdicts, handle contradictions, generate decisions for new cases, and generalize rules inductively.

Result: A tool that offers reasoning, decision-making support, and explainability for legal outcomes, validated on previous cases.

Conclusion: The ASP-based tool enhances interpretability and support in criminal trials, with potential for broader legal applications.

Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision tree models' complexity hinders interpretability, especially in safety-critical contexts, necessitating formal justifications for model decisions.

Method: Uses Answer Set Programming (ASP) to generate explanations, offering flexibility and enumeration of all possible explanations compared to SAT-based methods.

Result: Empirical evaluation on diverse datasets shows the method's effectiveness and limitations relative to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The ASP-based method provides a flexible and comprehensive solution for explaining decision tree models, though it has some limitations.

Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.  We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes xDNN(ASP), a system generating global explanations for deep neural networks using logic programs under answer set semantics, maintaining accuracy while offering insights into feature importance and hidden nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of deep neural networks' 'black-box' nature has spurred the need for explainable AI, particularly methods that provide global explanations and consider network structure, which existing techniques often neglect.

Method: xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics from a neural network and its training data, aiming for a one-to-one correspondence between answer sets and input-output pairs.

Result: Experiments on synthetic datasets show the extracted logic program maintains prediction accuracy and provides insights into feature importance and hidden node impact, aiding network optimization.

Conclusion: xDNN(ASP) successfully bridges the gap between deep neural networks and explainability by offering global explanations and structural insights, paving the way for model optimization.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess whether current ASP solving techniques can handle large-scale configuration problems, such as electronic system configuration, which involves thousands of components.

Method: The researchers investigated the grounding bottleneck in ASP, focusing on incremental solving and developed a new method called constraint-aware guessing to reduce memory demands.

Result: The incremental solving approach was effective, but memory demands remained a significant limitation. Constraint-aware guessing significantly reduced the memory required for grounding.

Conclusion: While current ASP techniques show promise for large configuration problems, memory constraints remain a challenge. The constraint-aware guessing method offers a viable solution to mitigate memory demands.

Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.

TL;DR: Current agents struggle to effectively use generative world models for simulation, often misusing or avoiding them, leading to inconsistent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate whether agents can enhance their cognition by leveraging generative world models as external simulators for anticipating future states.

Method: Empirical examination across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, analyzing invocation frequency, misuse rates, and performance impacts of simulation.

Result: Agents rarely use simulation (<1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (~15%), and sometimes show degraded performance (up to 5%) with simulation. The bottleneck lies in decision-making around simulation.

Conclusion: Mechanisms are needed to improve strategic interaction with world models for reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.

Abstract: Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.

TL;DR: Trade-R1 introduces a framework combining RL with verification methods to improve decision-making in noisy financial markets, outperforming standard RL by reducing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL struggles in financial markets due to noisy rewards, leading to reward hacking. Trade-R1 aims to bridge this gap with verifiable reasoning.

Method: Uses structured RAG for reasoning verification and introduces triangular consistency metrics. Implements FSR and DSR reward integration strategies.

Result: Trade-R1 reduces reward hacking and improves generalization, with DSR outperforming in cross-market consistency.

Conclusion: Trade-R1 effectively adapts RL to stochastic financial environments, demonstrating robustness and superior reasoning consistency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses excessive verbosity in large reasoning models by introducing Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), reducing unnecessary tokens while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods penalize length but cause optimization conflicts and fail to address why models overthink. The paper identifies 'length shift' as a key issue.

Method: Introduces DOT to truncate redundant tokens selectively, aided by KL regularization and dynamic sampling for stable training.

Result: Reduces token usage by 78% on AIME-24 while improving accuracy, outperforming other efficient methods.

Conclusion: DOT effectively balances efficiency and performance by targeting overthinking without harming complex reasoning.

Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

TL;DR: MobileDreamer is an efficient world-model-based framework for GUI agents, improving long-horizon task performance through textual sketch world modeling and rollout imagination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents are reactive, limiting performance on long-horizon tasks. A world model for forecasting action outcomes could enhance decision-making.

Method: MobileDreamer uses a textual sketch world model to predict post-action states with spatial awareness and a rollout imagination strategy for action selection.

Result: Experiments on Android World show a 5.25% improvement in task success, and the textual sketch model accurately forecasts GUI elements.

Conclusion: MobileDreamer advances GUI agent performance by integrating efficient world modeling and future imagination, proving effective in real-world automation.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

Motivation: AI-generated content workflows on platforms like ComfyUI face challenges in maintaining structural consistency and achieving high pass rates due to complex components.

Method: ComfySearch explores the component space and constructs workflows through validation-guided methods.

Result: The framework achieves higher executability, solution rates, and generalization compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: ComfySearch effectively addresses the limitations of current ComfyUI workflow construction, enhancing performance and quality.

Abstract: AI-generated content has progressed from monolithic models to modular workflows, especially on platforms like ComfyUI, allowing users to customize complex creative pipelines. However, the large number of components in ComfyUI and the difficulty of maintaining long-horizon structural consistency under strict graph constraints frequently lead to low pass rates and workflows of limited quality. To tackle these limitations, we present ComfySearch, an agentic framework that can effectively explore the component space and generate functional ComfyUI pipelines via validation-guided workflow construction. Experiments demonstrate that ComfySearch substantially outperforms existing methods on complex and creative tasks, achieving higher executability (pass) rates, higher solution rates, and stronger generalization.

Motivation: To address the lack of research on long-term behavioral stability in multi-agent LLM systems, particularly the degradation of agent behavior and decision quality over time.

Method: Introduces the Agent Stability Index (ASI) to quantify drift across twelve dimensions, uses simulation-based analysis, and proposes three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation,

Result: Simulation-based analysis shows unchecked drift reduces task accuracy and increases human intervention. Proposed mitigation strategies like episodic memory consolidation show promise in reducing drift.,

Conclusion: The research provides tools to monitor and mitigate agent drift, enhancing reliability and safety in multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).
  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.
  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.
