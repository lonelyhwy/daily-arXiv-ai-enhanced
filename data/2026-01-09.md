### [1] [Beyond Binary Preference: Aligning Diffusion Models to Fine-grained Criteria by Decoupling Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04300)
*Chenye Meng,Zejian Li,Zhongni Liu,Yize Li,Changle Xie,Kaixin Jia,Ling Yang,Huanghuang Deng,Shiying Ding,Shengyuan Zhang,Jiayi Li,Lingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical and fine-grained alignment method called Complex Preference Optimization (CPO) for diffusion models, improving generation quality by incorporating detailed human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods for diffusion models are limited to simplified signals like scalar rewards or binary preferences, failing to capture the complexity and hierarchy of human expertise.

Method: The authors construct a hierarchical evaluation criteria with domain experts, then propose a two-stage alignment framework: injecting domain knowledge via Supervised Fine-Tuning and aligning the model using CPO, which extends DPO to handle non-binary, hierarchical criteria.

Result: Experiments in painting generation show CPO significantly enhances image quality and alignment with expert criteria.

Conclusion: CPO opens new avenues for fine-grained alignment of diffusion models, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of diffusion models relies on simplified signals, such as scalar rewards or binary preferences. This limits alignment with complex human expertise, which is hierarchical and fine-grained. To address this, we first construct a hierarchical, fine-grained evaluation criteria with domain experts, which decomposes image quality into multiple positive and negative attributes organized in a tree structure. Building on this, we propose a two-stage alignment framework. First, we inject domain knowledge to an auxiliary diffusion model via Supervised Fine-Tuning. Second, we introduce Complex Preference Optimization (CPO) that extends DPO to align the target diffusion to our non-binary, hierarchical criteria. Specifically, we reformulate the alignment problem to simultaneously maximize the probability of positive attributes while minimizing the probability of negative attributes with the auxiliary diffusion. We instantiate our approach in the domain of painting generation and conduct CPO training with an annotated dataset of painting with fine-grained attributes based on our criteria. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPO significantly enhances generation quality and alignment with expertise, opening new avenues for fine-grained criteria alignment.

### [2] [Embedding Textual Information in Images Using Quinary Pixel Combinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04302)
*A V Uday Kiran Kandala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method embeds text into images using quinary RGB pixel intensity combinations, outperforming traditional techniques like LSB and deep learning in efficiency and minimizing distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-in-image embedding methods (e.g., LSB, deep learning) are computationally heavy or distort images. The paper proposes a simpler, more efficient technique using quinary RGB combinations.

Method: The technique uses 125 unique RGB pixel intensity combinations (5 variations per channel) to map and embed textual symbols, achieving single-pixel encoding without distortion.

Result: Tests (MSE, PSNR, SSIM, etc.) showed no significant image distortion. The method encodes text in one pixel, outperforming LSB/MSB and deep learning in efficiency.

Conclusion: The quinary RGB method efficiently embeds text in images with minimal distortion, offering a lightweight alternative to traditional and learning-based approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique for embedding textual data into images using quinary combinations of pixel intensities in RGB space. Existing methods predominantly rely on least and most significant bit (LSB & MSB) manipulation, Pixel Value Differencing (PVD), spatial perturbations in RGB channels, transform domain based methods, Quantization methods, Edge and Region based methods and more recently through deep learning methods and generative AI techniques for hiding textual information in spatial domain of images. Most of them are dependent on pixel intensity flipping over multiple pixels, such as LSB and combination of LSB based methodologies, and on transform coefficients, often resulting in the form of noise. Encoding and Decoding are deterministic in most of the existing approaches and are computationally heavy in case of higher models such as deep learning and gen AI approaches. The proposed method works on quinary pixel intensity combinations in RGB space, where five controlled different pixel intensity variations in each of the R, G, and B channels formulate up to one hundred and twenty five distinct pixel intensity combinations. These combinations are mapped to textual symbols, enabling the representation of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters, numeric digits, whitespace, and commonly used special characters. Different metrics such as MSE, MAE, SNR, PSNR, SSIM, Histogram Comparison and Heatmap analysis, were evaluated for both original and encoded images resulting in no significant distortion in the images. Furthermore, the method achieves improved embedding efficiency by encoding a complete textual symbol within a single RGB pixel, in contrast to LSB and MSB based approaches that typically require multiple pixels or multi-step processes, as well as transform and learning based methods that incur higher computational overhead.

*Jiahui Chen,Philippe Hansen-Estruch,Xiaochuang Han,Yushi Hu,Emily Dinan,Amita Kamath,Michal Drozdzal,Reyhane Askari-Hemmat,Luke Zettlemoyer,Marjan Ghazvininejad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified text-image generation model that autonomously transitions between modalities, improving performance through reward-weighted post-training with targeted synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image (T2I) systems rely on sequential modality switching, limiting cross-modal coupling. This work aims to unify text and image generation into a single inference process for better performance.

Method: The approach uses post-training with reward-weighted synthetic data to unify text-image generation, examining modality coupling and testing different data strategies.

Result: The model improves multimodal image generation across four T2I benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of reward-weighting and strategic post-training data.

Conclusion: Fully unified text-image generation, enabled by targeted post-training, outperforms traditional sequential methods, highlighting the importance of cross-modal coupling.

Abstract: Unified multimodal generation architectures that jointly produce text and images have recently emerged as a promising direction for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, many existing systems rely on explicit modality switching, generating reasoning text before switching manually to image generation. This separate, sequential inference process limits cross-modal coupling and prohibits automatic multimodal generation. This work explores post-training to achieve fully unified text-image generation, where models autonomously transition from textual reasoning to visual synthesis within a single inference process. We examine the impact of joint text-image generation on T2I performance and the relative importance of each modality during post-training. We additionally explore different post-training data strategies, showing that a targeted dataset addressing specific limitations achieves superior results compared to broad image-caption corpora or benchmark-aligned data. Using offline, reward-weighted post-training with fully self-generated synthetic data, our approach enables improvements in multimodal image generation across four diverse T2I benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reward-weighting both modalities and strategically designed post-training data.

### [4] [ReHyAt: Recurrent Hybrid Attention for Video Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04342)
*Mohsen Ghafoorian,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReHyAt introduces a Recurrent Hybrid Attention mechanism combining softmax and linear attention, reducing training costs and maintaining video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scalability limitations of quadratic attention complexity in transformer-based video diffusion models.

Method: Recurrent Hybrid Attention (ReHyAt) mechanism enabling chunk-wise recurrent reformulation and constant memory usage.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art video quality with linear attention cost, reducing training by ~160 GPU hours.

Conclusion: ReHyAt provides efficient scalability for long-duration and on-device video generation, applicable to future models.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have shifted towards transformer-based architectures, achieving state-of-the-art video generation but at the cost of quadratic attention complexity, which severely limits scalability for longer sequences. We introduce ReHyAt, a Recurrent Hybrid Attention mechanism that combines the fidelity of softmax attention with the efficiency of linear attention, enabling chunk-wise recurrent reformulation and constant memory usage. Unlike the concurrent linear-only SANA Video, ReHyAt's hybrid design allows efficient distillation from existing softmax-based models, reducing the training cost by two orders of magnitude to ~160 GPU hours, while being competitive in the quality. Our light-weight distillation and finetuning pipeline provides a recipe that can be applied to future state-of-the-art bidirectional softmax-based models. Experiments on VBench and VBench-2.0, as well as a human preference study, demonstrate that ReHyAt achieves state-of-the-art video quality while reducing attention cost from quadratic to linear, unlocking practical scalability for long-duration and on-device video generation.

### [5] [SCAR-GS: Spatial Context Attention for Residuals in Progressive Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04348)
*Diego Revilla,Pooja Suresh,Anand Bhojan,Ooi Wei Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new compression method for 3D Gaussian Splatting using Residual Vector Quantization and an auto-regressive entropy model to improve efficiency and reduce storage needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D Gaussian Splatting compression rely on scalar quantization, which may not fully exploit high-dimensional feature correlations, limiting performance.

Method: The paper proposes a Residual Vector Quantization approach with an auto-regressive entropy model guided by a multi-resolution hash grid to compress primitive features efficiently.

Result: The new method achieves high efficiency in compressing coarse and refinement layers by accurately predicting conditional probabilities of transmitted indices.

Conclusion: The introduced progressive codec significantly improves compression for 3D Gaussian Splatting, enhancing deployment feasibility for cloud and streaming services.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting have allowed for real-time, high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Nonetheless, these models have significant storage requirements for large and medium-sized scenes, hindering their deployment over cloud and streaming services. Some of the most recent progressive compression techniques for these models rely on progressive masking and scalar quantization techniques to reduce the bitrate of Gaussian attributes using spatial context models. While effective, scalar quantization may not optimally capture the correlations of high-dimensional feature vectors, which can potentially limit the rate-distortion performance.
  In this work, we introduce a novel progressive codec for 3D Gaussian Splatting that replaces traditional methods with a more powerful Residual Vector Quantization approach to compress the primitive features. Our key contribution is an auto-regressive entropy model, guided by a multi-resolution hash grid, that accurately predicts the conditional probability of each successive transmitted index, allowing for coarse and refinement layers to be compressed with high efficiency.

*Ibrahim Tanvir,Alif Ruslan,Sartaj Solaiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Custom CNNs vs. pre-trained models (ResNet-18, VGG-16) were compared for image classification in Bangladesh datasets. Transfer learning with fine-tuning outperformed custom CNNs and feature extraction, achieving up to 76% better accuracy. ResNet-18 hit 100% accuracy on Road Damage BD. Custom CNNs are smaller and faster but pre-trained models excel in complex tasks with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether custom-built CNNs or pre-trained architectures (like ResNet-18 and VGG-16) are more effective for image classification tasks, especially in diverse datasets from Bangladesh.

Method: Comparative analysis using feature extraction and transfer learning approaches on five datasets: Footpath Vision, Auto Rickshaw Detection, Mango Image Classification, Paddy Variety Recognition, and Road Damage Detection.

Result: Transfer learning with fine-tuning consistently outperforms custom CNNs and feature extraction, with accuracy improvements from 3% to 76%. ResNet-18 achieved 100% accuracy on Road Damage BD. Custom CNNs are smaller (3.4M parameters) but pre-trained models perform better on complex tasks.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models with transfer learning are superior for complex tasks with limited data, while custom CNNs are efficient for simpler tasks. The study aids practitioners in choosing models based on dataset needs, resources, and performance goals.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of custom-built Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) against popular pre-trained architectures (ResNet-18 and VGG-16) using both feature extraction and transfer learning approaches. We evaluated these models across five diverse image classification datasets from Bangladesh: Footpath Vision, Auto Rickshaw Detection, Mango Image Classification, Paddy Variety Recognition, and Road Damage Detection. Our experimental results demonstrate that transfer learning with fine-tuning consistently outperforms both custom CNNs built from scratch and feature extraction methods, achieving accuracy improvements ranging from 3% to 76% across different datasets. Notably, ResNet-18 with fine-tuning achieved perfect 100% accuracy on the Road Damage BD dataset. While custom CNNs offer advantages in model size (3.4M parameters vs. 11-134M for pre-trained models) and training efficiency on simpler tasks, pre-trained models with transfer learning provide superior performance, particularly on complex classification tasks with limited training data. This research provides practical insights for practitioners in selecting appropriate deep learning approaches based on dataset characteristics, computational resources, and performance requirements.

### [7] [PackCache: A Training-Free Acceleration Method for Unified Autoregressive Video Generation via Compact KV-Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04359)
*Kunyang Li,Mubarak Shah,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PackCache, a KV-cache management method, accelerates unified autoregressive video generation by dynamically compacting the KV cache based on spatiotemporal properties, achieving significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency in unified autoregressive models due to the linear growth of KV-cache size with generated tokens, which limits inference efficiency and generative length.

Method: PackCache introduces three mechanisms: condition anchoring, cross-frame decay modeling, and spatially preserving position embedding to dynamically compact the KV cache.

Result: PackCache achieves 1.7-2.2x acceleration for 48-frame sequences and up to 3.7x acceleration for the final frames.

Conclusion: PackCache effectively mitigates KV-cache bottlenecks, enabling longer-sequence video generation with notable efficiency improvements.

Abstract: A unified autoregressive model is a Transformer-based framework that addresses diverse multimodal tasks (e.g., text, image, video) as a single sequence modeling problem under a shared token space. Such models rely on the KV-cache mechanism to reduce attention computation from O(T^2) to O(T); however, KV-cache size grows linearly with the number of generated tokens, and it rapidly becomes the dominant bottleneck limiting inference efficiency and generative length. Unified autoregressive video generation inherits this limitation. Our analysis reveals that KV-cache tokens exhibit distinct spatiotemporal properties: (i) text and conditioning-image tokens act as persistent semantic anchors that consistently receive high attention, and (ii) attention to previous frames naturally decays with temporal distance. Leveraging these observations, we introduce PackCache, a training-free KV-cache management method that dynamically compacts the KV cache through three coordinated mechanisms: condition anchoring that preserves semantic references, cross-frame decay modeling that allocates cache budget according to temporal distance, and spatially preserving position embedding that maintains coherent 3D structure under cache removal. In terms of efficiency, PackCache accelerates end-to-end generation by 1.7-2.2x on 48-frame long sequences, showcasing its strong potential for enabling longer-sequence video generation. Notably, the final four frames - the portion most impacted by the progressively expanding KV-cache and thus the most expensive segment of the clip - PackCache delivers a 2.6x and 3.7x acceleration on A40 and H200, respectively, for 48-frame videos.

### [8] [Combining facial videos and biosignals for stress estimation during driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04376)
*Paraskevi Valergaki,Vassilis C. Nicodemou,Iason Oikonomidis,Antonis Argyros,Anastasios Roussos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores stress recognition from facial videos using disentangled 3D facial geometry and cross-modal fusion with physiological signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stress recognition methods rely heavily on Facial Action Units, neglecting potential insights from 3D facial geometry.

Method: The authors analyze stress during distracted driving using EMOCA-derived 3D expression and pose coefficients, propose a Transformer-based temporal modeling framework, and test various fusion strategies.

Result: Cross-modal attention fusion of EMOCA and physiological signals achieved the best performance (AUROC 92%, Accuracy 86.7%).

Conclusion: Temporal modeling and cross-modal attention are effective for stress recognition, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Reliable stress recognition from facial videos is challenging due to stress's subjective nature and voluntary facial control. While most methods rely on Facial Action Units, the role of disentangled 3D facial geometry remains underexplored. We address this by analyzing stress during distracted driving using EMOCA-derived 3D expression and pose coefficients. Paired hypothesis tests between baseline and stressor phases reveal that 41 of 56 coefficients show consistent, phase-specific stress responses comparable to physiological markers. Building on this, we propose a Transformer-based temporal modeling framework and assess unimodal, early-fusion, and cross-modal attention strategies. Cross-Modal Attention fusion of EMOCA and physiological signals achieves best performance (AUROC 92\%, Accuracy 86.7\%), with EMOCA-gaze fusion also competitive (AUROC 91.8\%). This highlights the effectiveness of temporal modeling and cross-modal attention for stress recognition.

### [9] [Few-Shot LoRA Adaptation of a Flow-Matching Foundation Model for Cross-Spectral Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04381)
*Maxim Clouser,Kia Khezeli,John Kalantari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A flow-matching foundation model pre-trained on RGB images is adapted with LoRA modules to translate RGB images into IR and SAR modalities using minimal paired examples, improving downstream detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical applications often rely on non-visible modalities like IR and SAR, but foundation models are typically RGB-trained. The study explores adapting RGB models for cross-spectral tasks.

Method: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules are used to fine-tune the FLUX.1 Kontext model on 100 paired images per domain (RGB to IR/SAR). LPIPS on held-out pairs serves as a proxy for downstream detection performance.

Result: Synthetic IR/SAR data enhances downstream detection (YOLOv11n, DETR) when combined with limited real data. LPIPS correlates strongly with detection mAP.

Conclusion: Few-shot LoRA adaptation is effective for cross-spectral translation, enabling foundation-style support for non-visible modalities.

Abstract: Foundation models for vision are predominantly trained on RGB data, while many safety-critical applications rely on non-visible modalities such as infrared (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). We study whether a single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained primarily on RGB images can be repurposed as a cross-spectral translator using only a few co-measured examples, and whether the resulting synthetic data can enhance downstream detection. Starting from FLUX.1 Kontext, we insert low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules and fine-tune them on just 100 paired images per domain for two settings: RGB to IR on the KAIST dataset and RGB to SAR on the M4-SAR dataset. The adapted model translates RGB images into pixel-aligned IR/SAR, enabling us to reuse existing bounding boxes and train object detection models purely in the target modality. Across a grid of LoRA hyperparameters, we find that LPIPS computed on only 50 held-out pairs is a strong proxy for downstream performance: lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on both IR and SAR, and for DETR on KAIST IR test data. Using the best LPIPS-selected LoRA adapter, synthetic IR from external RGB datasets (LLVIP, FLIR ADAS) improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR significantly boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR. Our results suggest that few-shot LoRA adaptation of flow-matching foundation models is a promising path toward foundation-style support for non-visible modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of custom CNN vs. pre-trained models (VGG-16, ResNet-50, MobileNet) shows pre-trained models outperform in accuracy/speed, while custom CNN is simpler and computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to compare custom CNNs with pre-trained architectures to guide practical CNN selection for image classification tasks.

Method: A custom CNN is trained from scratch and compared with transfer learning-based pre-trained models (VGG-16, ResNet-50, MobileNet) using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Result: Pre-trained models outperform custom CNN in accuracy and convergence speed, especially with limited training data, but custom CNN shows competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower complexity.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between performance, complexity, and efficiency, aiding informed CNN architecture selection.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in image classification tasks; however, the choice between designing a custom CNN from scratch and employing established pre-trained architectures remains an important practical consideration. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of a custom-designed CNN and several widely used deep learning architectures, including VGG-16, ResNet-50, and MobileNet, for an image classification task. The custom CNN is developed and trained from scratch, while the popular architectures are employed using transfer learning under identical experimental settings. All models are evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results show that pre-trained CNN architectures consistently outperform the custom CNN in terms of classification accuracy and convergence speed, particularly when training data is limited. However, the custom CNN demonstrates competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity. This study highlights the trade-offs between model complexity, performance, and computational efficiency, and provides practical insights into selecting appropriate CNN architectures for image classification problems.

*Yike Zhang,Eduardo Davalos,Dingjie Su,Ange Lou,Jack Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning framework predicts mastoidectomy shapes from preoperative CT scans without human annotations, achieving a mean Dice score of 0.72 and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction improves cochlear implant surgery outcomes, but limited deep-learning studies exist due to challenges in acquiring ground-truth labels.

Method: Proposes a hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning model using preoperative CT scans to predict mastoidectomy regions without human annotations.

Result: Achieves a mean Dice score of 0.72, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating strong performance for boundary-less shape prediction.

Conclusion: This work is the first to integrate self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning for mastoidectomy prediction, offering a robust solution for surgical planning.

Abstract: Cochlear Implant (CI) surgery treats severe hearing loss by inserting an electrode array into the cochlea to stimulate the auditory nerve. An important step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, which removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone to provide surgical access. Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction from preoperative imaging improves pre-surgical planning, reduces risks, and enhances surgical outcomes. Despite its importance, there are limited deep-learning-based studies regarding this topic due to the challenges of acquiring ground-truth labels. We address this gap by investigating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning models to predict the mastoidectomy region without human annotations. We propose a hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning framework to predict the mastoidectomy region directly from preoperative CT scans, where the mastoid remains intact. Our hybrid method achieves a mean Dice score of 0.72 when predicting the complex and boundary-less mastoidectomy shape, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrating strong performance. The method provides groundwork for constructing 3D postmastoidectomy surfaces directly from the corresponding preoperative CT scans. To our knowledge, this is the first work that integrating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning for mastoidectomy shape prediction, offering a robust and efficient solution for CI surgical planning while leveraging 3D T-distribution loss in weakly-supervised medical imaging.

*Donghang Lyu,Marius Staring,Hildo Lamb,Mariya Doneva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRUNet-MR-Univ is proposed as a foundation model for Cardiac MRI reconstruction, addressing generalizability challenges posed by diverse CMR scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning excels in CMR reconstruction but lacks generalizability due to variability in scans.

Method: CRUNet-MR-Univ uses spatio-temporal correlations and prompt-based priors.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods across diverse settings.

Conclusion: The model shows promise for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has attracted increasing at- tention in the field of Cardiac MRI (CMR) reconstruction due to its superior performance over traditional methods, particularly in handling higher acceleration factors, highlighting its potential for real-world clini- cal applications. However, current deep learning methods remain limited in generalizability. CMR scans exhibit wide variability in image contrast, sampling patterns, scanner vendors, anatomical structures, and disease types. Most existing models are designed to handle only a single or nar- row subset of these variations, leading to performance degradation when faced with distribution shifts. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop a unified model capable of generalizing across diverse CMR scenarios. To this end, we propose CRUNet-MR-Univ, a foundation model that lever- ages spatio-temporal correlations and prompt-based priors to effectively handle the full diversity of CMR scans. Our approach consistently out- performs baseline methods across a wide range of settings, highlighting its effectiveness and promise.

*Xingjian Diao,Zheyuan Liu,Chunhui Zhang,Weiyi Wu,Keyi Kong,Lin Shi,Kaize Ding,Soroush Vosoughi,Jiang Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPRO improves LVLM efficiency and accuracy by dynamically routing computation among fast, perception, and reasoning paths, addressing visual perception failures as a key bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often overthink, leading to inefficiency and degraded accuracy due to verbose responses. Prior work misses the bottleneck of visual perception failures, which undermines reasoning stability.

Method: Proposes Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO), a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation across three paths: fast, perception (re-examines visuals), and reasoning (self-reflection). Uses teacher models for failure attribution and trains with reinforcement learning to balance accuracy and cost.

Result: GPRO significantly enhances accuracy and efficiency on five benchmarks, outperforming slow-thinking methods with shorter responses.

Conclusion: Addressing visual perception failures through dynamic computation routing (GPRO) effectively improves LVLM performance, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought mechanisms that generate step-by-step rationales. However, such slow-thinking approaches often lead to overthinking, where models produce excessively verbose responses even for simple queries, resulting in test-time inefficiency and even degraded accuracy. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue via adaptive reasoning strategies, but these methods largely overlook a fundamental bottleneck: visual perception failures. We argue that stable reasoning critically depends on low-level visual grounding, and that reasoning errors often originate from imperfect perception rather than insufficient deliberation. To address this limitation, we propose Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO), a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation among three decision paths at each generation step: a lightweight fast path, a slow perception path for re-examining visual inputs, and a slow reasoning path for internal self-reflection. To learn this distinction, we derive large-scale failure attribution supervision from approximately 790k samples, using teacher models to distinguish perceptual hallucinations from reasoning errors. We then train the controller with multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize the trade-off between task accuracy and computational cost under uncertainty. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that GPRO substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency, outperforming recent slow-thinking methods while generating significantly shorter responses.

TL;DR: UniDrive-WM integrates perception, prediction, and planning into a single VLM-based world model for autonomous driving, outperforming prior methods in trajectory planning and collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of treating perception, prediction, and planning as separate modules in autonomous driving, UniDrive-WM aims to unify these tasks using a vision-language model (VLM).

Method: UniDrive-WM combines driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and future image generation within a single architecture. It uses predicted trajectories to condition future frame generation, enhancing iterative refinement.

Result: On the Bench2Drive benchmark, UniDrive-WM reduces L2 trajectory error by 5.9% and collision rate by 9.2%, producing high-fidelity future images.

Conclusion: UniDrive-WM demonstrates the benefits of unified VLM-driven reasoning and generative world modeling for autonomous driving, improving planning and scene understanding.

Abstract: World models have become central to autonomous driving, where accurate scene understanding and future prediction are crucial for safe control. Recent work has explored using vision-language models (VLMs) for planning, yet existing approaches typically treat perception, prediction, and planning as separate modules. We propose UniDrive-WM, a unified VLM-based world model that jointly performs driving-scene understanding, trajectory planning, and trajectory-conditioned future image generation within a single architecture. UniDrive-WM's trajectory planner predicts a future trajectory, which conditions a VLM-based image generator to produce plausible future frames. These predictions provide additional supervisory signals that enhance scene understanding and iteratively refine trajectory generation. We further compare discrete and continuous output representations for future image prediction, analyzing their influence on downstream driving performance. Experiments on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark show that UniDrive-WM produces high-fidelity future images and improves planning performance by 5.9% in L2 trajectory error and 9.2% in collision rate over the previous best method. These results demonstrate the advantages of tightly integrating VLM-driven reasoning, planning, and generative world modeling for autonomous driving.

*James Brock,Ce Zhang,Nantheera Anantrasirichai*

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-driven agent for forest change analysis, combining vision-language models and natural language querying, supported by a new Forest-Change dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in pixel-level change detection and semantic change captioning for forest dynamics by integrating LLMs with vision-language models.

Method: Developed an LLM-driven agent with a multi-level change interpretation backbone, evaluated using the Forest-Change dataset and LEVIR-MCI-Trees subset.

Result: Achieved mIoU scores of 67.10% and 88.13%, and BLEU-4 scores of 40.17% and 34.41% on the respective datasets.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates potential for improving forest change analysis accessibility and interpretability.

Abstract: Modern forest monitoring workflows increasingly benefit from the growing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery and advances in deep learning. Two persistent challenges in this context are accurate pixel-level change detection and meaningful semantic change captioning for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are being adapted for interactive data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an LLM-driven agent for integrated forest change analysis that supports natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks. The proposed system builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we further introduce the Forest-Change dataset, which comprises bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated using a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves mIoU and BLEU-4 scores of 67.10% and 40.17% on the Forest-Change dataset, and 88.13% and 34.41% on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI benchmark for joint change detection and captioning. These results highlight the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and efficiency of forest change analysis.

*Sen Zeng,Hong Zhou,Zheng Zhu,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSeg is a boundary-aware sparse token framework for efficient 3D medical image segmentation, reducing computational demands while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing computational inefficiency in 3D medical image segmentation due to voxel processing and redundant computations on homogeneous regions.

Method: Uses a multi-scale hierarchical encoder, boundary-aware tokenizer, and sparse-to-dense decoder to focus on salient tokens near boundaries, reducing redundancy.

Result: Achieves 94.49% Dice and 89.61% IoU on breast DCE-MRI, with 64% lower GPU memory and 68% faster inference, and generalizes well to other datasets.

Conclusion: TokenSeg demonstrates anatomically informed sparse representation effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in 3D medical segmentation.

Abstract: Three-dimensional medical image segmentation is a fundamental yet computationally demanding task due to the cubic growth of voxel processing and the redundant computation on homogeneous regions. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TokenSeg}, a boundary-aware sparse token representation framework for efficient 3D medical volume segmentation. Specifically, (1) we design a \emph{multi-scale hierarchical encoder} that extracts 400 candidate tokens across four resolution levels to capture both global anatomical context and fine boundary details; (2) we introduce a \emph{boundary-aware tokenizer} that combines VQ-VAE quantization with importance scoring to select 100 salient tokens, over 60\% of which lie near tumor boundaries; and (3) we develop a \emph{sparse-to-dense decoder} that reconstructs full-resolution masks through token reprojection, progressive upsampling, and skip connections. Extensive experiments on a 3D breast DCE-MRI dataset comprising 960 cases demonstrate that TokenSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance with 94.49\% Dice and 89.61\% IoU, while reducing GPU memory and inference latency by 64\% and 68\%, respectively. To verify the generalization capability, our evaluations on MSD cardiac and brain MRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that TokenSeg consistently delivers optimal performance across heterogeneous anatomical structures. These results highlight the effectiveness of anatomically informed sparse representation for accurate and efficient 3D medical image segmentation.

### [18] [FaceRefiner: High-Fidelity Facial Texture Refinement with Differentiable Rendering-based Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04520)
*Chengyang Li,Baoping Cheng,Yao Cheng,Haocheng Zhang,Renshuai Liu,Yinglin Zheng,Jing Liao,Xuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceRefiner improves facial texture generation by using style transfer to preserve details, structure, and identity from input images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with generalization for in-the-wild images, leading to inconsistencies in facial details and identity.

Method: FaceRefiner uses multi-level style transfer with differentiable rendering to refine textures.

Result: Improved texture quality and better identity preservation on Multi-PIE, CelebA, and FFHQ datasets.

Conclusion: FaceRefiner effectively enhances facial texture generation by leveraging multi-level style transfer.

Abstract: Recent facial texture generation methods prefer to use deep networks to synthesize image content and then fill in the UV map, thus generating a compelling full texture from a single image. Nevertheless, the synthesized texture UV map usually comes from a space constructed by the training data or the 2D face generator, which limits the methods' generalization ability for in-the-wild input images. Consequently, their facial details, structures and identity may not be consistent with the input. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a style transfer-based facial texture refinement method named FaceRefiner. FaceRefiner treats the 3D sampled texture as style and the output of a texture generation method as content. The photo-realistic style is then expected to be transferred from the style image to the content image. Different from current style transfer methods that only transfer high and middle level information to the result, our style transfer method integrates differentiable rendering to also transfer low level (or pixel level) information in the visible face regions. The main benefit of such multi-level information transfer is that, the details, structures and semantics in the input can thus be well preserved. The extensive experiments on Multi-PIE, CelebA and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that our refinement method can improve the texture quality and the face identity preserving ability, compared with state-of-the-arts.

*Ziyou Jiang,Mingyang Li,Junjie Wang,Yuekai Huang,Jie Huang,Zhiyuan Chang,Zhaoyang Li,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepMD is a method for detecting harmful memes by analyzing invariant design principles, achieving 81.1% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harmful memes evolve rapidly, making them hard to analyze. Their underlying design concepts, however, remain consistent and can aid detection.

Method: RepMD uses a Design Concept Graph (DCG) derived from historical memes, combined with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), to detect harmful memes.

Result: RepMD achieves 81.1% accuracy and maintains performance with evolving meme types. Human evaluation shows it speeds up detection.

Conclusion: RepMD effectively detects harmful memes by leveraging invariant design principles, proving useful for both automated and human analysis.

Abstract: Harmful memes are ever-shifting in the Internet communities, which are difficult to analyze due to their type-shifting and temporal-evolving nature. Although these memes are shifting, we find that different memes may share invariant principles, i.e., the underlying design concept of malicious users, which can help us analyze why these memes are harmful. In this paper, we propose RepMD, an ever-shifting harmful meme detection method based on the design concept reproduction. We first refer to the attack tree to define the Design Concept Graph (DCG), which describes steps that people may take to design a harmful meme. Then, we derive the DCG from historical memes with design step reproduction and graph pruning. Finally, we use DCG to guide the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to detect harmful memes. The evaluation results show that RepMD achieves the highest accuracy with 81.1% and has slight accuracy decreases when generalized to type-shifting and temporal-evolving memes. Human evaluation shows that RepMD can improve the efficiency of human discovery on harmful memes, with 15$\sim$30 seconds per meme.

*Yusri Al-Sanaani,Rebecca Thornhill,Sreeraman Rajan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using 3D conditional generative models (Pix2Pix GAN, SPADE-GAN, SPADE-LDM) to augment scarce LGE MRI data for improving left atrial segmentation, with SPADE-LDM showing superior performance and significant improvement in segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of the left atrial wall and endocardium from LGE MRI is critical but challenging due to limited data and complex anatomy. Synthetic data generation is proposed to address this gap.

Method: A pipeline synthesizes 3D LGE MRI volumes from semantic label maps using three generative models (Pix2Pix GAN, SPADE-GAN, SPADE-LDM). Synthetic images are evaluated for realism and their impact on LA segmentation.

Result: SPADE-LDM outperforms others with an FID of 4.063. Augmenting training data with synthetic images improves LA cavity segmentation Dice score from 0.908 to 0.936, statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: Label-conditioned 3D synthesis, especially SPADE-LDM, effectively enhances segmentation of under-represented cardiac structures.

Abstract: Segmentation of the left atrial (LA) wall and endocardium from late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) MRI is essential for quantifying atrial fibrosis in patients with atrial fibrillation. The development of accurate machine learning-based segmentation models remains challenging due to the limited availability of data and the complexity of anatomical structures. In this work, we investigate 3D conditional generative models as potential solution for augmenting scarce LGE training data and improving LA segmentation performance. We develop a pipeline to synthesize high-fidelity 3D LGE MRI volumes from composite semantic label maps combining anatomical expert annotations with unsupervised tissue clusters, using three 3D conditional generators (Pix2Pix GAN, SPADE-GAN, and SPADE-LDM). The synthetic images are evaluated for realism and their impact on downstream LA segmentation. SPADE-LDM generates the most realistic and structurally accurate images, achieving an FID of 4.063 and surpassing GAN models, which have FIDs of 40.821 and 7.652 for Pix2Pix and SPADE-GAN, respectively. When augmented with synthetic LGE images, the Dice score for LA cavity segmentation with a 3D U-Net model improved from 0.908 to 0.936, showing a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) over the baseline.These findings demonstrate the potential of label-conditioned 3D synthesis to enhance the segmentation of under-represented cardiac structures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiLDEAgent addresses multi-layer design document editing with layer-aware reasoning, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Editing multi-layered design documents (e.g., posters) from natural-language instructions requires fine-grained reasoning, which prior work lacks.

Method: Introduces MiLDEAgent, combining an RL-trained multimodal reasoner for layer-wise understanding and an image editor for modifications, along with MiLDEBench/MiLDEEval for benchmarking.

Result: MiLDEAgent outperforms 14 open-source and 2 closed-source models, achieving strong layer-aware reasoning and precise editing.

Conclusion: MiLDEAgent sets the first strong baseline for multi-layer document editing, bridging the gap in layer-aware reasoning.

Abstract: Real-world design documents (e.g., posters) are inherently multi-layered, combining decoration, text, and images. Editing them from natural-language instructions requires fine-grained, layer-aware reasoning to identify relevant layers and coordinate modifications. Prior work largely overlooks multi-layer design document editing, focusing instead on single-layer image editing or multi-layer generation, which assume a flat canvas and lack the reasoning needed to determine what and where to modify. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-Layer Document Editing Agent (MiLDEAgent), a reasoning-based framework that combines an RL-trained multimodal reasoner for layer-wise understanding with an image editor for targeted modifications. To systematically benchmark this setting, we introduce the MiLDEBench, a human-in-the-loop corpus of over 20K design documents paired with diverse editing instructions. The benchmark is complemented by a task-specific evaluation protocol, MiLDEEval, which spans four dimensions including instruction following, layout consistency, aesthetics, and text rendering. Extensive experiments on 14 open-source and 2 closed-source models reveal that existing approaches fail to generalize: open-source models often cannot complete multi-layer document editing tasks, while closed-source models suffer from format violations. In contrast, MiLDEAgent achieves strong layer-aware reasoning and precise editing, significantly outperforming all open-source baselines and attaining performance comparable to closed-source models, thereby establishing the first strong baseline for multi-layer document editing.

TL;DR: This paper explores operational uncertainties in AI-enabled human-centric cyber-physical systems, proposes a safety framework, and demonstrates a technique for detecting unannounced meals in diabetes control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-centric systems like medical monitoring and autonomous cars face safety risks due to uncertain operational conditions caused by human-system interactions.

Method: The paper discusses operational deviations, develops a framework for safety evaluation, and introduces an image-based technique for meal detection in diabetes control.

Result: A framework is created to assess safety strategies, and a novel meal detection technique is demonstrated.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for robust safety measures in AI-enabled human-centric systems and provides a practical example in diabetes management.

Abstract: In recent years, Human-centric cyber-physical systems have increasingly involved artificial intelligence to enable knowledge extraction from sensor-collected data. Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, as well as autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate according to the protocols and guidelines for regular system operations. However, in many scenarios, such as closed-loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoring systems for stroke diagnosis. The operations of such AI-enabled human-centric applications can expose them to cases for which their operational mode may be uncertain, for instance, resulting from the interactions with a human with the system. Such cases, in which the system is in uncertain conditions, can violate the system's safety and security requirements. 
  This paper will discuss operational deviations that can lead these systems to operate in unknown conditions. We will then create a framework to evaluate different strategies for ensuring the safety and security of AI-enabled human-centric cyber-physical systems in operation deployment. Then, as an example, we show a personalized image-based novel technique for detecting the non-announcement of meals in closed-loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes HUR-MACL, a model combining Vision Mamba and Deformable CNN to improve segmentation accuracy for small, complex organs in the head and neck by focusing on high uncertainty regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of head and neck organs is crucial for radiation therapy, but existing deep learning models struggle with small, complex organs due to redundant feature concatenation.

Method: HUR-MACL identifies high uncertainty regions using CNN, then employs Vision Mamba and Deformable CNN for these regions, aided by a heterogeneous feature distillation loss.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results on two public and one private dataset.

Conclusion: HUR-MACL effectively addresses segmentation challenges by leveraging collaborative learning in uncertain regions, improving accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs at risk in the head and neck is essential for radiation therapy, yet deep learning models often fail on small, complexly shaped organs. While hybrid architectures that combine different models show promise, they typically just concatenate features without exploiting the unique strengths of each component. This results in functional overlap and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a high uncertainty region-guided multi-architecture collaborative learning (HUR-MACL) model for multi-organ segmentation in the head and neck. This model adaptively identifies high uncertainty regions using a convolutional neural network, and for these regions, Vision Mamba as well as Deformable CNN are utilized to jointly improve their segmentation accuracy. Additionally, a heterogeneous feature distillation loss was proposed to promote collaborative learning between the two architectures in high uncertainty regions to further enhance performance. Our method achieves SOTA results on two public datasets and one private dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperAlign uses hyperbolic geometry to improve text-to-image alignment assessment, outperforming traditional Euclidean metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing text-to-image alignment rely on Euclidean metrics and lack adaptability, prompting the need for a more structured and adaptive approach.

Method: HyperAlign maps CLIP-extracted features to hyperbolic space, employs dynamic-supervision entailment modeling, and uses an adaptive modulation regressor to calibrate similarity scores.

Result: HyperAlign achieves competitive performance in single and cross-database evaluations.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometric modeling effectively enhances image-text alignment assessment.

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-image generation technology, accurately assessing the alignment between generated images and text prompts has become a critical challenge. Existing methods rely on Euclidean space metrics, neglecting the structured nature of semantic alignment, while lacking adaptive capabilities for different samples. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, an adaptive text-to-image alignment assessment framework based on hyperbolic entailment geometry. First, we extract Euclidean features using CLIP and map them to hyperbolic space. Second, we design a dynamic-supervision entailment modeling mechanism that transforms discrete entailment logic into continuous geometric structure supervision. Finally, we propose an adaptive modulation regressor that utilizes hyperbolic geometric features to generate sample-level modulation parameters, adaptively calibrating Euclidean cosine similarity to predict the final score. HyperAlign achieves highly competitive performance on both single database evaluation and cross-database generalization tasks, fully validating the effectiveness of hyperbolic geometric modeling for image-text alignment assessment.

TL;DR: Agri-R1 is a reasoning-enhanced large model for agriculture that automates high-quality reasoning data generation and uses GRPO training to improve disease recognition and knowledge QA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural disease diagnosis is challenging due to the need for extensive labels, lack of interpretability, and poor generalization. Existing methods rely on costly expert annotations and fail to address diverse agricultural queries.

Method: Agri-R1 uses vision-language synthesis and LLM-based filtering to generate reasoning data (only 19% of samples). Training employs GRPO with a novel reward integrating domain-specific lexicons and fuzzy matching.

Result: The 3B-parameter model outperforms larger baselines: +23.2% in disease recognition, +33.3% in QA, and +26.10-point improvement in cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Synergy between structured reasoning data and GRPO-driven exploration underpins Agri-R1's gains, scaling benefits with question complexity.

Abstract: Agricultural disease diagnosis challenges VLMs, as conventional fine-tuning requires extensive labels, lacks interpretability, and generalizes poorly. While reasoning improves model robustness, existing methods rely on costly expert annotations and rarely address the open-ended, diverse nature of agricultural queries. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Agri-R1}, a reasoning-enhanced large model for agriculture. Our framework automates high-quality reasoning data generation via vision-language synthesis and LLM-based filtering, using only 19\% of available samples. Training employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel proposed reward function that integrates domain-specific lexicons and fuzzy matching to assess both correctness and linguistic flexibility in open-ended responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, our resulting 3B-parameter model achieves performance competitive with 7B- to 13B-parameter baselines, showing a +23.2\% relative gain in disease recognition accuracy, +33.3\% in agricultural knowledge QA, and a +26.10-point improvement in cross-domain generalization over standard fine-tuning. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy between structured reasoning data and GRPO-driven exploration underpins these gains, with benefits scaling as question complexity increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HATIR is a novel method for turbulent infrared video super-resolution (VSR) that jointly models turbulence and resolution degradation using heat-aware priors and diffusion, outperforming existing decoupled approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VSR methods fail to address the modality gap between infrared and visible images or turbulence-induced distortions, leading to error propagation when cascading turbulence mitigation with VSR.

Method: HATIR introduces heat-aware priors into diffusion sampling, using a Phasor-Guided Flow Estimator for turbulence-aware flow and a Turbulence-Aware Decoder for stable structural recovery.

Result: HATIR effectively restores turbulence-distorted infrared videos, validated by the new FLIR-IVSR dataset of 640 diverse scenes with paired LR-HR sequences.

Conclusion: HATIR advances infrared VSR by unifying turbulence and resolution modeling, with potential to inspire future research.

Abstract: Infrared video has been of great interest in visual tasks under challenging environments, but often suffers from severe atmospheric turbulence and compression degradation. Existing video super-resolution (VSR) methods either neglect the inherent modality gap between infrared and visible images or fail to restore turbulence-induced distortions. Directly cascading turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms with VSR methods leads to error propagation and accumulation due to the decoupled modeling of degradation between turbulence and resolution. We introduce HATIR, a Heat-Aware Diffusion for Turbulent InfraRed Video Super-Resolution, which injects heat-aware deformation priors into the diffusion sampling path to jointly model the inverse process of turbulent degradation and structural detail loss. Specifically, HATIR constructs a Phasor-Guided Flow Estimator, rooted in the physical principle that thermally active regions exhibit consistent phasor responses over time, enabling reliable turbulence-aware flow to guide the reverse diffusion process. To ensure the fidelity of structural recovery under nonuniform distortions, a Turbulence-Aware Decoder is proposed to selectively suppress unstable temporal cues and enhance edge-aware feature aggregation via turbulence gating and structure-aware attention. We built FLIR-IVSR, the first dataset for turbulent infrared VSR, comprising paired LR-HR sequences from a FLIR T1050sc camera (1024 X 768) spanning 640 diverse scenes with varying camera and object motion conditions. This encourages future research in infrared VSR. Project page: https://github.com/JZ0606/HATIR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency trading requires timely integration of diverse data sources and robust risk management, but existing systems struggle with noise and rapid market shocks.

Method: Proposes WebCryptoAgent, using modality-specific agents for data synthesis and a decoupled control architecture for real-time risk management.

Result: Demonstrates improved trading stability, reduced spurious activity, and better tail-risk handling in real-world cryptocurrency markets.

Conclusion: WebCryptoAgent effectively addresses key challenges in cryptocurrency trading, offering a scalable and robust solution.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading increasingly depends on timely integration of heterogeneous web information and market microstructure signals to support short-horizon decision making under extreme volatility. However, existing trading systems struggle to jointly reason over noisy multi-source web evidence while maintaining robustness to rapid price shocks at sub-second timescales. The first challenge lies in synthesizing unstructured web content, social sentiment, and structured OHLCV signals into coherent and interpretable trading decisions without amplifying spurious correlations, while the second challenge concerns risk control, as slow deliberative reasoning pipelines are ill-suited for handling abrupt market shocks that require immediate defensive responses. To address these challenges, we propose WebCryptoAgent, an agentic trading framework that decomposes web-informed decision making into modality-specific agents and consolidates their outputs into a unified evidence document for confidence-calibrated reasoning. We further introduce a decoupled control architecture that separates strategic hourly reasoning from a real-time second-level risk model, enabling fast shock detection and protective intervention independent of the trading loop. Extensive experiments on real-world cryptocurrency markets demonstrate that WebCryptoAgent improves trading stability, reduces spurious activity, and enhances tail-risk handling compared to existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Forge-and-Quench, a framework integrating understanding models to enhance image generation fidelity and detail without compromising understanding capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to explore how understanding models can improve image generation, focusing on fidelity and detail richness rather than just reasoning or world knowledge.

Method: The framework uses an MLLM to refine text instructions, maps them to a visual Bridge Feature via a Bridge Adapter, and injects this into a T2I model for guided generation.

Result: Forge-and-Quench improves image fidelity and detail across models while maintaining instruction-following accuracy and enhancing world knowledge application.

Conclusion: The framework is extensible and flexible, allowing efficient migration across models with minimal training overhead, demonstrating significant improvements in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Integrating image generation and understanding into a single framework has become a pivotal goal in the multimodal domain. However, how understanding can effectively assist generation has not been fully explored. Unlike previous works that focus on leveraging reasoning abilities and world knowledge from understanding models, this paper introduces a novel perspective: leveraging understanding to enhance the fidelity and detail richness of generated images. To this end, we propose Forge-and-Quench, a new unified framework that puts this principle into practice. In the generation process of our framework, an MLLM first reasons over the entire conversational context, including text instructions, to produce an enhanced text instruction. This refined instruction is then mapped to a virtual visual representation, termed the Bridge Feature, via a novel Bridge Adapter. This feature acts as a crucial link, forging insights from the understanding model to quench and refine the generation process. It is subsequently injected into the T2I backbone as a visual guidance signal, alongside the enhanced text instruction that replaces the original input. To validate this paradigm, we conduct comprehensive studies on the design of the Bridge Feature and Bridge Adapter. Our framework demonstrates exceptional extensibility and flexibility, enabling efficient migration across different MLLM and T2I models with significant savings in training overhead, all without compromising the MLLM's inherent multimodal understanding capabilities. Experiments show that Forge-and-Quench significantly improves image fidelity and detail across multiple models, while also maintaining instruction-following accuracy and enhancing world knowledge application.

TL;DR: HuForDet is a holistic framework for detecting human image forgeries, combining face and full-body detection branches, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods are fragmented and fail to generalize across all human image manipulations.

Method: HuForDet uses a dual-branch architecture: face forgery detection in RGB/frequency domains and contextualized full-body detection via MLLM.

Result: HuForDet achieves state-of-the-art performance and robustness on diverse human image forgeries.

Conclusion: HuForDet provides a comprehensive solution for detecting human image forgeries, bridging the gap between face and full-body detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC) has escalated the threat of deepfakes, from facial manipulations to the synthesis of entire photorealistic human bodies. However, existing detection methods remain fragmented, specializing either in facial-region forgeries or full-body synthetic images, and consequently fail to generalize across the full spectrum of human image manipulations. We introduce HuForDet, a holistic framework for human image forgery detection, which features a dual-branch architecture comprising: (1) a face forgery detection branch that employs heterogeneous experts operating in both RGB and frequency domains, including an adaptive Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) module designed to capture artifacts ranging from fine-grained blending boundaries to coarse-scale texture irregularities; and (2) a contextualized forgery detection branch that leverages a Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to analyze full-body semantic consistency, enhanced with a confidence estimation mechanism that dynamically weights its contribution during feature fusion. We curate a human image forgery (HuFor) dataset that unifies existing face forgery data with a new corpus of full-body synthetic humans. Extensive experiments show that our HuForDet achieves state-of-the-art forgery detection performance and superior robustness across diverse human image forgeries.

Unlike traditional manual feature engineering methods, CNNs automatically extract hierarchical visual patterns, enabling strong performance across diverse real-world contexts. This study investigates the effectiveness of CNN-based architectures across five heterogeneous datasets spanning agricultural and urban domains: mango variety classification, paddy variety identification, road surface condition assessment, auto-rickshaw detection, and footpath encroachment monitoring. These datasets introduce varying challenges, including differences in illumination, resolution, environmental complexity, and class imbalance, necessitating adaptable and robust learning models.
  We evaluate a lightweight, task-specific custom CNN alongside established deep architectures, including ResNet-18 and VGG-16, trained both from scratch and using transfer learning. Through systematic preprocessing, augmentation, and controlled experimentation, we analyze how architectural complexity, model depth, and pre-training influence convergence, generalization, and performance across datasets of differing scale and difficulty. The key contributions of this work are: (1) the development of an efficient custom CNN that achieves competitive performance across multiple application domains, and (2) a comprehensive comparative analysis highlighting when transfer learning and deep architectures provide substantial advantages, particularly in data-constrained environments. These findings offer practical insights for deploying deep learning models in resource-limited yet high-impact real-world visual classification tasks.

Motivation: Address challenges in precise object localization and resource-constrained edge-cloud deployment for MLLMs.

Method: Propose AIVD framework with lightweight edge detectors, fine-tuning strategy for robustness, and dynamic scheduling algorithm.

Result: Reduces resource consumption, improves classification accuracy, and enhances semantic generation quality.

Conclusion: AIVD effectively balances performance and efficiency in MLLMs for edge-cloud environments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities in semantic understanding and visual reasoning, yet they still face challenges in precise object localization and resource-constrained edge-cloud deployment. To address this, this paper proposes the AIVD framework, which achieves unified precise localization and high-quality semantic generation through the collaboration between lightweight edge detectors and cloud-based MLLMs. To enhance the cloud MLLM's robustness against edge cropped-box noise and scenario variations, we design an efficient fine-tuning strategy with visual-semantic collaborative augmentation, significantly improving classification accuracy and semantic consistency. Furthermore, to maintain high throughput and low latency across heterogeneous edge devices and dynamic network conditions, we propose a heterogeneous resource-aware dynamic scheduling algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that AIVD substantially reduces resource consumption while improving MLLM classification performance and semantic generation quality. The proposed scheduling strategy also achieves higher throughput and lower latency across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding by addressing cross-view consistency and intra-mask cohesion efficiently without render-supervised fine-tuning.

Method: ProFuse introduces a dense correspondence-guided pre-registration phase to initialize Gaussians with accurate geometry and constructs 3D Context Proposals via cross-view clustering. Semantic fusion leverages global features for language coherence without additional optimization.

Result: ProFuse achieves strong open-vocabulary understanding and completes semantic attachment in about five minutes per scene, twice as fast as state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ProFuse demonstrates an efficient and effective approach for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding, balancing speed and accuracy.

Abstract: We present ProFuse, an efficient context-aware framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The pipeline enhances cross-view consistency and intra-mask cohesion within a direct registration setup, adding minimal overhead and requiring no render-supervised fine-tuning. Instead of relying on a pretrained 3DGS scene, we introduce a dense correspondence-guided pre-registration phase that initializes Gaussians with accurate geometry while jointly constructing 3D Context Proposals via cross-view clustering. Each proposal carries a global feature obtained through weighted aggregation of member embeddings, and this feature is fused onto Gaussians during direct registration to maintain per-primitive language coherence across views. With associations established in advance, semantic fusion requires no additional optimization beyond standard reconstruction, and the model retains geometric refinement without densification. ProFuse achieves strong open-vocabulary 3DGS understanding while completing semantic attachment in about five minutes per scene, which is two times faster than SOTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GeM-VG, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for Generalized Multi-image Visual Grounding, addressing limitations of current methods by introducing a unified task categorization, MG-Data-240K dataset, and hybrid reinforcement finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-image grounding methods are limited by single-target localization and lack unified modeling for generalized tasks, prompting the need for a robust solution.

Method: Systematic task categorization, MG-Data-240K dataset creation, and a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy combining chain-of-thought reasoning and direct answering.

Result: GeM-VG outperforms leading MLLMs by 2.0% and 9.7% on MIG-Bench and MC-Bench for multi-image grounding, and improves single-image grounding by 9.1% on ODINW.

Conclusion: GeM-VG demonstrates superior generalized grounding capabilities while retaining strong multi-image understanding, validated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive progress in single-image grounding and general multi-image understanding. Recently, some methods begin to address multi-image grounding. However, they are constrained by single-target localization and limited types of practical tasks, due to the lack of unified modeling for generalized grounding tasks. Therefore, we propose GeM-VG, an MLLM capable of Generalized Multi-image Visual Grounding. To support this, we systematically categorize and organize existing multi-image grounding tasks according to their reliance of cross-image cues and reasoning, and introduce the MG-Data-240K dataset, addressing the limitations of existing datasets regarding target quantity and image relation. To tackle the challenges of robustly handling diverse multi-image grounding tasks, we further propose a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and direct answering, considering their complementary strengths. This strategy adopts an R1-like algorithm guided by a carefully designed rule-based reward, effectively enhancing the model's overall perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalized grounding capabilities of our model. For multi-image grounding, it outperforms the previous leading MLLMs by 2.0% and 9.7% on MIG-Bench and MC-Bench, respectively. In single-image grounding, it achieves a 9.1% improvement over the base model on ODINW. Furthermore, our model retains strong capabilities in general multi-image understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-language models struggle with hallucinations, particularly in reasoning about actions and temporal order, due to over-reliance on language priors rather than visual dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a framework for counterfactual video generation using multimodal LLMs and diffusion models to create semantic hard negatives. They build CounterVid (~26k preference pairs) and introduce MixDPO for joint preference optimization.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL with MixDPO improves performance, especially in temporal ordering, and transfers well to video hallucination benchmarks.

Conclusion: The scalable framework and MixDPO effectively mitigate hallucinations in video-language models by addressing visual dynamics and leveraging synthetic data.

Abstract: Video-language models (VLMs) achieve strong multimodal understanding but remain prone to hallucinations, especially when reasoning about actions and temporal order. Existing mitigation strategies, such as textual filtering or random video perturbations, often fail to address the root cause: over-reliance on language priors rather than fine-grained visual dynamics. We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context. Our pipeline combines multimodal LLMs for action proposal and editing guidance with diffusion-based image and video models to generate semantic hard negatives at scale. Using this framework, we build CounterVid, a synthetic dataset of ~26k preference pairs targeting action recognition and temporal reasoning. We further introduce MixDPO, a unified Direct Preference Optimization approach that jointly leverages textual and visual preferences. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL with MixDPO yields consistent improvements, notably in temporal ordering, and transfers effectively to standard video hallucination benchmarks. Code and models will be made publicly available.

*Akbar Saadat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper validates the Gaussian model's accuracy for defocus blur estimation in 3D recovery, showing less than 1% error in typical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate depth estimation from 2D images is challenging; the Gaussian model offers simplicity and efficiency for real-time applications.

Method: Analysis combines geometric optics and diffraction-limited theory to fit the Gaussian model to real defocus blur.

Result: For depths between 1-100 meters, the Gaussian model shows a maximum MAE of less than 1%, proving its reliability.

Conclusion: The Gaussian model is highly accurate and suitable for defocus operators in most imaging devices.

Abstract: Over the past three decades, defocus has consistently provided groundbreaking depth information in scene images. However, accurately estimating depth from 2D images continues to be a persistent and fundamental challenge in the field of 3D recovery. Heuristic approaches involve with the ill-posed problem for inferring the spatial variant defocusing blur, as the desired blur cannot be distinguished from the inherent blur. Given a prior knowledge of the defocus model, the problem become well-posed with an analytic solution for the relative blur between two images, taken at the same viewpoint with different camera settings for the focus. The Gaussian model stands out as an optimal choice for real-time applications, due to its mathematical simplicity and computational efficiency. And theoretically, it is the only model can be applied at the same time to both the absolute blur caused by depth in a single image and the relative blur resulting from depth differences between two images. This paper introduces the settings, for conventional imaging devices, to ensure that the defocusing operator adheres to the Gaussian model. Defocus analysis begins within the framework of geometric optics and is conducted by defocus aberration theory in diffraction-limited optics to obtain the accuracy of fitting the actual model to its Gaussian approximation. The results for a typical set of focused depths between $1$ and $100$ meters, with a maximum depth variation of $10\%$ at the focused depth, confirm the Gaussian model's applicability for defocus operators in most imaging devices. The findings demonstrate a maximum Mean Absolute Error $(\!M\!A\!E)$ of less than $1\%$, underscoring the model's accuracy and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI's clinical use is limited by long acquisition time, high cost, and resolution constraints. Image translation, particularly Pix2Pix, offers a solution but lacks full exploration.

Method: Proposed framework combines SEResNet for feature enhancement via channel attention and U-Net++ for multi-scale feature fusion, with a simplified PatchGAN discriminator.

Result: Under few-shot conditions (<500 images), the method achieves consistent structural fidelity and superior image quality in intra-modality MRI translation.

Conclusion: The enhanced Pix2Pix framework effectively addresses MRI translation challenges, demonstrating strong generalization and potential clinical utility.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides detailed tissue information, but its clinical application is limited by long acquisition time, high cost, and restricted resolution. Image translation has recently gained attention as a strategy to address these limitations. Although Pix2Pix has been widely applied in medical image translation, its potential has not been fully explored. In this study, we propose an enhanced Pix2Pix framework that integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual Networks (SEResNet) and U-Net++ to improve image generation quality and structural fidelity. SEResNet strengthens critical feature representation through channel attention, while U-Net++ enhances multi-scale feature fusion. A simplified PatchGAN discriminator further stabilizes training and refines local anatomical realism. Experimental results demonstrate that under few-shot conditions with fewer than 500 images, the proposed method achieves consistent structural fidelity and superior image quality across multiple intra-modality MRI translation tasks, showing strong generalization ability. These results suggest an effective extension of Pix2Pix for medical image translation.

*Lee Hyoseok,Sohwi Lim,Eunju Cha,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCLC is introduced as a correction module for LDMs to stabilize inverse problem solving by reducing discrepancies in diffusion dynamics, outperforming prior methods tied to linear assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent diffusion inverse solvers suffer from instability, artifacts, and degraded quality due to discrepancies in diffusion dynamics.

Method: Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC) is proposed, a plug-and-play module using Langevin updates to stabilize LDMs without relying on linear manifold assumptions.

Result: MCLC improves stability and reliability across diverse image restoration tasks, addressing blob artifacts effectively.

Conclusion: MCLC advances zero-shot inverse problem solving by providing a robust correction mechanism for LDMs.

Abstract: With recent advances in generative models, diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems in each domain. Since Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) provide generic priors, several studies have explored their potential as domain-agnostic zero-shot inverse solvers. Despite these efforts, existing latent diffusion inverse solvers suffer from their instability, exhibiting undesirable artifacts and degraded quality. In this work, we first identify the instability as a discrepancy between the solver's and true reverse diffusion dynamics, and show that reducing this gap stabilizes the solver. Building on this, we introduce Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC), a theoretically grounded plug-and-play correction module that remedies the LDM-based inverse solvers through measurement-consistent Langevin updates. Compared to prior approaches that rely on linear manifold assumptions, which often do not hold in latent space, MCLC operates without this assumption, leading to more stable and reliable behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of MCLC and its compatibility with existing solvers across diverse image restoration tasks. Additionally, we analyze blob artifacts and offer insights into their underlying causes. We highlight that MCLC is a key step toward more robust zero-shot inverse problem solvers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline to convert pretrained diffusion models into pyramidal ones via finetuning, improving efficiency without quality loss, and explores step distillation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost and performance limitations of existing pyramidal video models, which are trained from scratch and underperform state-of-the-art systems.

Method: Proposes a low-cost finetuning pipeline to transform pretrained diffusion models into pyramidal ones and investigates step distillation strategies for efficiency.

Result: Achieves improved inference efficiency without degrading video quality, with results showcased online.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully enhances pyramidal models' efficiency and performance, leveraging pretrained models and step distillation.

Abstract: Recently proposed pyramidal models decompose the conventional forward and backward diffusion processes into multiple stages operating at varying resolutions. These models handle inputs with higher noise levels at lower resolutions, while less noisy inputs are processed at higher resolutions. This hierarchical approach significantly reduces the computational cost of inference in multi-step denoising models. However, existing open-source pyramidal video models have been trained from scratch and tend to underperform compared to state-of-the-art systems in terms of visual plausibility. In this work, we present a pipeline that converts a pretrained diffusion model into a pyramidal one through low-cost finetuning, achieving this transformation without degradation in quality of output videos. Furthermore, we investigate and compare various strategies for step distillation within pyramidal models, aiming to further enhance the inference efficiency. Our results are available at https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/PyramidalWan.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates SAMURAI for drone tracking in urban surveillance, introducing a detector-augmented extension to improve robustness, especially in long-duration sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing threat potential of drones necessitates robust tracking solutions, but existing methods lack temporal consistency and drone-specific research is limited.

Method: The study systematically evaluates SAMURAI's potential for drone tracking and introduces a detector-augmented version to address initialization and sequence length issues.

Result: The proposed extension significantly improves robustness, with success rate gains of +0.393 and FNR reductions of -0.475.

Conclusion: The detector-augmented SAMURAI is effective for drone tracking, particularly in complex urban environments and long sequences.

Abstract: Robust long-term tracking of drone is a critical requirement for modern surveillance systems, given their increasing threat potential. While detector-based approaches typically achieve strong frame-level accuracy, they often suffer from temporal inconsistencies caused by frequent detection dropouts. Despite its practical relevance, research on RGB-based drone tracking is still limited and largely reliant on conventional motion models. Meanwhile, foundation models like SAMURAI have established their effectiveness across other domains, exhibiting strong category-agnostic tracking performance. However, their applicability in drone-specific scenarios has not been investigated yet. Motivated by this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of SAMURAI's potential for robust drone tracking in urban surveillance settings. Furthermore, we introduce a detector-augmented extension of SAMURAI to mitigate sensitivity to bounding-box initialization and sequence length. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed extension significantly improves robustness in complex urban environments, with pronounced benefits in long-duration sequences - especially under drone exit-re-entry events. The incorporation of detector cues yields consistent gains over SAMURAI's zero-shot performance across datasets and metrics, with success rate improvements of up to +0.393 and FNR reductions of up to -0.475.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ancient script images suffer from noise and degradation, making them hard to read. The goal is to enhance clarity and readability.

Method: The approach combines binarization and preprocessing techniques to remove stains and enhance unclear text in ancient scripts.

Result: Classification accuracies ranged from 53.2% to 67.8% across stone, metal plate, and document scripts using K-NN and SVM classifiers.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves readability of ancient Marathi inscriptions.

Abstract: Ancient script images often suffer from severe background noise, low contrast, and degradation caused by aging and environmental effects. In many cases, the foreground text and background exhibit similar visual characteristics, making the inscriptions difficult to read. The primary objective of image enhancement is to improve the readability of such degraded ancient images. This paper presents an image enhancement approach based on binarization and complementary preprocessing techniques for removing stains and enhancing unclear ancient text. The proposed methods are evaluated on different types of ancient scripts, including inscriptions on stone, metal plates, and historical documents. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves classification accuracies of 55.7%, 62%, and 65.6% for stone, metal plate, and document scripts, respectively, using the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifier. Using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, accuracies of 53.2%, 59.5%, and 67.8% are obtained. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement method in improving the readability of ancient Marathi inscription images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOVABench, a benchmark for evaluating vehicle-related action discrimination in surveillance videos, and proposes a training-free framework using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for interpretable embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack focus on action discrimination in surveillance, prompting the creation of SOVABench.

Method: A training-free framework leverages MLLMs to generate interpretable embeddings for images and videos.

Result: The framework performs well on SOVABench and other benchmarks where contrastive models struggle.

Conclusion: MLLMs offer a promising, interpretable solution for action discrimination in surveillance, validated by SOVABench.

Abstract: Automatic identification of events and recurrent behavior analysis are critical for video surveillance. However, most existing content-based video retrieval benchmarks focus on scene-level similarity and do not evaluate the action discrimination required in surveillance. To address this gap, we introduce SOVABench (Surveillance Opposite Vehicle Actions Benchmark), a real-world retrieval benchmark built from surveillance footage and centered on vehicle-related actions. SOVABench defines two evaluation protocols (inter-pair and intra-pair) to assess cross-action discrimination and temporal direction understanding. Although action distinctions are generally intuitive for human observers, our experiments show that they remain challenging for state-of-the-art vision and multimodal models.
  Leveraging the visual reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we present a training-free framework for producing interpretable embeddings from MLLM-generated descriptions for both images and videos. The framework achieves strong performance on SOVABench as well as on several spatial and counting benchmarks where contrastive Vision-Language Models often fail. The code, annotations, and instructions to construct the benchmark are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores improving scribe identification in medieval manuscripts by replacing template matching and CNN with YOLO object detection, achieving better accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the identification of individual scribes in medieval manuscripts for dating and understanding script evolution, addressing limitations of previous methods.

Method: Replaced template matching and CNN with YOLO object detection (v5) to identify scribes by detecting letters like "a", leveraging its confidence score for reliability.

Result: YOLO extracts more letters and improves classification accuracy, with its confidence score enabling reliable identification even in new manuscripts.

Conclusion: YOLO-based scribe identification outperforms previous methods, offering a robust solution for paleographic analysis.

Abstract: Paleography is the study of ancient and historical handwriting, its key objectives include the dating of manuscripts and understanding the evolution of writing. Estimating when a document was written and tracing the development of scripts and writing styles can be aided by identifying the individual scribes who contributed to a medieval manuscript. Although digital technologies have made significant progress in this field, the general problem remains unsolved and continues to pose open challenges. ... We previously proposed an approach focused on identifying specific letters or abbreviations that characterize each writer. In that study, we considered the letter "a", as it was widely present on all pages of text and highly distinctive, according to the suggestions of expert paleographers. We used template matching techniques to detect the occurrences of the character "a" on each page and the convolutional neural network (CNN) to attribute each instance to the correct scribe. Moving from the interesting results achieved from this previous system and being aware of the limitations of the template matching technique, which requires an appropriate threshold to work, we decided to experiment in the same framework with the use of the YOLO object detection model to identify the scribe who contributed to the writing of different medieval books. We considered the fifth version of YOLO to implement the YOLO object detection model, which completely substituted the template matching and CNN used in the previous work. The experimental results demonstrate that YOLO effectively extracts a greater number of letters considered, leading to a more accurate second-stage classification. Furthermore, the YOLO confidence score provides a foundation for developing a system that applies a rejection threshold, enabling reliable writer identification even in unseen manuscripts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF segmentation methods are slow and optimization-based, lacking zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation models. DivAS aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: DivAS uses a GUI-based workflow with 2D SAM masks refined by NeRF-derived depth priors. A custom CUDA kernel aggregates masks into a 3D voxel grid in under 200ms.

Result: DivAS matches segmentation quality of optimization-based methods while being 2-2.5x faster end-to-end and up to 10x faster excluding user prompting time.

Conclusion: DivAS provides a faster, optimization-free alternative for NeRF segmentation, leveraging interactive workflows and real-time feedback.

Abstract: Existing methods for segmenting Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are often optimization-based, requiring slow per-scene training that sacrifices the zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation models. We introduce DivAS (Depth-interactive Voxel Aggregation Segmentation), an optimization-free, fully interactive framework that addresses these limitations. Our method operates via a fast GUI-based workflow where 2D SAM masks, generated from user point prompts, are refined using NeRF-derived depth priors to improve geometric accuracy and foreground-background separation. The core of our contribution is a custom CUDA kernel that aggregates these refined multi-view masks into a unified 3D voxel grid in under 200ms, enabling real-time visual feedback. This optimization-free design eliminates the need for per-scene training. Experiments on Mip-NeRF 360° and LLFF show that DivAS achieves segmentation quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while being 2-2.5x faster end-to-end, and up to an order of magnitude faster when excluding user prompting time.

TL;DR: This paper presents an industrial GenAI framework for processing large-scale multimodal pharmaceutical data, evaluates VLMs under real-world constraints, and highlights efficiency gains and bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the gap in VLM evaluations, which typically overlook long-form video processing and industrial constraints like GPU limitations.

Method: The authors developed a framework handling 200,000+ PDFs, 25,326 videos, and multilingual audio, evaluated 40+ VLMs on benchmarks, and analyzed four key findings on long-form reasoning.

Result: The framework achieved 3-8x efficiency gains with optimized attention mechanisms and identified challenges in temporal reasoning and multimodality benefits.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical insights for deploying scalable VLMs in industrial settings, emphasizing trade-offs and failure patterns rather than proposing new models.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, yet most evaluations focus on short videos and assume unconstrained computational resources. In industrial settings such as pharmaceutical content understanding, practitioners must process long-form videos under strict GPU, latency, and cost constraints, where many existing approaches fail to scale. In this work, we present an industrial GenAI framework that processes over 200,000 PDFs, 25,326 videos across eight formats (e.g., MP4, M4V, etc.), and 888 multilingual audio files in more than 20 languages. Our study makes three contributions: (i) an industrial large-scale architecture for multimodal reasoning in pharmaceutical domains; (ii) empirical analysis of over 40 VLMs on two leading benchmarks (Video-MME and MMBench) and proprietary dataset of 25,326 videos across 14 disease areas; and (iii) four findings relevant to long-form video reasoning: the role of multimodality, attention mechanism trade-offs, temporal reasoning limits, and challenges of video splitting under GPU constraints. Results show 3-8 times efficiency gains with SDPA attention on commodity GPUs, multimodality improving up to 8/12 task domains (especially length-dependent tasks), and clear bottlenecks in temporal alignment and keyframe detection across open- and closed-source VLMs. Rather than proposing a new "A+B" model, this paper characterizes practical limits, trade-offs, and failure patterns of current VLMs under realistic deployment constraints, and provide actionable guidance for both researchers and practitioners designing scalable multimodal systems for long-form video understanding in industrial domains.

Motivation: To enhance the robustness of image learning models, particularly under rotation transformations, by leveraging structured split and leaf coefficients in CMTs.

Method: Introduces three inductive biases (convolutional smoothing, tilt dominance constraint, importance-based pruning) and evaluates deployment-time orientation search for selecting optimal rotations.

Result: Orientation search improves robustness under severe rotations but can degrade performance near canonical orientations. Trends in MNIST digit recognition highlight the potential and limitations of confidence-based orientation selection.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the promise of geometry-aware inductive biases and orientation search in CMTs for rotation robustness but notes limitations in confidence-based approaches.

Abstract: We study rotation-robust learning for image inputs using Convolutional Model Trees (CMTs) [1], whose split and leaf coefficients can be structured on the image grid and transformed geometrically at deployment time. In a controlled MNIST setting with a rotation-invariant regression target, we introduce three geometry-aware inductive biases for split directions -- convolutional smoothing, a tilt dominance constraint, and importance-based pruning -- and quantify their impact on robustness under in-plane rotations. We further evaluate a deployment-time orientation search that selects a discrete rotation maximizing a forest-level confidence proxy without updating model parameters. Orientation search improves robustness under severe rotations but can be harmful near the canonical orientation when confidence is misaligned with correctness. Finally, we observe consistent trends on MNIST digit recognition implemented as one-vs-rest regression, highlighting both the promise and limitations of confidence-based orientation selection for model-tree ensembles.

### [47] [Prototypicality Bias Reveals Blindspots in Multimodal Evaluation Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04946)
*Subhadeep Roy,Gagan Bhatia,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProtoBias, a benchmark to evaluate prototypicality bias in automatic metrics for text-to-image models, and proposes ProtoScore, a robust metric to address these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether automatic metrics prioritize semantic correctness or visual/social prototypicality due to biased data distributions, and to improve evaluation robustness.

Method: Developed ProtoBias, a controlled benchmark pairing semantically correct non-prototypical images with subtly incorrect prototypical ones, and evaluated metrics like CLIPScore, PickScore, and LLM-as-Judge systems. Also proposed ProtoScore, a faster, robust metric.

Result: Existing metrics frequently misranked pairs, favoring prototypes over semantics, while humans prioritized semantic correctness. ProtoScore significantly reduced failure rates and outperformed other metrics.

Conclusion: Prototypicality bias is a significant issue in multimodal evaluation, and ProtoScore offers a more reliable and efficient solution compared to current metrics.

Abstract: Automatic metrics are now central to evaluating text-to-image models, often substituting for human judgment in benchmarking and large-scale filtering. However, it remains unclear whether these metrics truly prioritize semantic correctness or instead favor visually and socially prototypical images learned from biased data distributions. We identify and study \emph{prototypicality bias} as a systematic failure mode in multimodal evaluation. We introduce a controlled contrastive benchmark \textsc{\textbf{ProtoBias}} (\textit{\textbf{Proto}typical \textbf{Bias}}), spanning Animals, Objects, and Demography images, where semantically correct but non-prototypical images are paired with subtly incorrect yet prototypical adversarial counterparts. This setup enables a directional evaluation of whether metrics follow textual semantics or default to prototypes. Our results show that widely used metrics, including CLIPScore, PickScore, and VQA-based scores, frequently misrank these pairs, while even LLM-as-Judge systems exhibit uneven robustness in socially grounded cases. Human evaluations consistently favour semantic correctness with larger decision margins. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{\textsc{ProtoScore}}, a robust 7B-parameter metric that substantially reduces failure rates and suppresses misranking, while running at orders of magnitude faster than the inference time of GPT-5, approaching the robustness of much larger closed-source judges.

*Juyuan Kang,Hao Zhu,Yan Zhu,Wei Zhang,Jianing Chen,Tianxiang Xiao,Yike Ma,Hao Jiang,Feng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TEA, a temporal adaptive method for satellite image time-series (SITS) segmentation, improving generalization across varying temporal lengths by leveraging teacher-student knowledge transfer and full-sequence reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SITS segmentation methods perform poorly with varying temporal lengths; the study aims to enhance model resilience in such scenarios.

Method: Introduces TEA, using a teacher model to guide a student model with adaptive temporal inputs via embedding, prototypes, and soft labels, plus full-sequence reconstruction as an auxiliary task.

Result: TEA achieves significant improvements across different temporal lengths on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses generalization issues in SITS segmentation for varying temporal lengths, with reproducible results.

Abstract: Crop mapping based on satellite images time-series (SITS) holds substantial economic value in agricultural production settings, in which parcel segmentation is an essential step. Existing approaches have achieved notable advancements in SITS segmentation with predetermined sequence lengths. However, we found that these approaches overlooked the generalization capability of models across scenarios with varying temporal length, leading to markedly poor segmentation results in such cases. To address this issue, we propose TEA, a TEmporal Adaptive SITS semantic segmentation method to enhance the model's resilience under varying sequence lengths. We introduce a teacher model that encapsulates the global sequence knowledge to guide a student model with adaptive temporal input lengths. Specifically, teacher shapes the student's feature space via intermediate embedding, prototypes and soft label perspectives to realize knowledge transfer, while dynamically aggregating student model to mitigate knowledge forgetting. Finally, we introduce full-sequence reconstruction as an auxiliary task to further enhance the quality of representations across inputs of varying temporal lengths. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method brings remarkable improvements across inputs of different temporal lengths on common benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available.

*Maximilian Pittner,Joel Janai,Mario Faigle,Alexandru Paul Condurache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseLaneSTP integrates lane geometry and temporal data into a sparse transformer, addressing challenges in 3D lane detection with a new attention mechanism and dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D lane detection by leveraging lane-specific priors and temporal information, overcoming limitations of existing methods like poor feature alignment and ignored historical data.

Method: Introduces SparseLaneSTP with lane-specific spatio-temporal attention, continuous sparse lane representation, and temporal regularization. Also presents a new auto-labeled 3D lane dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and the new dataset, validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: SparseLaneSTP successfully combines lane structure and temporal insights, setting new standards in 3D lane detection.

Abstract: 3D lane detection has emerged as a critical challenge in autonomous driving, encompassing identification and localization of lane markings and the 3D road surface. Conventional 3D methods detect lanes from dense birds-eye-viewed (BEV) features, though erroneous transformations often result in a poor feature representation misaligned with the true 3D road surface. While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors. Furthermore, existing methods fail to utilize historic lane observations, which yield the potential to resolve ambiguities in situations of poor visibility. To address these challenges, we present SparseLaneSTP, a novel method that integrates both geometric properties of the lane structure and temporal information into a sparse lane transformer. It introduces a new lane-specific spatio-temporal attention mechanism, a continuous lane representation tailored for sparse architectures as well as temporal regularization. Identifying weaknesses of existing 3D lane datasets, we also introduce a precise and consistent 3D lane dataset using a simple yet effective auto-labeling strategy. Our experimental section proves the benefits of our contributions and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all detection and error metrics on existing 3D lane detection benchmarks as well as on our novel dataset.

*Minseong Kweon,Jinsun Park*

TL;DR: OceanSplat introduces a 3D Gaussian Splatting method to address underwater scene reconstruction challenges by enforcing view consistency, using synthetic depth priors, and depth-aware opacity adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater scenes suffer from optical degradation and multi-view inconsistencies, which degrade the accuracy of 3D geometry representation. OceanSplat aims to address these issues.

Method: The method enforces trinocular view consistency through inverse warping of translated camera views, derives synthetic epipolar depth priors for regularization, and uses depth-aware alpha adjustments to modulate Gaussian opacity.

Result: OceanSplat outperforms existing methods in reconstructing and restoring underwater scenes by reducing floating artifacts and disentangling 3D Gaussians from scattering media.

Conclusion: OceanSplat effectively represents 3D geometry in underwater environments by combining view consistency, depth regularization, and adaptive opacity, demonstrating superior performance in experiments.

Abstract: We introduce OceanSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting-based approach for accurately representing 3D geometry in underwater scenes. To overcome multi-view inconsistencies caused by underwater optical degradation, our method enforces trinocular view consistency by rendering horizontally and vertically translated camera views relative to each input view and aligning them via inverse warping. Furthermore, these translated camera views are used to derive a synthetic epipolar depth prior through triangulation, which serves as a self-supervised depth regularizer. These geometric constraints facilitate the spatial optimization of 3D Gaussians and preserve scene structure in underwater environments. We also propose a depth-aware alpha adjustment that modulates the opacity of 3D Gaussians during early training based on their $z$-component and viewing direction, deterring the formation of medium-induced primitives. With our contributions, 3D Gaussians are disentangled from the scattering medium, enabling robust representation of object geometry and significantly reducing floating artifacts in reconstructed underwater scenes. Experiments on real-world underwater and simulated scenes demonstrate that OceanSplat substantially outperforms existing methods for both scene reconstruction and restoration in scattering media.

*Jens Bayer,Stefan Becker,David Münch,Michael Arens,Jürgen Beyerer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Higher-order adversarial attacks generalize better than lower-order ones and adversarial training alone isn't enough to defend against them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of higher-order adversarial attacks on object detectors and the effectiveness of adversarial training.

Method: Successively training attack patterns and hardening YOLOv10 detectors with adversarial training, using adversarial patches.

Result: Higher-order adversarial patches generalize better; adversarial training alone is insufficient.

Conclusion: Higher-order adversarial attacks pose a significant challenge, requiring better defense strategies beyond adversarial training.

Abstract: Higher-order adversarial attacks can directly be considered the result of a cat-and-mouse game -- an elaborate action involving constant pursuit, near captures, and repeated escapes. This idiom describes the enduring circular training of adversarial attack patterns and adversarial training the best. The following work investigates the impact of higher-order adversarial attacks on object detectors by successively training attack patterns and hardening object detectors with adversarial training. The YOLOv10 object detector is chosen as a representative, and adversarial patches are used in an evasion attack manner. Our results indicate that higher-order adversarial patches are not only affecting the object detector directly trained on but rather provide a stronger generalization capacity compared to lower-order adversarial patches. Moreover, the results highlight that solely adversarial training is not sufficient to harden an object detector efficiently against this kind of adversarial attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify surface representation and deformation tasks in computer vision and graphics by reducing optimization complexity and improving efficiency.

Method: PolyFit fits jet functions locally on surface patches, allowing supervised learning from analytic functions and real data. It updates jet coefficients for deformation.

Result: PolyFit outperforms physics-based solvers and neural simulators in accuracy and speed for Shape-from-template and garment draping applications.

Conclusion: PolyFit provides an efficient, generalizable solution for surface deformation tasks, offering significant speed and accuracy improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a patch-based representation of surfaces, PolyFit, which is obtained by fitting jet functions locally on surface patches. Such a representation can be learned efficiently in a supervised fashion from both analytic functions and real data. Once learned, it can be generalized to various types of surfaces. Using PolyFit, the surfaces can be efficiently deformed by updating a compact set of jet coefficients rather than optimizing per-vertex degrees of freedom for many downstream tasks in computer vision and graphics. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed methodologies with two applications: 1) Shape-from-template (SfT): where the goal is to deform the input 3D template of an object as seen in image/video. Using PolyFit, we adopt test-time optimization that delivers competitive accuracy while being markedly faster than offline physics-based solvers, and outperforms recent physics-guided neural simulators in accuracy at modest additional runtime. 2) Garment draping. We train a self-supervised, mesh- and garment-agnostic model that generalizes across resolutions and garment types, delivering up to an order-of-magnitude faster inference than strong baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Video to Video Clip Generation framework combining ALMs and VLMs to automate and enhance video summarization in pharmaceuticals, offering efficiency, cost savings, and improved quality over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of diverse data modalities in pharmaceuticals is inconsistent and inefficient, especially for lengthy videos like clinical trials and seminars. The paper aims to automate and improve this process.

Method: The framework uses a Cut & Merge algorithm for smooth transitions, personalized role-based outputs, and an efficient pipeline integrating ALMs and VLMs.

Result: Tests on benchmark and proprietary datasets show 3-4x speedup, 4x cost reduction, and better clip coherence (0.348) and informativeness (0.721) scores compared to state-of-the-art VLMs.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant efficiency and quality improvements, showcasing potential for transparent, compliant video summarization in life sciences.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are poised to revolutionize the digital transformation of pharmacyceutical industry by enabling intelligent, scalable, and automated multi-modality content processing. Traditional manual annotation of heterogeneous data modalities (text, images, video, audio, and web links), is prone to inconsistencies, quality degradation, and inefficiencies in content utilization. The sheer volume of long video and audio data further exacerbates these challenges, (e.g. long clinical trial interviews and educational seminars).
  Here, we introduce a domain adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework that integrates Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce highlight clips. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reproducible Cut & Merge algorithm with fade in/out and timestamp normalization, ensuring smooth transitions and audio/visual alignment; (ii) a personalization mechanism based on role definition and prompt injection for tailored outputs (marketing, training, regulatory); (iii) a cost efficient e2e pipeline strategy balancing ALM/VLM enhanced processing. Evaluations on Video MME benchmark (900) and our proprietary dataset of 16,159 pharmacy videos across 14 disease areas demonstrate 3 to 4 times speedup, 4 times cost reduction, and competitive clip quality. Beyond efficiency gains, we also report our methods improved clip coherence scores (0.348) and informativeness scores (0.721) over state of the art VLM baselines (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro), highlighting the potential of transparent, custom extractive, and compliance supporting video summarization for life sciences.

Motivation: The goal is to develop an accurate, efficient, and adaptive end-to-end autonomous driving system using transformers, reducing downstream computation without sacrificing performance.

Method: Leverages pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) with camera-aware register tokens for compact scene representation. Uses two lightweight transformer decoders: one for trajectory generation and another for scoring based on safety, comfort, and efficiency.

Result: Outperforms or matches strong baselines across NAVSIM-v1, NAVSIM-v2, and HUGSIM benchmarks. Demonstrates efficiency and accuracy with minimal design.

Conclusion: DrivoR proves that a pure-transformer architecture with token compression is effective for adaptive and efficient autonomous driving.

Abstract: We present DrivoR, a simple and efficient transformer-based architecture for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our approach builds on pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) and introduces camera-aware register tokens that compress multi-camera features into a compact scene representation, significantly reducing downstream computation without sacrificing accuracy. These tokens drive two lightweight transformer decoders that generate and then score candidate trajectories. The scoring decoder learns to mimic an oracle and predicts interpretable sub-scores representing aspects such as safety, comfort, and efficiency, enabling behavior-conditioned driving at inference. Despite its minimal design, DrivoR outperforms or matches strong contemporary baselines across NAVSIM-v1, NAVSIM-v2, and the photorealistic closed-loop HUGSIM benchmark. Our results show that a pure-transformer architecture, combined with targeted token compression, is sufficient for accurate, efficient, and adaptive end-to-end driving.

*Filippo Ghilotti,Samuel Brucker,Nahku Saidy,Matteo Matteucci,Mario Bijelic,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised method to generate 3D semantic labels and bounding boxes from unlabeled LiDAR logs using temporal-geometric consistency, improving depth prediction without manual supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlabeled LiDAR data is abundant but underutilized due to the high cost of manual labeling, limiting autonomous-perception research. This work aims to overcome this by leveraging temporal-geometric consistency.

Method: The method uses temporal accumulated LiDAR maps to lift cues from text and 2D vision models into 3D, enforcing joint geometric-semantic consistency with iterative updates and detecting moving objects from inconsistencies.

Result: The method outperforms existing pseudo-labeling techniques, improves depth prediction significantly (51.5% and 22.0% MAE in specific ranges), and generalizes well across three datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bypasses manual labeling costs, enhancing the utility of unlabeled LiDAR data for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Unlabeled LiDAR logs, in autonomous driving applications, are inherently a gold mine of dense 3D geometry hiding in plain sight - yet they are almost useless without human labels, highlighting a dominant cost barrier for autonomous-perception research. In this work we tackle this bottleneck by leveraging temporal-geometric consistency across LiDAR sweeps to lift and fuse cues from text and 2D vision foundation models directly into 3D, without any manual input. We introduce an unsupervised multi-modal pseudo-labeling method relying on strong geometric priors learned from temporally accumulated LiDAR maps, alongside with a novel iterative update rule that enforces joint geometric-semantic consistency, and vice-versa detecting moving objects from inconsistencies. Our method simultaneously produces 3D semantic labels, 3D bounding boxes, and dense LiDAR scans, demonstrating robust generalization across three datasets. We experimentally validate that our method compares favorably to existing semantic segmentation and object detection pseudo-labeling methods, which often require additional manual supervision. We confirm that even a small fraction of our geometrically consistent, densified LiDAR improves depth prediction by 51.5% and 22.0% MAE in the 80-150 and 150-250 meters range, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces projective conditioning and a masked autoencoding pretraining strategy to improve robustness and consistency in feed-forward view synthesis by reframing the task as image-to-image translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use Plücker ray maps, which are sensitive to small camera transformations and undermine geometric consistency. The authors seek a more stable input conditioning for consistent view synthesis.

Method: Proposes projective conditioning for stable 2D input and a masked autoencoding pretraining strategy to leverage uncalibrated data.

Result: The method outperforms ray-conditioned baselines in fidelity and cross-view consistency, achieving state-of-the-art quality on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Projective conditioning and tailored pretraining enhance view synthesis robustness and consistency, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Feed-forward view synthesis models predict a novel view in a single pass with minimal 3D inductive bias. Existing works encode cameras as Plücker ray maps, which tie predictions to the arbitrary world coordinate gauge and make them sensitive to small camera transformations, thereby undermining geometric consistency. In this paper, we ask what inputs best condition a model for robust and consistent view synthesis. We propose projective conditioning, which replaces raw camera parameters with a target-view projective cue that provides a stable 2D input. This reframes the task from a brittle geometric regression problem in ray space to a well-conditioned target-view image-to-image translation problem. Additionally, we introduce a masked autoencoding pretraining strategy tailored to this cue, enabling the use of large-scale uncalibrated data for pretraining. Our method shows improved fidelity and stronger cross-view consistency compared to ray-conditioned baselines on our view-consistency benchmark. It also achieves state-of-the-art quality on standard novel view synthesis benchmarks.

TL;DR: Re-Align bridges understanding and generation in ICGE tasks using structured reasoning-guided alignment and RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified multimodal models struggle to effectively transfer understanding capabilities to image generation tasks.

Method: Introduces In-Context Chain-of-Thought (IC-CoT) for structured reasoning and an RL training scheme with surrogate rewards.

Result: Outperforms comparable methods in ICGE tasks.

Conclusion: Re-Align effectively improves alignment between understanding and generation in ICGE.

Abstract: In-context image generation and editing (ICGE) enables users to specify visual concepts through interleaved image-text prompts, demanding precise understanding and faithful execution of user intent. Although recent unified multimodal models exhibit promising understanding capabilities, these strengths often fail to transfer effectively to image generation. We introduce Re-Align, a unified framework that bridges the gap between understanding and generation through structured reasoning-guided alignment. At its core lies the In-Context Chain-of-Thought (IC-CoT), a structured reasoning paradigm that decouples semantic guidance and reference association, providing clear textual target and mitigating confusion among reference images. Furthermore, Re-Align introduces an effective RL training scheme that leverages a surrogate reward to measure the alignment between structured reasoning text and the generated image, thereby improving the model's overall performance on ICGE tasks. Extensive experiments verify that Re-Align outperforms competitive methods of comparable model scale and resources on both in-context image generation and editing tasks.

Conclusion: VERSE effectively improves Vision-Language Models by targeting visual feature weaknesses, offering a scalable and competitive alternative to SaaS solutions.

Abstract: This work introduces VERSE, a methodology for analyzing and improving Vision-Language Models applied to Visually-rich Document Understanding by exploring their visual embedding space. VERSE enables the visualization of latent representations, supporting the assessment of model feasibility. It also facilitates the identification of problematic regions and guides the generation of synthetic data to enhance performance in those clusters. We validate the methodology by training on the synthetic MERIT Dataset and evaluating on its real-world counterpart, MERIT Secret. Results show that VERSE helps uncover the visual features associated with error-prone clusters, and that retraining with samples containing these features substantially boosts F1 performance without degrading generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that on-premise models such as Donut and Idefics2, when optimized with VERSE, match or even surpass the performance of SaaS solutions like GPT-4 and Pixtral.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video world models lack unified and precise control over camera and multi-object motion in projected 2D planes. VerseCrafter aims to bridge this gap.

Method: VerseCrafter uses a 4D Geometric Control representation (static background point cloud and per-object 3D Gaussian trajectories) and renders these into conditioning signals for a pretrained video diffusion model. An automatic data engine extracts 4D controls from in-the-wild videos for training.

Result: The model generates high-fidelity, view-consistent videos that precisely adhere to specified dynamics.

Conclusion: VerseCrafter effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling explicit and coherent control over camera and object dynamics in a unified 4D world state.

Abstract: Video world models aim to simulate dynamic, real-world environments, yet existing methods struggle to provide unified and precise control over camera and multi-object motion, as videos inherently operate dynamics in the projected 2D image plane. To bridge this gap, we introduce VerseCrafter, a 4D-aware video world model that enables explicit and coherent control over both camera and object dynamics within a unified 4D geometric world state. Our approach is centered on a novel 4D Geometric Control representation, which encodes the world state through a static background point cloud and per-object 3D Gaussian trajectories. This representation captures not only an object's path but also its probabilistic 3D occupancy over time, offering a flexible, category-agnostic alternative to rigid bounding boxes or parametric models. These 4D controls are rendered into conditioning signals for a pretrained video diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-fidelity, view-consistent videos that precisely adhere to the specified dynamics. Unfortunately, another major challenge lies in the scarcity of large-scale training data with explicit 4D annotations. We address this by developing an automatic data engine that extracts the required 4D controls from in-the-wild videos, allowing us to train our model on a massive and diverse dataset.

Method: MuLo-SD combines multi-resolution drafting (low-res drafter with learned up-samplers) and spatially informed parallel verification (high-res model). It uses local rejection and resampling for error correction.

Result: MuLo-SD achieves up to 1.7× speedup over EAGLE-2 and LANTERN, maintaining semantic and perceptual quality on benchmarks (GenEval, DPG-Bench, FID/HPSv2).

Conclusion: MuLo-SD sets a new state-of-the-art in speculative decoding for image synthesis, balancing efficiency and fidelity.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, yet their sequential nature imposes significant latency constraints. Speculative Decoding offers a promising avenue for acceleration, but existing approaches are limited by token-level ambiguity and lack of spatial awareness. In this work, we introduce Multi-Scale Local Speculative Decoding (MuLo-SD), a novel framework that combines multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification to accelerate AR image generation. Our method leverages a low-resolution drafter paired with learned up-samplers to propose candidate image tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Crucially, we incorporate a local rejection and resampling mechanism, enabling efficient correction of draft errors by focusing on spatial neighborhoods rather than raster-scan resampling after the first rejection. We demonstrate that MuLo-SD achieves substantial speedups - up to $\mathbf{1.7\times}$ - outperforming strong speculative decoding baselines such as EAGLE-2 and LANTERN in terms of acceleration, while maintaining comparable semantic alignment and perceptual quality. These results are validated using GenEval, DPG-Bench, and FID/HPSv2 on the MS-COCO 5k validation split. Extensive ablations highlight the impact of up-sampling design, probability pooling, and local rejection and resampling with neighborhood expansion. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in speculative decoding for image synthesis, bridging the gap between efficiency and fidelity.

TL;DR: VLI is a training-free framework addressing object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models by diagnosing risks and dynamically correcting inferences, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination undermines model reliability due to misplaced trust in linguistic priors over visual evidence, with existing mitigations being limited.

Method: VLI uses Attributive Introspection to detect hallucination risks and localize visual anchors, followed by Interpretable Bi-Causal Steering to dynamically correct inferences.

Result: VLI reduces hallucination rates by 12.67% on MMHal-Bench and improves accuracy by 5.8% on POPE.

Conclusion: VLI effectively mitigates object hallucination through a metacognitive self-correction process, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Object hallucination critically undermines the reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models, often stemming from a fundamental failure in cognitive introspection, where models blindly trust linguistic priors over specific visual evidence. Existing mitigations remain limited: contrastive decoding approaches operate superficially without rectifying internal semantic misalignments, while current latent steering methods rely on static vectors that lack instance-specific precision. We introduce Vision-Language Introspection (VLI), a training-free inference framework that simulates a metacognitive self-correction process. VLI first performs Attributive Introspection to diagnose hallucination risks via probabilistic conflict detection and localize the causal visual anchors. It then employs Interpretable Bi-Causal Steering to actively modulate the inference process, dynamically isolating visual evidence from background noise while neutralizing blind confidence through adaptive calibration. VLI achieves state-of-the-art performance on advanced models, reducing object hallucination rates by 12.67% on MMHal-Bench and improving accuracy by 5.8% on POPE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoV prompting enhances VLMs' spatial reasoning in 3D EQA by enabling dynamic view selection and adjustment without training, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are limited by fixed input views, hindering their ability to gather relevant context for complex spatial reasoning in 3D environments.

Method: Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting uses a coarse-to-fine exploration process, employing a View Selection agent and iterative reasoning with camera actions to gather context.

Result: CoV improves LLM-Match by +11.56% on average, with scaling benefits (+2.51% with increased action budget) and strong performance on benchmarks like ScanQA and SQA3D.

Conclusion: CoV is an effective, model-agnostic strategy for enhancing spatial reasoning in 3D EQA through question-aligned view selection and open-view search.

Abstract: Embodied question answering (EQA) in 3D environments often requires collecting context that is distributed across multiple viewpoints and partially occluded. However, most recent vision--language models (VLMs) are constrained to a fixed and finite set of input views, which limits their ability to acquire question-relevant context at inference time and hinders complex spatial reasoning. We propose Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting, a training-free, test-time reasoning framework that transforms a VLM into an active viewpoint reasoner through a coarse-to-fine exploration process. CoV first employs a View Selection agent to filter redundant frames and identify question-aligned anchor views. It then performs fine-grained view adjustment by interleaving iterative reasoning with discrete camera actions, obtaining new observations from the underlying 3D scene representation until sufficient context is gathered or a step budget is reached.
  We evaluate CoV on OpenEQA across four mainstream VLMs and obtain an average +11.56\% improvement in LLM-Match, with a maximum gain of +13.62\% on Qwen3-VL-Flash. CoV further exhibits test-time scaling: increasing the minimum action budget yields an additional +2.51\% average improvement, peaking at +3.73\% on Gemini-2.5-Flash. On ScanQA and SQA3D, CoV delivers strong performance (e.g., 116 CIDEr / 31.9 EM@1 on ScanQA and 51.1 EM@1 on SQA3D). Overall, these results suggest that question-aligned view selection coupled with open-view search is an effective, model-agnostic strategy for improving spatial reasoning in 3D EQA without additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAuto-R1 introduces a selective reasoning framework for video understanding, improving efficiency by reducing response length and maintaining accuracy, with reasoning activated only when necessary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The necessity of Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multimodal video models is unclear, as direct answering often performs comparably or better. This prompts the exploration of a more efficient, selective reasoning approach.

Method: VideoAuto-R1 uses a "Thinking Once, Answering Twice" paradigm: an initial answer is generated, reasoning is performed if needed, and a reviewed answer is output. Both answers are supervised via verifiable rewards.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with ~3.3x shorter responses (e.g., 44 vs. 149 tokens). Reasoning is activated more on reasoning-intensive tasks than perception-oriented ones.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning is beneficial but not always necessary; VideoAuto-R1 optimizes efficiency and accuracy by dynamically activating reasoning based on task demands.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for multimodal large language models on video understanding tasks. However, its necessity and advantages over direct answering remain underexplored. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for RL-trained video models, direct answering often matches or even surpasses CoT performance, despite CoT producing step-by-step analyses at a higher computational cost. Motivated by this, we propose VideoAuto-R1, a video understanding framework that adopts a reason-when-necessary strategy. During training, our approach follows a Thinking Once, Answering Twice paradigm: the model first generates an initial answer, then performs reasoning, and finally outputs a reviewed answer. Both answers are supervised via verifiable rewards. During inference, the model uses the confidence score of the initial answer to determine whether to proceed with reasoning. Across video QA and grounding benchmarks, VideoAuto-R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly improved efficiency, reducing the average response length by ~3.3x, e.g., from 149 to just 44 tokens. Moreover, we observe a low rate of thinking-mode activation on perception-oriented tasks, but a higher rate on reasoning-intensive tasks. This suggests that explicit language-based reasoning is generally beneficial but not always necessary.

TL;DR: AgentCompress reduces costs by compressing language models for easier tasks, saving 68.3% compute costs while maintaining 96.2% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of large language models limit accessibility for academic labs, prompting a solution to reduce expenses without sacrificing performance.

Method: Uses a small neural network to assess task difficulty and routes it to a compressed model variant, making decisions in under a millisecond.

Result: Achieved 68.3% compute cost reduction with minimal performance drop (96.2% success rate) across 500 research workflows in four scientific fields.

Conclusion: AgentCompress offers a cost-effective solution for academic labs, enabling broader access to advanced language model capabilities without significant performance loss.

Abstract: When researchers deploy large language models for autonomous tasks like reviewing literature or generating hypotheses, the computational bills add up quickly. A single research session using a 70-billion parameter model can cost around $127 in cloud fees, putting these tools out of reach for many academic labs. We developed AgentCompress to tackle this problem head-on. The core idea came from a simple observation during our own work: writing a novel hypothesis clearly demands more from the model than reformatting a bibliography. Why should both tasks run at full precision? Our system uses a small neural network to gauge how hard each incoming task will be, based only on its opening words, then routes it to a suitably compressed model variant. The decision happens in under a millisecond. Testing across 500 research workflows in four scientific fields, we cut compute costs by 68.3% while keeping 96.2% of the original success rate. For labs watching their budgets, this could mean the difference between running experiments and sitting on the sidelines

TL;DR: VLMs often favor textual prompts over visual evidence, leading to hallucinations. A study on object-counting shows models increasingly conform to overstated prompts as object counts rise. Ablating specific attention heads reduces hallucinations by 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate prompt-induced hallucinations in VLMs, where models prioritize textual prompts over visual evidence.

Method: Controlled object-counting experiments with overstated prompts, mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, and ablation of identified attention heads.

Result: Ablating specific attention heads reduces prompt-induced hallucinations by at least 40%. Models show varying prompt-copying mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study reveals internal mechanisms behind prompt-induced hallucinations and demonstrates effective mitigation through targeted ablation, highlighting model-specific differences.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly capable, yet often hallucinate by favoring textual prompts over visual evidence. We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Brain Age Prediction (BAP) models are limited by demographically skewed datasets, costly data acquisition, and inefficiencies in current generative methods like latent diffusion models, which are slow and introduce artifacts.

Method: FlowLet leverages flow matching in an invertible 3D wavelet domain to synthesize age-conditioned 3D MRIs, avoiding reconstruction artifacts and computational inefficiencies.

Result: FlowLet generates high-fidelity MRI volumes efficiently and improves BAP model performance, especially for underrepresented age groups, while preserving anatomical structures.

Conclusion: FlowLet is an effective solution for generating diverse and balanced MRI datasets, enhancing BAP fairness and generalizability.

Abstract: Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in studying neurological development, aging, and diseases. One key application is Brain Age Prediction (BAP), which estimates an individual's biological brain age from MRI data. Effective BAP models require large, diverse, and age-balanced datasets, whereas existing 3D MRI datasets are demographically skewed, limiting fairness and generalizability. Acquiring new data is costly and ethically constrained, motivating generative data augmentation. Current generative methods are often based on latent diffusion models, which operate in learned low dimensional latent spaces to address the memory demands of volumetric MRI data. However, these methods are typically slow at inference, may introduce artifacts due to latent compression, and are rarely conditioned on age, thereby affecting the BAP performance. In this work, we propose FlowLet, a conditional generative framework that synthesizes age-conditioned 3D MRIs by leveraging flow matching within an invertible 3D wavelet domain, helping to avoid reconstruction artifacts and reducing computational demands. Experiments show that FlowLet generates high-fidelity volumes with few sampling steps. Training BAP models with data generated by FlowLet improves performance for underrepresented age groups, and region-based analysis confirms preservation of anatomical structures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable computational systems to predict plausible future object motions from passive visual observation, mimicking human anticipation.

Method: Introduces ObjectForesight, a model predicting 6-DoF object poses and trajectories from egocentric videos, using explicit 3D object-level representation. Trained on a dataset of 2M+ clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D trajectories.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in accuracy, geometric consistency, and generalization to unseen objects/scenes.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable framework for learning physically grounded, object-centric dynamics models directly from observation.

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly anticipate how objects might move or change through interaction--imagining a cup being lifted, a knife slicing, or a lid being closed. We aim to endow computational systems with a similar ability to predict plausible future object motions directly from passive visual observation. We introduce ObjectForesight, a 3D object-centric dynamics model that predicts future 6-DoF poses and trajectories of rigid objects from short egocentric video sequences. Unlike conventional world or dynamics models that operate in pixel or latent space, ObjectForesight represents the world explicitly in 3D at the object level, enabling geometrically grounded and temporally coherent predictions that capture object affordances and trajectories. To train such a model at scale, we leverage recent advances in segmentation, mesh reconstruction, and 3D pose estimation to curate a dataset of 2 million plus short clips with pseudo-ground-truth 3D object trajectories. Through extensive experiments, we show that ObjectForesight achieves significant gains in accuracy, geometric consistency, and generalization to unseen objects and scenes, establishing a scalable framework for learning physically grounded, object-centric dynamics models directly from observation. objectforesight.github.io

TL;DR: The paper introduces visual identity prompting to improve data augmentation for robot manipulation training, addressing gaps in multi-view and temporal coherence overlooked by text-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale, diverse manipulation data is hard to collect due to hardware constraints, and existing text-prompted diffusion models lack multi-view and temporal coherence.

Method: Proposes visual identity prompting, using exemplar images to guide scene setup in diffusion models, and builds a pipeline to curate visual identities from large datasets.

Result: Augmented data trained vision-language-action and visuomotor policies show consistent performance gains in simulation and real-robot settings.

Conclusion: Visual identity prompting enhances data augmentation for robot policies, overcoming limitations of text-based methods.

Abstract: The diversity, quantity, and quality of manipulation data are critical for training effective robot policies. However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing REx datasets and methods only support single-target expressions, limiting real-world applications. The paper aims to generalize REx tasks to include multi-target and no-target expressions.

Method: Proposes GREx benchmarks (GRES, GREC, GREG) and constructs the gRefCOCO dataset. Introduces ReLA, a baseline method that divides images into regions with sub-instance clues and models dependencies.

Result: ReLA achieves state-of-the-art results on GRES and GREC tasks.

Conclusion: GREx and gRefCOCO advance REx tasks by addressing multi-target/no-target expressions, with ReLA proving effective for complex relationship modeling.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) and Comprehension (REC) respectively segment and detect the object described by an expression, while Referring Expression Generation (REG) generates an expression for the selected object. Existing datasets and methods commonly support single-target expressions only, i.e., one expression refers to one object, not considering multi-target and no-target expressions. This greatly limits the real applications of REx (RES/REC/REG). This paper introduces three new benchmarks called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), Comprehension (GREC), and Generation (GREG), collectively denoted as GREx, which extend the classic REx to allow expressions to identify an arbitrary number of objects. We construct the first large-scale GREx dataset gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions and their corresponding images with labeled targets. GREx and gRefCOCO are designed to be backward-compatible with REx, facilitating extensive experiments to study the performance gap of the existing REx methods on GREx tasks. One of the challenges of GRES/GREC is complex relationship modeling, for which we propose a baseline ReLA that adaptively divides the image into regions with sub-instance clues and explicitly models the region-region and region-language dependencies. The proposed ReLA achieves the state-of-the-art results on the both GRES and GREC tasks. The proposed gRefCOCO dataset and method are available at https://henghuiding.github.io/GREx.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Pixel-Perfect Depth (PPD) and its video extension (PPVD), leveraging pixel-space diffusion transformers and semantic prompting to achieve high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds with improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometry foundation models struggle with flying pixels and loss of fine details, which hampers their utility in robotics and augmented reality. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The approach involves Pixel-Perfect Depth (PPD), a monocular depth model using pixel-space diffusion transformers (DiT). Key designs include Semantics-Prompted DiT for global semantics and fine detail enhancement, and Cascade DiT for efficiency. PPVD extends this to video with Semantics-Consistent DiT and reference-guided token propagation.

Result: The models outperform all generative monocular and video depth estimation models, delivering cleaner point clouds.

Conclusion: The proposed PPD and PPVD models effectively address flying pixels and fine detail loss, setting new benchmarks in generative depth estimation.

Abstract: Recovering clean and accurate geometry from images is essential for robotics and augmented reality. However, existing geometry foundation models still suffer severely from flying pixels and the loss of fine details. In this paper, we present pixel-perfect visual geometry models that can predict high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds by leveraging generative modeling in the pixel space. We first introduce Pixel-Perfect Depth (PPD), a monocular depth foundation model built upon pixel-space diffusion transformers (DiT). To address the high computational complexity associated with pixel-space diffusion, we propose two key designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted DiT, which incorporates semantic representations from vision foundation models to prompt the diffusion process, preserving global semantics while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT architecture that progressively increases the number of image tokens, improving both efficiency and accuracy. To further extend PPD to video (PPVD), we introduce a new Semantics-Consistent DiT, which extracts temporally consistent semantics from a multi-view geometry foundation model. We then perform reference-guided token propagation within the DiT to maintain temporal coherence with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our models achieve the best performance among all generative monocular and video depth estimation models and produce significantly cleaner point clouds than all other models.

TL;DR: QNeRF is a hybrid quantum-classical model for novel-view synthesis, leveraging quantum circuits for compact and efficient representation, outperforming classical NeRF with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical NeRF requires large models and intensive training for 3D scene rendering. QNeRF aims to improve compactness and efficiency using quantum principles.

Method: QNeRF uses parameterized quantum circuits for spatial and view-dependent encoding via superposition and entanglement, offering two variants: Full QNeRF and Dual-Branch QNeRF.

Result: QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF with less than half the parameters, showing potential for quantum machine learning in computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: QNeRF demonstrates quantum machine learning's viability as a competitive alternative for compact 3D representation learning from 2D inputs.

Abstract: Recently, Quantum Visual Fields (QVFs) have shown promising improvements in model compactness and convergence speed for learning the provided 2D or 3D signals. Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation from 2D images to render 3D scenes, albeit at the cost of larger models and intensive training. In this work, we extend the approach of QVFs by introducing QNeRF, the first hybrid quantum-classical model designed for novel-view synthesis from 2D images. QNeRF leverages parameterised quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition and entanglement, resulting in more compact models compared to the classical counterpart. We present two architectural variants. Full QNeRF maximally exploits all quantum amplitudes to enhance representational capabilities. In contrast, Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces a task-informed inductive bias by branching spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations, drastically reducing the complexity of this operation and ensuring scalability and potential hardware compatibility. Our experiments demonstrate that -- when trained on images of moderate resolution -- QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines while using less than half the number of parameters. These results suggest that quantum machine learning can serve as a competitive alternative for continuous signal representation in mid-level tasks in computer vision, such as 3D representation learning from 2D observations.

TL;DR: Mesh4D is a feed-forward model for monocular 4D mesh reconstruction, capturing dynamic object shapes and motions efficiently using a latent space and skeletal priors, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to reconstruct accurate 3D shapes and motions from monocular videos without skeletal data at inference, addressing challenges in dynamic object modeling.

Method: Mesh4D uses an autoencoder with skeletal guidance during training, spatio-temporal attention for stability, and a latent diffusion model to predict animations from video input.

Result: Mesh4D outperforms existing methods in 3D shape and deformation recovery benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mesh4D efficiently reconstructs 4D meshes from monocular videos, leveraging latent space and skeletal priors for superior performance.

Abstract: We propose Mesh4D, a feed-forward model for monocular 4D mesh reconstruction. Given a monocular video of a dynamic object, our model reconstructs the object's complete 3D shape and motion, represented as a deformation field. Our key contribution is a compact latent space that encodes the entire animation sequence in a single pass. This latent space is learned by an autoencoder that, during training, is guided by the skeletal structure of the training objects, providing strong priors on plausible deformations. Crucially, skeletal information is not required at inference time. The encoder employs spatio-temporal attention, yielding a more stable representation of the object's overall deformation. Building on this representation, we train a latent diffusion model that, conditioned on the input video and the mesh reconstructed from the first frame, predicts the full animation in one shot. We evaluate Mesh4D on reconstruction and novel view synthesis benchmarks, outperforming prior methods in recovering accurate 3D shape and deformation.

Abstract: Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remains a challenging task: existing metrics often collapse heterogeneous behaviors into single scores and provide little insight into whether errors arise from retrieval,reasoning, or grounding. In this paper, we introduce RAGVUE, a diagnostic and explainable framework for automated, reference-free evaluation of RAG pipelines. RAGVUE decomposes RAG behavior into retrieval quality, answer relevance and completeness, strict claim-level faithfulness, and judge calibration. Each metric includes a structured explanation, making the evaluation process transparent. Our framework supports both manual metric selection and fully automated agentic evaluation. It also provides a Python API, CLI, and a local Streamlit interface for interactive usage. In comparative experiments, RAGVUE surfaces fine-grained failures that existing tools such as RAGAS often overlook. We showcase the full RAGVUE workflow and illustrate how it can be integrated into research pipelines and practical RAG development. The source code and detailed instructions on usage are publicly available on GitHub

*Xuri Tang,Daohuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A fully unsupervised method creates Chinese verb collostructions as directed acyclic graphs, improving LLMs' interpretability and performance in error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide explicit, interpretable rules for Chinese verb usage where explainability is crucial, complementing LLMs.

Method: Defines verb collostructions as projective, rooted, ordered, directed acyclic graphs; uses clustering algorithms on corpus-derived sentences to generate collostructions.

Result: Generated collostructions show functional independence and graded typicality; improve verb grammatical error correction over LLMs.

Conclusion: The unsupervised approach effectively constructs interpretable verb collostructions, enhancing LLM applications requiring explainability.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully unsupervised approach to the construction of verb collostruction database for Chinese language, aimed at complementing LLMs by providing explicit and interpretable rules for application scenarios where explanation and interpretability are indispensable. The paper formally defines a verb collostruction as a projective, rooted, ordered, and directed acyclic graph and employs a series of clustering algorithms to generate collostructions for a given verb from a list of sentences retrieved from large-scale corpus. Statistical analysis demonstrates that the generated collostructions possess the design features of functional independence and graded typicality. Evaluation with verb grammatical error correction shows that the error correction algorithm based on maximum matching with collostructions achieves better performance than LLMs.

*Virginia Negri,Víctor Martínez Gómez,Sergio A. Balanya,Subburam Rajaram*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using LLMs generates synthetic e-commerce product data with controlled modifications, achieving high-quality results comparable to real data and improving low-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets for e-commerce product information extraction is challenging, prompting the need for synthetic data generation.

Method: The approach uses LLMs with attribute-aware prompts and three strategies: attribute-preserving modification, controlled negative example generation, and systematic attribute removal.

Result: Synthetic data performs nearly as well as real data (60.5% vs. 60.8% accuracy) and hybrid configurations achieve 68.8% accuracy. Human evaluation confirms high naturalness and validity.

Conclusion: The framework effectively augments e-commerce datasets, especially benefiting low-resource scenarios with synthetic data.

Abstract: Product information extraction is crucial for e-commerce services, but obtaining high-quality labeled datasets remains challenging. We present a systematic approach for generating synthetic e-commerce product data using Large Language Models (LLMs), introducing a controlled modification framework with three strategies: attribute-preserving modification, controlled negative example generation, and systematic attribute removal. Using a state-of-the-art LLM with attribute-aware prompts, we enforce store constraints while maintaining product coherence. Human evaluation of 2000 synthetic products demonstrates high effectiveness, with 99.6% rated as natural, 96.5% containing valid attribute values, and over 90% showing consistent attribute usage. On the public MAVE dataset, our synthetic data achieves 60.5% accuracy, performing on par with real training data (60.8%) and significantly improving upon the 13.4% zero-shot baseline. Hybrid configurations combining synthetic and real data further improve performance, reaching 68.8% accuracy. Our framework provides a practical solution for augmenting e-commerce datasets, particularly valuable for low-resource scenarios.

### [80] [Collective Narrative Grounding: Community-Coordinated Data Contributions to Improve Local AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04201)
*Zihan Gao,Mohsin Y. K. Yousufi,Jacob Thebault-Spieker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses knowledge gaps in LLM question-answering systems for community-specific queries by introducing Collective Narrative Grounding, a participatory protocol integrating community stories into AI systems. It identifies 76.7% errors in local QA benchmarks and shows LLMs perform poorly (21% accuracy) without local context, suggesting narrative integration can bridge gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail on community-specific queries, marginalizing local voices and causing epistemic injustice. This work aims to ground AI systems in community narratives to address these gaps.

Method: Developed Collective Narrative Grounding, a protocol involving participatory workshops (N=24) to structure community stories for AI integration. Designed elicitation methods and schema for narrative richness while enabling extraction and validation. Audited a local QA benchmark (14,782 pairs) and tested LLM performance on participatory QA sets.

Result: Identified 76.7% errors due to factual gaps, cultural misunderstandings, etc., in local QA benchmarks. LLMs answered <21% correctly without added context, with missing facts often found in collected narratives.

Conclusion: The protocol and participatory evaluation provide a foundation for community-grounded AI, addressing key design tensions (e.g., governance, privacy) and improving local QA accuracy by integrating narratives.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) question-answering systems often fail on community-specific queries, creating "knowledge blind spots" that marginalize local voices and reinforce epistemic injustice. We present Collective Narrative Grounding, a participatory protocol that transforms community stories into structured narrative units and integrates them into AI systems under community governance. Learning from three participatory mapping workshops with N=24 community members, we designed elicitation methods and a schema that retain narrative richness while enabling entity, time, and place extraction, validation, and provenance control. To scope the problem, we audit a county-level benchmark of 14,782 local information QA pairs, where factual gaps, cultural misunderstandings, geographic confusions, and temporal misalignments account for 76.7% of errors. On a participatory QA set derived from our workshops, a state-of-the-art LLM answered fewer than 21% of questions correctly without added context, underscoring the need for local grounding. The missing facts often appear in the collected narratives, suggesting a direct path to closing the dominant error modes for narrative items. Beyond the protocol and pilot, we articulate key design tensions, such as representation and power, governance and control, and privacy and consent, providing concrete requirements for retrieval-first, provenance-visible, locally governed QA systems. Together, our taxonomy, protocol, and participatory evaluation offer a rigorous foundation for building community-grounded AI that better answers local questions.

### [81] [TeleTables: A Benchmark for Large Language Models in Telecom Table Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04202)
*Anas Ezzakri,Nicola Piovesan,Mohamed Sana,Antonio De Domenico,Fadhel Ayed,Haozhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeleTables is a benchmark evaluating LLMs' knowledge and interpretation of tables in telecom standards, revealing their limitations and the need for domain-specialized fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with telecom standards like 3GPP due to poor performance on densely tabulated information.

Method: TeleTables was created using a multi-stage pipeline extracting tables from 3GPP standards and generating validated questions.

Result: Smaller models (<10B parameters) perform poorly, while larger models show better reasoning on table interpretation.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized fine-tuning is essential for LLMs to reliably interpret telecom standards.

Abstract: Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in the telecom industry to support engineering tasks, accelerate troubleshooting, and assist in interpreting complex technical documents. However, recent studies show that LLMs perform poorly on telecom standards, particularly 3GPP specifications. We argue that a key reason is that these standards densely include tables to present essential information, yet the LLM knowledge and interpretation ability of such tables remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce TeleTables, a benchmark designed to evaluate both the implicit knowledge LLMs have about tables in technical specifications and their explicit ability to interpret them. TeleTables is built through a novel multi-stage data generation pipeline that extracts tables from 3GPP standards and uses multimodal and reasoning-oriented LLMs to generate and validate questions. The resulting dataset, which is publicly available, comprises 500 human-verified question-answer pairs, each associated with the corresponding table in multiple formats. Our evaluation shows that, smaller models (under 10B parameters) struggle both to recall 3GPP knowledge and to interpret tables, indicating the limited exposure to telecom standards in their pretraining and the insufficient inductive biases for navigating complex technical material. Larger models, on the other hand, show stronger reasoning on table interpretation. Overall, TeleTables highlights the need for domain-specialized fine-tuning to reliably interpret and reason over telecom standards.

*Xueqing Wu,Zihan Xue,Da Yin,Shuyan Zhou,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng,Yeming Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FronTalk is a benchmark for conversational front-end code generation with multi-modal feedback, addressing gaps in interpreting visual instructions and model forgetting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the role of visual artifacts in multi-turn code generation for front-end development, which remains largely unexplored.

Method: Curated 100 multi-turn dialogues with textual and visual instructions, evaluated using a web agent-based framework to measure functional correctness and user experience. Proposed AceCoder to mitigate forgetting.

Result: Identified key challenges: model forgetting and visual feedback interpretation. AceCoder reduced forgetting to nearly zero and improved performance by up to 9.3%.

Conclusion: FronTalk provides a foundation for future research in multi-modal, multi-turn code generation, with tools and data publicly available.

Abstract: We present FronTalk, a benchmark for front-end code generation that pioneers the study of a unique interaction dynamic: conversational code generation with multi-modal feedback. In front-end development, visual artifacts such as sketches, mockups and annotated creenshots are essential for conveying design intent, yet their role in multi-turn code generation remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the front-end development task and curate FronTalk, a collection of 100 multi-turn dialogues derived from real-world websites across diverse domains such as news, finance, and art. Each turn features both a textual instruction and an equivalent visual instruction, each representing the same user intent. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, we propose a novel agent-based evaluation framework leveraging a web agent to simulate users and explore the website, and thus measuring both functional correctness and user experience. Evaluation of 20 models reveals two key challenges that are under-explored systematically in the literature: (1) a significant forgetting issue where models overwrite previously implemented features, resulting in task failures, and (2) a persistent challenge in interpreting visual feedback, especially for open-source vision-language models (VLMs). We propose a strong baseline to tackle the forgetting issue with AceCoder, a method that critiques the implementation of every past instruction using an autonomous web agent. This approach significantly reduces forgetting to nearly zero and improves the performance by up to 9.3% (56.0% to 65.3%). Overall, we aim to provide a solid foundation for future research in front-end development and the general interaction dynamics of multi-turn, multi-modal code generation.

*Xinhao Sun,Maoliang Li,Zihao Zheng,Jiayu Chen,Hezhao Xu,Yun Liang,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic remasking strategy for diffusion language models (DLMs) that adapts thresholds per token based on temporal variance and spatial deviance, improving efficiency without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-threshold remasking overlooks token-specific dynamics, leading to redundant iterations and limited parallelism.

Method: Proposes a dynamic remasking approach using Temporal Variance and Spatial Deviance signals to adjust confidence thresholds per token per step.

Result: Achieves up to 8.9x speedup across datasets while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: Dynamic remasking enhances DLM efficiency by leveraging token-specific convergence and correlation signals.

Abstract: Unlike autoregressive language models, diffusion language models (DLMs) generate text by iteratively denoising all token positions in parallel. At each timestep, the remasking strategy of a DLM selects low- priority tokens to defer their decoding, thereby improving both efficiency and output quality. However, mainstream remasking strategies rely on a single global confidence threshold, overlooking the temporal and spatial dynamics of individual tokens. Motivated by the redundant iterations and constrained parallelism introduced by fixed-threshold remasking, we propose a novel remasking approach that dynamically detects Temporal Variance and Spa- tial Deviance of each token, which reflect its convergence status and inter-token correlations. Using these signals, our method adaptively adjusts the confidence threshold for every token at every step. Empirical re- sults show that our approach significantly improves the operational efficiency of DLMs across mainstream datasets, achieving speedups of up to 8.9 times while faithfully preserving generation quality.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI system combining fine-tuned language models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve response time and accuracy in university admissions inquiries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: University admissions offices struggle with high inquiry volumes, impacting prospective students' perceptions. Ensuring efficient and accurate responses is crucial.

Method: A hybrid approach fine-tunes a language model on admissions-specific data, integrating RAG for retrieving up-to-date information while embedding domain understanding. Response generation logic is optimized for quality and speed.

Result: The system enhances the model's ability to generate accurate, domain-relevant responses by leveraging RAG and fine-tuning, balancing speed and quality.

Conclusion: The proposed AI system effectively addresses admissions offices' challenges by improving response accuracy and efficiency through tailored fine-tuning and RAG integration.

Abstract: University admissions offices face the significant challenge of managing high volumes of inquiries efficiently while maintaining response quality, which critically impacts prospective students' perceptions. This paper addresses the issues of response time and information accuracy by proposing an AI system integrating a fine-tuned language model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG effectively retrieves relevant information from large datasets, its performance in narrow, complex domains like university admissions can be limited without adaptation, potentially leading to contextually inadequate responses due to the intricate rules and specific details involved. To overcome this, we fine-tuned the model on a curated dataset specific to admissions processes, enhancing its ability to interpret RAG-provided data accurately and generate domain-relevant outputs. This hybrid approach leverages RAG's ability to access up-to-date information and fine-tuning's capacity to embed nuanced domain understanding. We further explored optimization strategies for the response generation logic, experimenting with settings to balance response quality and speed, aiming for consistently high-quality outputs that meet the specific requirements of admissions communications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs organize ideology differently from humans; a linear probe measures and corrects this misalignment without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' ideological representations often misalign with human views, needing a simple, efficient correction method.

Method: Use a lightweight linear probe to quantify misalignment and adjust output probabilities directly.

Result: The method effectively aligns LLMs with user opinions while preserving original reasoning.

Conclusion: This low-cost solution offers practical alignment without retraining, maintaining model performance.

Abstract: LLMs internally organize political ideology along low-dimensional structures that are partially, but not fully aligned with human ideological space. This misalignment is systematic, model specific, and measurable. We introduce a lightweight linear probe that both quantifies the misalignment and minimally corrects the output layer. This paper introduces a simple and efficient method for aligning models with specific user opinions. Instead of retraining the model, we calculated a bias score from its internal features and directly adjusted the final output probabilities. This solution is practical and low-cost and preserves the original reasoning power of the model.

*Xiang Cheng,Wen Wang,Anindya Ghose*

TL;DR: LEXMA is a reinforcement-learning-based framework using LLMs to generate accurate, audience-tailored explanations for AI decisions without needing large human-annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of coherent, audience-appropriate explanations in AI decision-making, especially in high-stakes scenarios like mortgage approvals.

Method: LEXMA employs reflection-augmented supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune LLMs for decision correctness and stylistic requirements.

Result: LEXMA outperforms baselines in predictive performance and generates clearer, more actionable explanations for both experts and consumers.

Conclusion: LEXMA offers a scalable, cost-efficient solution for improving AI transparency through tailored natural-language explanations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models increasingly drive high-stakes consumer interactions, yet their decision logic often remains opaque. Prevailing explainable AI techniques rely on post hoc numerical feature attributions, which fail to provide coherent narratives behind model decisions. Large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to generate natural-language explanations, but three design challenges remain unresolved: explanations must be both decision-correct and faithful to the factors that drive the prediction; they should be able to serve multiple audiences without shifting the underlying decision rule; and they should be trained in a label-efficient way that does not depend on large corpora of human-scored explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce LEXMA (LLM-based EXplanations for Multi-Audience decisions), a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning framework that produces narrative-driven, audience-appropriate explanations. LEXMA combines reflection-augmented supervised fine-tuning with two stages of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Specifically, it fine-tunes two separate parameter sets to improve decision correctness and satisfy stylistic requirements for different audiences, using reward signals that do not rely on human-annotated explanations. We instantiate LEXMA in the context of mortgage approval decisions. Results demonstrate that LEXMA yields significant improvements in predictive performance compared with other LLM baselines. Moreover, human evaluations show that expert-facing explanations generated by our approach are more risk-focused, and consumer-facing explanations are clearer, more actionable, and more polite. Our study contributes a cost-efficient, systematic LLM fine-tuning approach to enhance explanation quality for business decisions, offering strong potential for scalable deployment of transparent AI systems.

TL;DR: A RAG system was developed for recommending medical research collaborators using locally deployed LLMs and PubMedBERT, proving feasibility under strict privacy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are valuable in medical settings, but strict privacy rules require local data processing.

Method: Developed a RAG system using PubMedBERT for embeddings and LLaMA3 for generative synthesis, all deployed locally.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility of integrating specialized encoders with lightweight LLMs for biomedical knowledge discovery.

Conclusion: The system supports medical research collaborator recommendations while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized as valuable tools across the medical environment, supporting clinical, research, and administrative workflows. However, strict privacy and network security regulations in hospital settings require that sensitive data be processed within fully local infrastructures. Within this context, we developed and evaluated a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to recommend research collaborators based on PubMed publications authored by members of a medical institution. The system utilizes PubMedBERT for domain-specific embedding generation and a locally deployed LLaMA3 model for generative synthesis. This study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of integrating domain-specialized encoders with lightweight LLMs to support biomedical knowledge discovery under local deployment constraints.

Conclusion: Qwerty AI is a practical solution for Russian media workflows, developed during a hackathon to meet real industry needs.

Abstract: We present Qwerty AI, an end-to-end system for automated age-rating and content-safety assessment of Russian-language screenplays according to Federal Law No. 436-FZ. The system processes full-length scripts (up to 700 pages in under 2 minutes), segments them into narrative units, detects content violations across five categories (violence, sexual content, profanity, substances, frightening elements), and assigns age ratings (0+, 6+, 12+, 16+, 18+) with explainable justifications. Our implementation leverages a fine-tuned Phi-3-mini model with 4-bit quantization, achieving 80% rating accuracy and 80-95% segmentation precision (format-dependent).

TL;DR: BiForget is an automated framework for synthesizing high-quality forget sets in machine unlearning, improving relevance, diversity, and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for machine unlearning inadequately represent the true forgetting scope of LLMs, necessitating a more robust evaluation framework.

Method: BiForget leverages the target model itself to generate data matching its internal knowledge distribution via seed-guided and adversarial prompting, formalizing domain-level and instance-level unlearning.

Result: In the Harry Potter domain, BiForget improves relevance by ~20, diversity by ~0.05, and reduces data size by half compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BiForget provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating LLM unlearning, ensuring robust forgetting and better utility preservation.

Abstract: Although machine unlearning is essential for removing private, harmful, or copyrighted content from LLMs, current benchmarks often fail to faithfully represent the true "forgetting scope" learned by the model. We formalize two distinct unlearning granularities, domain-level and instance-level, and propose BiForget, an automated framework for synthesizing high-quality forget sets. Unlike prior work relying on external generators, BiForget exploits the target model per se to elicit data that matches its internal knowledge distribution through seed-guided and adversarial prompting. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks show that it achieves a superior balance of relevance, diversity, and efficiency. Quantitatively, in the Harry Potter domain, it improves relevance by ${\sim}20$ and diversity by ${\sim}$0.05 while halving the total data size compared to SOTAs. Ultimately, it facilitates more robust forgetting and better utility preservation, providing a more rigorous foundation for evaluating LLM unlearning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RIGOURATE is a framework that retrieves evidence from papers and scores claims for overstatement to promote scientific rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of overstatement in scientific claims by improving evidential support and transparency.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage multimodal approach, fine-tuned reranker for evidence retrieval, and a model to predict and justify overstatement scores.

Result: RIGOURATE outperforms baselines in evidence retrieval and overstatement detection, validated by human evaluation.

Conclusion: The study operationalizes evidential proportionality, enhancing clarity and transparency in scientific communication.

Abstract: Scientific rigour tends to be sidelined in favour of bold statements, leading authors to overstate claims beyond what their results support. We present RIGOURATE, a two-stage multimodal framework that retrieves supporting evidence from a paper's body and assigns each claim an overstatement score. The framework consists of a dataset of over 10K claim-evidence sets from ICLR and NeurIPS papers, annotated using eight LLMs, with overstatement scores calibrated using peer-review comments and validated through human evaluation. It employes a fine-tuned reranker for evidence retrieval and a fine-tuned model to predict overstatement scores with justification. Compared to strong baselines, RIGOURATE enables improved evidence retrieval and overstatement detection. Overall, our work operationalises evidential proportionality and supports clearer, more transparent scientific communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores cross-lingual transfer in ASR for Indic dialects, finding phylogenetic distance insufficient to explain performance. Fine-tuning on small dialectal datasets can match larger standardized language datasets. Garhwali is studied as a case, and transcription errors reveal ASR biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how ASR performance varies across diverse Indic dialects and non-standardized speech, and to identify factors beyond phylogenetic distance affecting transfer learning.

Method: Empirical study analyzing ASR performance across Indic dialects, fine-tuning on dialectal data, and evaluating models on Garhwali. Transcription error analysis is conducted to assess biases.

Result: ASR performance improves with reduced phylogenetic distance but isn't fully explained by it. Fine-tuning on small dialectal datasets can rival larger standardized language datasets. Transcription errors reveal biases toward pre-training languages.

Conclusion: Phylogenetic distance alone doesn't fully predict ASR performance in dialects. Fine-tuning on dialectal data is effective, and biases in ASR systems need addressing for non-standardized speech.

Abstract: We conduct an empirical study of cross-lingual transfer using spontaneous, noisy, and code-mixed speech across a wide range of Indic dialects and language varieties. Our results indicate that although ASR performance is generally improved with reduced phylogenetic distance between languages, this factor alone does not fully explain performance in dialectal settings. Often, fine-tuning on smaller amounts of dialectal data yields performance comparable to fine-tuning on larger amounts of phylogenetically-related, high-resource standardized languages. We also present a case study on Garhwali, a low-resource Pahari language variety, and evaluate multiple contemporary ASR models. Finally, we analyze transcription errors to examine bias toward pre-training languages, providing additional insight into challenges faced by ASR systems on dialectal and non-standardized speech.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Disco-RAG is a discourse-aware framework that enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by incorporating discourse structures (intra-chunk trees and inter-chunk graphs) into LLMs' generation process, improving performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG strategies treat retrieved passages flatly, missing structural cues and hindering synthesis of dispersed knowledge. Addressing this gap can enhance LLM performance.

Method: Proposes Disco-RAG, which constructs intra-chunk discourse trees for local hierarchies and inter-chunk rhetorical graphs for cross-passage coherence, integrating these into a generation planning blueprint.

Result: Disco-RAG achieves state-of-the-art results on QA and summarization benchmarks without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Discourse structure plays a critical role in advancing RAG systems, as demonstrated by Disco-RAG's superior performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an important means of enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, most existing RAG strategies treat retrieved passages in a flat and unstructured way, which prevents the model from capturing structural cues and constrains its ability to synthesize knowledge from dispersed evidence across documents. To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence. These structures are jointly integrated into a planning blueprint that conditions the generation. Experiments on question answering and long-document summarization benchmarks show the efficacy of our approach. Disco-RAG achieves state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks without fine-tuning. These findings underscore the important role of discourse structure in advancing RAG systems.

### [95] [MiJaBench: Revealing Minority Biases in Large Language Models via Hate Speech Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04389)
*Iago Alves Brito,Walcy Santos Rezende Rios,Julia Soares Dollis,Diogo Fernandes Costa Silva,Arlindo Rodrigues Galvão Filho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiJaBench exposes systemic safety vulnerabilities in LLMs by revealing demographic-based disparities in safety alignment, worsened by model scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety evaluations mask systemic vulnerabilities against specific groups by aggregating metrics like 'Identity Hate' into scalar scores.

Method: Developed MiJaBench, a bilingual adversarial benchmark with 44,000 prompts across 16 minority groups, generating 528,000 prompt-response pairs from 12 LLMs.

Result: Safety alignment varies by up to 33% within models based on target demographics, showing it's not universal but hierarchical.

Conclusion: Model scaling worsens disparities, indicating current alignment techniques reinforce discriminatory refusal boundaries rather than non-discrimination principles.

Abstract: Current safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) create a dangerous illusion of universality, aggregating "Identity Hate" into scalar scores that mask systemic vulnerabilities against specific populations. To expose this selective safety, we introduce MiJaBench, a bilingual (English and Portuguese) adversarial benchmark comprising 44,000 prompts across 16 minority groups. By generating 528,000 prompt-response pairs from 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, we curate MiJaBench-Align, revealing that safety alignment is not a generalized semantic capability but a demographic hierarchy: defense rates fluctuate by up to 33\% within the same model solely based on the target group. Crucially, we demonstrate that model scaling exacerbates these disparities, suggesting that current alignment techniques do not create principle of non-discrimination but reinforces memorized refusal boundaries only for specific groups, challenging the current scaling laws of security. We release all datasets and scripts to encourage research into granular demographic alignment at GitHub.

### [96] [ARREST: Adversarial Resilient Regulation Enhancing Safety and Truth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04394)
*Sharanya Dasgupta,Arkaprabha Basu,Sujoy Nath,Swagatam Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARREST is a framework designed to regulate factual and safety misalignments in LLMs by correcting drifted features externally, without fine-tuning the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack human cognition to balance factuality and safety, leading to failures. The paper argues these failures stem from representational misalignment.

Method: An external network (ARREST) intervenes to regulate falsehoods and unsafe outputs, using adversarial training for soft and hard refusals.

Result: ARREST effectively corrects misalignment and outperforms RLHF-aligned models in generating soft refusals.

Conclusion: ARREST provides a versatile solution for improving LLM outputs by addressing misalignment externally.

Abstract: Human cognition, driven by complex neurochemical processes, oscillates between imagination and reality and learns to self-correct whenever such subtle drifts lead to hallucinations or unsafe associations. In recent years, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of tasks. However, they still lack human cognition to balance factuality and safety. Bearing the resemblance, we argue that both factual and safety failures in LLMs arise from a representational misalignment in their latent activation space, rather than addressing those as entirely separate alignment issues. We hypothesize that an external network, trained to understand the fluctuations, can selectively intervene in the model to regulate falsehood into truthfulness and unsafe output into safe output without fine-tuning the model parameters themselves. Reflecting the hypothesis, we propose ARREST (Adversarial Resilient Regulation Enhancing Safety and Truth), a unified framework that identifies and corrects drifted features, engaging both soft and hard refusals in addition to factual corrections. Our empirical results show that ARREST not only regulates misalignment but is also more versatile compared to the RLHF-aligned models in generating soft refusals due to adversarial training. We make our codebase available at https://github.com/sharanya-dasgupta001/ARREST.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of neural mechanisms in increasingly capable neural networks, highlighting the importance of mechanistic interpretability for accountability, cognition study, and knowledge discovery.

Method: The paper does not specify a method in the abstract, but the focus is on the concept of mechanistic interpretability and its applications.

Result: Mechanistic interpretability is identified as crucial for enabling accountability, studying digital cognition, and uncovering new knowledge when AI outperforms humans.

Conclusion: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks through mechanistic interpretability is essential for practical and scientific advancements.

Abstract: Neural networks are growing more capable on their own, but we do not understand their neural mechanisms.

### [98] [Gavel: Agent Meets Checklist for Evaluating LLMs on Long-Context Legal Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04424)
*Yao Dou,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs on multi-document legal case summarization using Gavel-Ref, revealing their limitations, and introduces Gavel-Agent to improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' effectiveness on complex long-context tasks, specifically legal case summarization, and address gaps in prior evaluations.

Method: Introduces Gavel-Ref for multi-value checklist and style evaluation, and Gavel-Agent for autonomous extraction using tools.

Result: Even top models like Gemini 2.5 Pro score only ~50 on Gavel-Ref, struggling with multi-value items. Gavel-Agent reduces tokens by 36% with minimal performance drop.

Conclusion: LLMs face challenges in legal summarization; Gavel-Agent offers a scalable solution for efficient extraction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support contexts of up to 1M tokens, but their effectiveness on complex long-context tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we study multi-document legal case summarization, where a single case often spans many documents totaling 100K-500K tokens. We introduce Gavel-Ref, a reference-based evaluation framework with multi-value checklist evaluation over 26 items, as well as residual fact and writing-style evaluations. Using Gavel-Ref, we go beyond the single aggregate scores reported in prior work and systematically evaluate 12 frontier LLMs on 100 legal cases ranging from 32K to 512K tokens, primarily from 2025. Our results show that even the strongest model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieves only around 50 of $S_{\text{Gavel-Ref}}$, highlighting the difficulty of the task. Models perform well on simple checklist items (e.g., filing date) but struggle on multi-value or rare ones such as settlements and monitor reports. As LLMs continue to improve and may surpass human-written summaries -- making human references less reliable -- we develop Gavel-Agent, an efficient and autonomous agent scaffold that equips LLMs with six tools to navigate and extract checklists directly from case documents. With Qwen3, Gavel-Agent reduces token usage by 36% while resulting in only a 7% drop in $S_{\text{checklist}}$ compared to end-to-end extraction with GPT-4.1.

*Myra Cheng,Robert D. Hawkins,Dan Jurafsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores why LLMs often fail to challenge harmful user beliefs and suggests pragmatic solutions like trigger phrases to improve their responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs frequently accommodate harmful user assumptions due to insufficient epistemic vigilance, leading to safety concerns in areas like medical advice and social reasoning.

Method: The study examines social and linguistic factors affecting accommodation in LLMs, testing performance on safety benchmarks (Cancer-Myth, SAGE-Eval, ELEPHANT). Simple interventions, like adding "wait a minute," are evaluated.

Result: Pragmatic interventions significantly improve LLMs' ability to challenge harmful beliefs without increasing false positives.

Conclusion: Pragmatics is crucial for evaluating and enhancing LLM safety to prevent accommodating harmful assumptions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently fail to challenge users' harmful beliefs in domains ranging from medical advice to social reasoning. We argue that these failures can be understood and addressed pragmatically as consequences of LLMs defaulting to accommodating users' assumptions and exhibiting insufficient epistemic vigilance. We show that social and linguistic factors known to influence accommodation in humans (at-issueness, linguistic encoding, and source reliability) similarly affect accommodation in LLMs, explaining performance differences across three safety benchmarks that test models' ability to challenge harmful beliefs, spanning misinformation (Cancer-Myth, SAGE-Eval) and sycophancy (ELEPHANT). We further show that simple pragmatic interventions, such as adding the phrase "wait a minute", significantly improve performance on these benchmarks while preserving low false-positive rates. Our results highlight the importance of considering pragmatics for evaluating LLM behavior and improving LLM safety.

### [100] [Learning to Simulate Human Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04436)
*Kanishk Gandhi,Agam Bhatia,Noah D. Goodman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores next-turn dialogue prediction, comparing learning approaches based on pre-response reasoning and reward mechanisms (LLM-as-a-judge vs. log-probability maximization). Judge-based rewards improve judge scores but reduce human likeness, while log-probability maximization better predicts actual human responses. Chain-of-thought as a latent variable enhances performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how people think by predicting their next utterance in dialogues, comparing different learning methods.

Method: Compare models on two dimensions: reasoning before responding and reward mechanisms (LLM-as-a-judge scoring vs. log-probability maximization). Introduce chain-of-thought as a latent variable for optimization.

Result: Judge-based rewards improve judge scores but degrade human likeness and win rates. Log-probability maximization outperforms, especially when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: Thinking aids dialogue prediction when grounded in human data. Scaling this approach may yield models with deeper behavioral understanding.

Abstract: To predict what someone will say is to model how they think. We study this through next-turn dialogue prediction: given a conversation, predict the next utterance produced by a person. We compare learning approaches along two dimensions: (1) whether the model is allowed to think before responding, and (2) how learning is rewarded either through an LLM-as-a-judge that scores semantic similarity and information completeness relative to the ground-truth response, or by directly maximizing the log-probability of the true human dialogue. We find that optimizing for judge-based rewards indeed increases judge scores throughout training, however it decreases the likelihood assigned to ground truth human responses and decreases the win rate when human judges choose the most human-like response among a real and synthetic option. This failure is amplified when the model is allowed to think before answering. In contrast, by directly maximizing the log-probability of observed human responses, the model learns to better predict what people actually say, improving on both log-probability and win rate evaluations. Treating chain-of-thought as a latent variable, we derive a lower bound on the log-probability. Optimizing this objective yields the best results on all our evaluations. These results suggest that thinking helps primarily when trained with a distribution-matching objective grounded in real human dialogue, and that scaling this approach to broader conversational data may produce models with a more nuanced understanding of human behavior.

### [101] [Merging Triggers, Breaking Backdoors: Defensive Poisoning for Instruction-Tuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04448)
*San Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MB-Defense is a novel pipeline immunizing instruction-tuned LLMs against backdoor attacks via defensive poisoning and weight recovery, reducing attack success while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-tuned LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks due to reliance on large-scale datasets. Current defenses are insufficient.

Method: MB-Defense uses defensive poisoning to merge triggers and weight recovery to break the unified backdoor representation.

Result: Experiments show MB-Defense lowers attack success rates and preserves instruction-following ability.

Conclusion: MB-Defense provides a robust, data-efficient defense against diverse backdoor threats in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly through instruction tuning, which enables broad task generalization without additional fine-tuning. However, their reliance on large-scale datasets-often collected from human or web sources-makes them vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison a small subset of data to implant hidden behaviors. Despite this growing risk, defenses for instruction-tuned models remain underexplored. We propose MB-Defense (Merging & Breaking Defense Framework), a novel training pipeline that immunizes instruction-tuned LLMs against diverse backdoor threats. MB-Defense comprises two stages: (i) defensive poisoning, which merges attacker and defensive triggers into a unified backdoor representation, and (ii) weight recovery, which breaks this representation through additional training to restore clean behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs show that MB-Defense substantially lowers attack success rates while preserving instruction-following ability. Our method offers a generalizable and data-efficient defense strategy, improving the robustness of instruction-tuned LLMs against unseen backdoor attacks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reveals a gap between users' stated preferences (urgency) and actual behavior (compositional effort) in proactive AI writing assistance, with behavioral-based systems outperforming preference-based ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what truly drives users' preferences for drafting help in proactive AI writing assistants, as current reliance on user introspection may mislead system design.

Method: A factorial vignette study involving 50 participants making 750 pairwise comparisons to measure the impact of factors like compositional effort and urgency.

Result: Compositional effort is the dominant behavioral driver (ρ=0.597), while urgency has no predictive power (ρ≈0). Systems using behavioral data (61.3% accuracy) outperform those based on stated preferences (57.7%).

Conclusion: User introspection is unreliable for designing proactive NLG systems; behavioral patterns should guide optimization instead.

Abstract: Proactive AI writing assistants need to predict when users want drafting help, yet we lack empirical understanding of what drives preferences. Through a factorial vignette study with 50 participants making 750 pairwise comparisons, we find compositional effort dominates decisions ($ρ= 0.597$) while urgency shows no predictive power ($ρ\approx 0$). More critically, users exhibit a striking perception-behavior gap: they rank urgency first in self-reports despite it being the weakest behavioral driver, representing a complete preference inversion. This misalignment has measurable consequences. Systems designed from users' stated preferences achieve only 57.7\% accuracy, underperforming even naive baselines, while systems using behavioral patterns reach significantly higher 61.3\% ($p < 0.05$). These findings demonstrate that relying on user introspection for system design actively misleads optimization, with direct implications for proactive natural language generation (NLG) systems.

### [103] [Beyond Static Summarization: Proactive Memory Extraction for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04463)
*Chengyuan Yang,Zequn Sun,Wei Wei,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMem introduces an iterative, feedback-driven approach to memory extraction for LLM agents, addressing limitations of static summarization by recovering missing details and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing summary-based memory extraction methods for LLM agents are 'ahead-of-time' and 'one-off', leading to missed details and information loss. This paper aims to improve memory completeness and accuracy by addressing these issues.

Method: The paper proposes ProMem, which treats memory extraction as an iterative cognitive process. It introduces a recurrent feedback loop where the agent uses self-questioning to actively probe dialogue history, recovering missing information and correcting errors.

Result: ProMem significantly improves memory completeness and QA accuracy while achieving a better trade-off between extraction quality and token cost.

Conclusion: ProMem's iterative and proactive approach outperforms static summarization, enhancing LLM agents' memory management for long-term interaction and personalization.

Abstract: Memory management is vital for LLM agents to handle long-term interaction and personalization. Most research focuses on how to organize and use memory summary, but often overlooks the initial memory extraction stage. In this paper, we argue that existing summary-based methods have two major limitations based on the recurrent processing theory. First, summarization is "ahead-of-time", acting as a blind "feed-forward" process that misses important details because it doesn't know future tasks. Second, extraction is usually "one-off", lacking a feedback loop to verify facts, which leads to the accumulation of information loss. To address these issues, we propose proactive memory extraction (namely ProMem). Unlike static summarization, ProMem treats extraction as an iterative cognitive process. We introduce a recurrent feedback loop where the agent uses self-questioning to actively probe the dialogue history. This mechanism allows the agent to recover missing information and correct errors. Our ProMem significantly improves the completeness of the extracted memory and QA accuracy. It also achieves a superior trade-off between extraction quality and token cost.

*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Concept Tokens add a special token to pretrained LLMs, learning its embedding from concept definitions while keeping the LLM frozen. Evaluations show directional effects on hallucinations and pedagogical tasks, outperforming in-context definitions in compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To introduce a lightweight method for controlling frozen LLMs by learning embeddings from concept definitions, addressing issues like hallucinations and instruction compliance.

Method: Adds a special token to pretrained LLMs, optimizes its embedding using the language-modeling objective from concept definitions, and evaluates in three settings: closed-book QA, recasting for language teaching, and qualitative analysis.

Result: Concept Tokens show directional effects on hallucinations and pedagogical tasks, with better compliance than in-context definitions. Limitations emerge in capturing specific information.

Conclusion: Concept Tokens offer a compact, definition-learned control signal for steering frozen LLMs, though with some limitations.

Abstract: We propose Concept Tokens, a lightweight method that adds a new special token to a pretrained LLM and learns only its embedding from multiple natural language definitions of a target concept, where occurrences of the concept are replaced by the new token. The LLM is kept frozen and the embedding is optimized with the standard language-modeling objective. We evaluate Concept Tokens in three settings. First, we study hallucinations in closed-book question answering on HotpotQA and find a directional effect: negating the hallucination token reduces hallucinated answers mainly by increasing abstentions, whereas asserting it increases hallucinations and lowers precision. Second, we induce recasting, a pedagogical feedback strategy for second language teaching, and observe the same directional effect. Moreover, compared to providing the full definitional corpus in-context, concept tokens better preserve compliance with other instructions (e.g., asking follow-up questions). Finally, we include a qualitative study with the Eiffel Tower and a fictional "Austral Tower" to illustrate what information the learned embeddings capture and where their limitations emerge. Overall, Concept Tokens provide a compact control signal learned from definitions that can steer behavior in frozen LLMs.

TL;DR: SampoNLP introduces a corpus-free toolkit for creating morphological lexicons in Uralic languages, enabling systematic evaluation of BPE tokenizers and providing empirical recommendations for optimal vocabulary sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of clean morpheme lexicons for evaluating tokenizers in morphologically rich Uralic languages.

Method: Uses MDL-inspired Self-Referential Atomicity Scoring to create high-purity lexicons for Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian, evaluates BPE tokenizers, and proposes the Integrated Performance Score (IPS) metric.

Result: Identifies optimal vocabulary sizes ('elbow points') for BPE tokenizers in Uralic languages and highlights limitations of standard BPE for agglutinative languages.

Conclusion: SampoNLP provides practical guidance and publicly available resources for tokenizer evaluation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: The quality of subword tokenization is critical for Large Language Models, yet evaluating tokenizers for morphologically rich Uralic languages is hampered by the lack of clean morpheme lexicons.
  We introduce SampoNLP, a corpus-free toolkit for morphological lexicon creation using MDL-inspired Self-Referential Atomicity Scoring, which filters composite forms through internal structural cues - suited for low-resource settings.
  Using the high-purity lexicons generated by SampoNLP for Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian, we conduct a systematic evaluation of BPE tokenizers across a range of vocabulary sizes (8k-256k). We propose a unified metric, the Integrated Performance Score (IPS), to navigate the trade-off between morpheme coverage and over-splitting. By analyzing the IPS curves, we identify the "elbow points" of diminishing returns and provide the first empirically grounded recommendations for optimal vocabulary sizes (k) in these languages. Our study not only offers practical guidance but also quantitatively demonstrates the limitations of standard BPE for highly agglutinative languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WESR-Bench, a refined taxonomy and evaluation framework for precise localization of non-verbal vocal events, addressing gaps in current methods and providing a strong baseline model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for localizing non-verbal vocal events lack comprehensive task definitions, standardized evaluation frameworks, and sufficient category coverage, hindering progress in the field.

Method: The authors develop a refined taxonomy of 21 vocal events, categorize them into discrete and continuous types, and introduce WESR-Bench—an expert-annotated evaluation set with a position-aware protocol. They also build a 1,700+ hour corpus and train specialized models.

Result: The proposed models outperform both open-source audio-language models and commercial APIs while maintaining ASR quality.

Conclusion: WESR-Bench serves as a foundational resource for future research in modeling rich auditory scenes, addressing current limitations in the field.

Abstract: Speech conveys not only linguistic information but also rich non-verbal vocal events such as laughing and crying. While semantic transcription is well-studied, the precise localization of non-verbal events remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Current methods suffer from insufficient task definitions with limited category coverage and ambiguous temporal granularity. They also lack standardized evaluation frameworks, hindering the development of downstream applications. To bridge this gap, we first develop a refined taxonomy of 21 vocal events, with a new categorization into discrete (standalone) versus continuous (mixed with speech) types. Based on the refined taxonomy, we introduce WESR-Bench, an expert-annotated evaluation set (900+ utterances) with a novel position-aware protocol that disentangles ASR errors from event detection, enabling precise localization measurement for both discrete and continuous events. We also build a strong baseline by constructing a 1,700+ hour corpus, and train specialized models, surpassing both open-source audio-language models and commercial APIs while preserving ASR quality. We anticipate that WESR will serve as a foundational resource for future research in modeling rich, real-world auditory scenes.

TL;DR: Proposes LinguaGame, a linguistically-grounded game-theoretic paradigm for improving communication efficiency in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems by modeling dialogue as intentional and strategic signaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance agents' communication efficiency in MASs by focusing on the interaction process itself, rather than just architecture design like role assignment or workflow orchestration.

Method: Introduces LinguaGame, modeling dialogue as a signaling game over communicative intents and strategies, solved with a training-free equilibrium approximation algorithm. Inspired by linguistic reasoning, it minimizes task-specific coupling.

Result: Evaluated in simulated courtroom proceedings and debates, LinguaGame shows significant gains in communication efficiency, as assessed by human experts.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves multi-agent dialogue generation by treating communication as intentional and strategic, demonstrating practical benefits in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) where agents interact through natural language to solve complex tasks or simulate multi-party dialogues. Recent work on LLM-based MASs has mainly focused on architecture design, such as role assignment and workflow orchestration. In contrast, this paper targets the interaction process itself, aiming to improve agents' communication efficiency by helping them convey their intended meaning more effectively through language. To this end, we propose LinguaGame, a linguistically-grounded game-theoretic paradigm for multi-agent dialogue generation. Our approach models dialogue as a signalling game over communicative intents and strategies, solved with a training-free equilibrium approximation algorithm for inference-time decision adjustment. Unlike prior game-theoretic MASs, whose game designs are often tightly coupled with task-specific objectives, our framework relies on linguistically informed reasoning with minimal task-specific coupling. Specifically, it treats dialogue as intentional and strategic communication, requiring agents to infer what others aim to achieve (intents) and how they pursue those goals (strategies). We evaluate our framework in simulated courtroom proceedings and debates, with human expert assessments showing significant gains in communication efficiency.

*Yibo Zhao,Jiapeng Zhu,Zichen Ding,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRACE is a reinforcement-learning framework integrating evidence-based grounding and reliable abstention to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems often provide ungrounded correct answers or fabricated responses due to insufficient context. Existing solutions address these flaws independently, lacking a unified approach.

Method: GRACE uses heterogeneous retrievers for diverse training samples without manual annotation and employs a multi-stage gated reward function for evidence assessment, extraction, and abstention.

Result: GRACE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and balances accurate responses with rejection, requiring only 10% of the annotation costs compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: GRACE effectively mitigates RAG flaws by unifying evidence grounding and abstention, offering cost-efficient improvements.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs), yet systems remain susceptible to two critical flaws: providing correct answers without explicit grounded evidence and producing fabricated responses when the retrieved context is insufficient. While prior research has addressed these issues independently, a unified framework that integrates evidence-based grounding and reliable abstention is currently lacking. In this paper, we propose GRACE, a reinforcement-learning framework that simultaneously mitigates both types of flaws. GRACE employs a data construction method that utilizes heterogeneous retrievers to generate diverse training samples without manual annotation. A multi-stage gated reward function is then employed to train the model to assess evidence sufficiency, extract key supporting evidence, and provide answers or explicitly abstain. Experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate that GRACE achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and strikes a favorable balance between accurate response and rejection, while requiring only 10% of the annotation costs of prior methods.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates text watermarking methods for Bangla LLM generation, finding them vulnerable to cross-lingual attacks. A layered watermarking approach is proposed to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the underexplored robustness of text watermarking methods in low-resource languages like Bangla, especially under cross-lingual attacks.

Method: The paper evaluates KGW, EXP, and Waterfall methods under benign and RTT attack conditions, then proposes a layered watermarking strategy combining embedding-time and post-generation techniques.

Result: Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP perform well (>88% accuracy), but RTT attacks reduce accuracy drastically (9-13%). Layered watermarking improves post-RTT accuracy to 40-50%, a 3-4× relative gain.

Conclusion: Layered watermarking offers a practical, training-free solution for low-resource languages, balancing robustness and semantic quality.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for text generation, watermarking has become essential for authorship attribution, intellectual property protection, and misuse detection. While existing watermarking methods perform well in high-resource languages, their robustness in low-resource languages remains underexplored. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation. However, RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse below RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse to 9-13%, indicating a fundamental failure of token-level watermarking. To address this, we propose a layered watermarking strategy that combines embedding-time and post-generation watermarks. Experimental results show that layered watermarking improves post-RTT detection accuracy by 25-35%, achieving 40-50% accuracy, representing a 3$\times$ to 4$\times$ relative improvement over single-layer methods, at the cost of controlled semantic degradation. Our findings quantify the robustness-quality trade-off in multilingual watermarking and establish layered watermarking as a practical, training-free solution for low-resource languages such as Bangla. Our code and data will be made public.

Motivation: Existing methods for understanding LLM neurons are limited to ability-specific analyses and overlook inhibitory neurons and fortuitous behaviors, hindering task-focused applications.

Method: NeuronLLM applies functional antagonism principles, using contrastive learning to model neurons' opposing roles (good vs. bad) and augmented datasets to reduce chance-based answers.

Result: NeuronLLM outperforms existing methods across various LLMs in four NLP tasks, offering deeper insights into LLM functional organization.

Conclusion: NeuronLLM provides a more comprehensive and accurate framework for understanding LLM neurons, addressing gaps left by prior ability-specific approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks, but the complex mechanisms underlying their large-scale neurons remain opaque, posing significant challenges for understanding and steering LLMs. While recent studies made progress on identifying responsible neurons for certain abilities, these ability-specific methods are infeasible for task-focused scenarios requiring coordinated use of multiple abilities. Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization.

*Seongyeub Chu,Jongwoo Kim,Munyong Yi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FeedEval is an LLM-based framework designed to evaluate and filter high-quality essay feedback along pedagogical dimensions (specificity, helpfulness, validity), improving downstream scoring and revision outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of quality validation in LLM-generated feedback used for essay scoring, which propagates noise and limits effectiveness.

Method: FeedEval uses dimension-specialized LLM evaluators trained on curated datasets to assess and select high-quality feedback.

Result: FeedEval aligns with human judgments, improves scoring performance, and enhances essay revisions using small LLMs.

Conclusion: FeedEval successfully validates and filters high-quality feedback, benefiting automated essay scoring and student revisions.

Abstract: Going beyond the prediction of numerical scores, recent research in automated essay scoring has increasingly emphasized the generation of high-quality feedback that provides justification and actionable guidance. To mitigate the high cost of expert annotation, prior work has commonly relied on LLM-generated feedback to train essay assessment models. However, such feedback is often incorporated without explicit quality validation, resulting in the propagation of noise in downstream applications. To address this limitation, we propose FeedEval, an LLM-based framework for evaluating LLM-generated essay feedback along three pedagogically grounded dimensions: specificity, helpfulness, and validity. FeedEval employs dimension-specialized LLM evaluators trained on datasets curated in this study to assess multiple feedback candidates and select high-quality feedback for downstream use. Experiments on the ASAP++ benchmark show that FeedEval closely aligns with human expert judgments and that essay scoring models trained with FeedEval-filtered high-quality feedback achieve superior scoring performance. Furthermore, revision experiments using small LLMs show that the high-quality feedback identified by FeedEval leads to more effective essay revisions. We will release our code and curated datasets upon accepted.

*Mizanur Rahman,Mohammed Saidul Islam,Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Shafiq Joty,Enamul Hoque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL-Text2Vis introduces a reinforcement learning framework for Text2Vis, improving visualization quality and code executability over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text2Vis systems lack semantic alignment and clarity in outputs, especially with open-source models, prompting the need for better post-execution feedback integration.

Method: Proposes RL-Text2Vis using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a multi-objective reward to optimize textual accuracy, code validity, and visualization quality.

Result: Achieves 22% better chart quality than GPT-4o and boosts code execution success from 78% to 97%. Outperforms baselines and generalizes well to out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: RL-Text2Vis sets a new benchmark for Text2Vis tasks, demonstrating GRPO's effectiveness in multimodal visualization generation.

Abstract: Text-to-Visualization (Text2Vis) systems translate natural language queries over tabular data into concise answers and executable visualizations. While closed-source LLMs generate functional code, the resulting charts often lack semantic alignment and clarity, qualities that can only be assessed post-execution. Open-source models struggle even more, frequently producing non-executable or visually poor outputs. Although supervised fine-tuning can improve code executability, it fails to enhance overall visualization quality, as traditional SFT loss cannot capture post-execution feedback. To address this gap, we propose RL-Text2Vis, the first reinforcement learning framework for Text2Vis generation. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our method uses a novel multi-objective reward that jointly optimizes textual accuracy, code validity, and visualization quality using post-execution feedback. By training Qwen2.5 models (7B and 14B), RL-Text2Vis achieves a 22% relative improvement in chart quality over GPT-4o on the Text2Vis benchmark and boosts code execution success from 78% to 97% relative to its zero-shot baseline. Our models significantly outperform strong zero-shot and supervised baselines and also demonstrate robust generalization to out-of-domain datasets like VIS-Eval and NVBench. These results establish GRPO as an effective strategy for structured, multimodal reasoning in visualization generation. We release our code at https://github.com/vis-nlp/RL-Text2Vis.

TL;DR: The paper explores model merging as a cost-effective method to create multi-capability LLMs, demonstrating improved performance in Thai language and financial tasks by merging Qwen-8B with ThaiLLM-8B and THaLLE-CFA-8B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face trade-offs between deploying specialized models or expensive multi-capability models; model merging offers a resource-efficient solution.

Method: Experiments involve merging Qwen-8B with ThaiLLM-8B and THaLLE-CFA-8B to evaluate performance improvements in Thai language and financial benchmarks.

Result: Merging models enhanced Thai general capabilities (measured by M3 and M6 O-NET) and financial performance (Flare-CFA and Thai-IC benchmarks).

Conclusion: Model merging is viable for efficiently developing high-performance, multi-capability LLMs, addressing deployment and cost challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, particularly in banking and finance, where they can automate complex tasks and enhance decision-making at scale. Due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns, organizations often prefer on-premise deployment of LLMs. The ThaiLLM initiative aims to enhance Thai language capabilities in open-LLMs, enabling Thai industry to leverage advanced language models. However, organizations often face a trade-off between deploying multiple specialized models versus the prohibitive expense of training a single multi-capability model. To address this, we explore model merging as a resource-efficient alternative for developing high-performance, multi-capability LLMs. We present results from two key experiments: first, merging Qwen-8B with ThaiLLM-8B demonstrates how ThaiLLM-8B enhances Thai general capabilities, showing an uplift of M3 and M6 O-NET exams over the general instruction-following Qwen-8B. Second, we merge Qwen-8B with both ThaiLLM-8B and THaLLE-CFA-8B. This combination results in further improvements in performance across both general and financial domains, by demonstrating an uplift in both M3 and M6 O-NET, Flare-CFA, and Thai-IC benchmarks. The report showcases the viability of model merging for efficiently creating multi-capability LLMs.

*Zhiyuan He,Binghan Chen,Tianxiang Xiong,Ziyang Sun,Mozhao Zhu,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations of ROME in multi-hop reasoning, identifies three failure modes, and proposes Redundant Editing to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the effectiveness of knowledge editing (KE) methods like ROME for multi-hop reasoning tasks, overcoming challenges like late layer access, generalization decay, and overfitting.

Method: Analyzed ROME's performance across layer depths, identified failure modes, and introduced Redundant Editing to improve multi-hop reasoning.

Result: Redundant Editing improved accuracy on 2-hop questions by at least 15.5 percentage points (96% increase over single-edit).

Conclusion: Redundant Editing effectively mitigates key issues in multi-hop reasoning for KE, though it trades off some specificity and naturalness.

Abstract: Recent advances in Knowledge Editing (KE), particularly Rank-One Model Editing (ROME), show superior efficiency over fine-tuning and in-context learning for updating single-hop facts in transformers. However, these methods face significant challenges when applied to multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring knowledge chaining. In this work, we study the effect of editing knowledge with ROME on different layer depths and identify three key failure modes. First, the "hopping-too-late" problem occurs as later layers lack access to necessary intermediate representations. Second, generalization ability deteriorates sharply when editing later layers. Third, the model overfits to edited knowledge, incorrectly prioritizing edited-hop answers regardless of context. To mitigate the issues of "hopping-too-late" and generalisation decay, we propose Redundant Editing, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances multi-hop reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach can improve accuracy on 2-hop questions by at least 15.5 percentage points, representing a 96% increase over the previous single-edit strategy, while trading off some specificity and language naturalness.

*Rhea Kapur,Robert Hawkins,Elisa Kreiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that description specificity in VLMs should be distinct from length, validates human preference for specificity, and emphasizes prioritizing specificity over verbosity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle specificity and length in vision-language models, as current systems often conflate them, leading to descriptions that may be lengthy but lack meaningful information.

Method: Defines specificity relative to a contrast set, constructs a dataset controlling length while varying information content, and validates human preferences.

Result: Human participants reliably prefer more specific descriptions regardless of length, showing that how length is allocated impacts specificity.

Conclusion: Evaluation approaches should prioritize specificity directly, as length alone does not guarantee meaningful descriptions.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to make visual content accessible via text-based descriptions. In current systems, however, description specificity is often conflated with their length. We argue that these two concepts must be disentangled: descriptions can be concise yet dense with information, or lengthy yet vacuous. We define specificity relative to a contrast set, where a description is more specific to the extent that it picks out the target image better than other possible images. We construct a dataset that controls for length while varying information content, and validate that people reliably prefer more specific descriptions regardless of length. We find that controlling for length alone cannot account for differences in specificity: how the length budget is allocated makes a difference. These results support evaluation approaches that directly prioritize specificity over verbosity.

*Yihong Tang,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Benyou Wang,Zeming Liu,Haifeng Wang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Character-R1 is a framework addressing cognitive inconsistency in RPAs by introducing three core reward designs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RPAs imitate surface behaviors, lacking cognitive consistency and causing out-of-character errors in complex scenarios.

Method: Character-R1 includes Cognitive Focus Reward, Reference-Guided Reward, and Character-Conditioned Reward Normalization to enhance role-aware reasoning.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms existing methods in knowledge, memory, and other metrics.

Conclusion: Character-R1 provides verifiable reward signals for robust role-playing, improving cognitive consistency.

Abstract: Current role-playing agents (RPAs) are typically constructed by imitating surface-level behaviors, but this approach lacks internal cognitive consistency, often causing out-of-character errors in complex situations. To address this, we propose Character-R1, a framework designed to provide comprehensive verifiable reward signals for effective role-aware reasoning, which are missing in recent studies. Specifically, our framework comprises three core designs: (1) Cognitive Focus Reward, which enforces explicit label-based analysis of 10 character elements (e.g., worldview) to structure internal cognition; (2) Reference-Guided Reward, which utilizes overlap-based metrics with reference responses as optimization anchors to enhance exploration and performance; and (3) Character-Conditioned Reward Normalization, which adjusts reward distributions based on character categories to ensure robust optimization across heterogeneous roles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Character-R1 significantly outperforms existing methods in knowledge, memory and others.

TL;DR: CuCu is an automated framework using LLMs to create culture-specific QA pairs from national curricula, exemplified by KCaQA for Korean social studies, showing promising cultural alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the uneven performance of LLMs across languages and cultures by leveraging national curricula for culture-aware supervision.

Method: Develop CuCu, a multi-agent LLM framework, to convert national textbook curricula into culture-specific QA pairs, applied to Korean social studies.

Result: Created KCaQA with 34.1k QA pairs, covering culture-specific topics and generating responses grounded in local contexts.

Conclusion: CuCu effectively supports cultural alignment in LLMs, demonstrated by the successful creation of KCaQA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on many tasks, but their progress remains uneven across languages and cultures, often reflecting values latent in English-centric training data. To enable practical cultural alignment, we propose a scalable approach that leverages national social studies curricula as a foundation for culture-aware supervision. We introduce CuCu, an automated multi-agent LLM framework that transforms national textbook curricula into open-ended, culture-specific question-answer pairs. Applying CuCu to the Korean national social studies curriculum, we construct KCaQA, comprising 34.1k open-ended QA pairs. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that KCaQA covers culture-specific topics and produces responses grounded in local sociocultural contexts.

*Anyang Song,Ying Cheng,Yiqian Xu,Rui Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAGA, a method to enhance the alignment of machine-generated text (MGT) to improve detector robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing difficulty in distinguishing MGT from human-written text (HWT) raises abuse concerns like fake news and fraud. Current detectors lack generalization due to poor dataset quality.

Method: MAGA involves comprehensive alignment from prompt construction to reasoning, using Reinforced Learning from Detectors Feedback (RLDF) as a key component.

Result: MAGA improved the RoBERTa detector's generalization detection AUC by 4.60% and reduced other detectors' AUC by 8.13%.

Conclusion: MAGA demonstrates potential for improving detector generalization and robustness, providing insights for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment is constantly evolving. Machine-Generated Text (MGT) is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from Human-Written Text (HWT). This has exacerbated abuse issues such as fake news and online fraud. Fine-tuned detectors' generalization ability is highly dependent on dataset quality, and simply expanding the sources of MGT is insufficient. Further augment of generation process is required. According to HC-Var's theory, enhancing the alignment of generated text can not only facilitate attacks on existing detectors to test their robustness, but also help improve the generalization ability of detectors fine-tuned on it. Therefore, we propose \textbf{M}achine-\textbf{A}ugment-\textbf{G}enerated Text via \textbf{A}lignment (MAGA). MAGA's pipeline achieves comprehensive alignment from prompt construction to reasoning process, among which \textbf{R}einforced \textbf{L}earning from \textbf{D}etectors \textbf{F}eedback (RLDF), systematically proposed by us, serves as a key component. In our experiments, the RoBERTa detector fine-tuned on MAGA training set achieved an average improvement of 4.60\% in generalization detection AUC. MAGA Dataset caused an average decrease of 8.13\% in the AUC of the selected detectors, expecting to provide indicative significance for future research on the generalization detection ability of detectors.

*Sirry Chen,Jieyi Wang,Wei Chen,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpeechMedAssist is a speech language model designed for medical consultations, reducing the need for extensive medical speech data by using a two-stage training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical consultation tools rely on text, which is cumbersome. SpeechLMs offer natural interaction but face challenges due to data scarcity and inefficiency.

Method: Decouples training into two stages: Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data.

Result: Outperforms baselines in effectiveness and robustness for single-turn QA and multi-turn interactions.

Conclusion: SpeechMedAssist enables efficient, data-light speech-based medical consultations.

Abstract: Medical consultations are intrinsically speech-centric. However, most prior works focus on long-text-based interactions, which are cumbersome and patient-unfriendly. Recent advances in speech language models (SpeechLMs) have enabled more natural speech-based interaction, yet the scarcity of medical speech data and the inefficiency of directly fine-tuning on speech data jointly hinder the adoption of SpeechLMs in medical consultation. In this paper, we propose SpeechMedAssist, a SpeechLM natively capable of conducting speech-based multi-turn interactions with patients. By exploiting the architectural properties of SpeechLMs, we decouple the conventional one-stage training into a two-stage paradigm consisting of (1) Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and (2) Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data, thereby reducing the requirement for medical speech data to only 10k synthesized samples. To evaluate SpeechLMs for medical consultation scenarios, we design a benchmark comprising both single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all baselines in both effectiveness and robustness in most evaluation settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRANE proposes a relevance-based framework to analyze language-specific neurons in multilingual LLMs, offering better precision than activation-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how language capabilities are organized neuronally in multilingual LLMs, as current activation-based methods conflate language preference with functional importance.

Method: CRANE uses targeted neuron-level interventions and defines language specificity by functional necessity, measuring neuron contribution to predictions.

Result: Experiments show CRANE isolates language-specific components more precisely, revealing asymmetric neuron specializations that degrade performance selectively.

Conclusion: CRANE provides a more accurate framework for analyzing neuron-level language specialization in multilingual models.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across languages, yet how language capabilities are organized at the neuron level remains poorly understood. Prior work has identified language-related neurons mainly through activation-based heuristics, which conflate language preference with functional importance. Prior work has identified language-related neurons mainly through activation-based heuristics, which conflate language preference with functional importance. We propose CRANE, a relevance-based analysis framework that redefines language specificity in terms of functional necessity, identifying language-specific neurons through targeted neuron-level interventions. CRANE characterizes neuron specialization by their contribution to language-conditioned predictions rather than activation magnitude. Our implementation will be made publicly available. Neuron-level interventions reveal a consistent asymmetric pattern: masking neurons relevant to a target language selectively degrades performance on that language while preserving performance on other languages to a substantial extent, indicating language-selective but non-exclusive neuron specializations. Experiments on English, Chinese, and Vietnamese across multiple benchmarks, together with a dedicated relevance-based metric and base-to-chat model transfer analysis, show that CRANE isolates language-specific components more precisely than activation-based methods.

TL;DR: ToolGate is a framework ensuring logical safety and verifiable state evolution in LLM tool calling, using symbolic states and Hoare-style contracts for reliable tool-augmented reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks lack formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability in LLM tool calling, necessitating a more structured approach.

Method: ToolGate uses symbolic state spaces and Hoare-style contracts (pre/postconditions) to gate tool invocation and commit verified results.

Result: ToolGate improves reliability and verifiability while maintaining competitive performance in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: ToolGate provides a foundation for trustworthy and debuggable AI systems integrating LLMs with tools.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with external tools have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation. Experimental validation demonstrates that ToolGate significantly improves the reliability and verifiability of tool-augmented LLM systems while maintaining competitive performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This work establishes a foundation for building more trustworthy and debuggable AI systems that integrate language models with external tools.

TL;DR: A study on detecting, explaining, and intervening hateful memes using generative AI models, proposing a novel framework for moderation under limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of integrated studies on detection, explanation, and intervention of hateful memes, and overcoming the high cost of annotated datasets.

Method: Uses task-specific generative multimodal agents and few-shot adaptability of large multimodal models for meme moderation.

Result: Proposes a novel framework effective for generalizable hateful meme moderation with limited data.

Conclusion: This approach is innovative and practical for real-world deployment in meme moderation.

Abstract: In this work, we examine hateful memes from three complementary angles - how to detect them, how to explain their content and how to intervene them prior to being posted - by applying a range of strategies built on top of generative AI models. To the best of our knowledge, explanation and intervention have typically been studied separately from detection, which does not reflect real-world conditions. Further, since curating large annotated datasets for meme moderation is prohibitively expensive, we propose a novel framework that leverages task-specific generative multimodal agents and the few-shot adaptability of large multimodal models to cater to different types of memes. We believe this is the first work focused on generalizable hateful meme moderation under limited data conditions, and has strong potential for deployment in real-world production scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of benchmarks for evaluating negation understanding in Korean LLMs prompted the creation of Thunder-KoNUBench.

Method: A corpus-based analysis of Korean negation was conducted, followed by the introduction and evaluation of Thunder-KoNUBench across 47 LLMs.

Result: LLM performance degrades under negation, but fine-tuning on Thunder-KoNUBench improves negation understanding and contextual comprehension.

Conclusion: Thunder-KoNUBench effectively addresses the evaluation gap and demonstrates the benefits of fine-tuning for negation understanding in Korean LLMs.

Abstract: Although negation is known to challenge large language models (LLMs), benchmarks for evaluating negation understanding, especially in Korean, are scarce. We conduct a corpus-based analysis of Korean negation and show that LLM performance degrades under negation. We then introduce Thunder-KoNUBench, a sentence-level benchmark that reflects the empirical distribution of Korean negation phenomena. Evaluating 47 LLMs, we analyze the effects of model size and instruction tuning, and show that fine-tuning on Thunder-KoNUBench improves negation understanding and broader contextual comprehension in Korean.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A plug-and-play method using prior-informed perturbations improves zeroth-order optimization for fine-tuning LLMs, achieving faster convergence and better performance than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory overhead and slow convergence of traditional zeroth-order optimization in fine-tuning large language models.

Method: Incorporates prior-informed perturbations and dynamically computes guiding vectors from Gaussian samples to refine gradient estimation. Also explores a greedy perturbation strategy.

Result: Achieves faster convergence and superior performance, outperforming traditional zeroth-order optimization on OPT-13B across 11 benchmark tasks and surpassing gradient-based baselines on 9 tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances efficiency and accuracy, integrating seamlessly into existing optimization frameworks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, but the substantial memory overhead during backpropagation remains a critical bottleneck, especially as model scales grow. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization alleviates this issue by estimating gradients through forward passes and Gaussian sampling, avoiding the need for backpropagation. However, conventional ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation due to their reliance on random perturbations, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance. We propose a simple plug-and-play method that incorporates prior-informed perturbations to refine gradient estimation. Our method dynamically computes a guiding vector from Gaussian samples, which directs perturbations toward more informative directions, significantly accelerating convergence compared to standard ZO approaches. We further investigate a greedy perturbation strategy to explore the impact of prior knowledge on gradient estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our gradient estimator achieves stronger alignment with the true gradient direction, enhancing optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments across LLMs of varying scales and architectures demonstrate that our proposed method could seamlessly integrate into existing optimization methods, delivering faster convergence and superior performance. Notably, on the OPT-13B model, our method outperforms traditional ZO optimization across all 11 benchmark tasks and surpasses gradient-based baselines on 9 out of 11 tasks, establishing a robust balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, a shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs, using the ViHallu dataset with 10K annotated samples. The best system achieved an 84.80% macro-F1 score, showing progress but highlighting challenges, especially for intrinsic hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for hallucination detection in low-to-medium resource languages like Vietnamese, aiming to improve LLM reliability.

Method: Created the ViHallu dataset with annotated (context, prompt, response) triplets categorized into three hallucination types, and evaluated 111 teams' models using factual, noisy, and adversarial prompts.

Result: The top-performing system achieved an 84.80% macro-F1 score, significantly outperforming the baseline (32.83%), though intrinsic hallucinations remained challenging.

Conclusion: The ViHallu Challenge sets a benchmark for Vietnamese hallucination detection, showing that structured prompting and ensemble strategies improve performance, but further research is needed.

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) in production environments remains significantly constrained by their propensity to generate hallucinations--fluent, plausible-sounding outputs that contradict or fabricate information. While hallucination detection has recently emerged as a priority in English-centric benchmarks, low-to-medium resource languages such as Vietnamese remain inadequately covered by standardized evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, the first large-scale shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs. We present the ViHallu dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated triplets of (context, prompt, response) samples systematically partitioned into three hallucination categories: no hallucination, intrinsic, and extrinsic hallucinations. The dataset incorporates three prompt types--factual, noisy, and adversarial--to stress-test model robustness. A total of 111 teams participated, with the best-performing system achieving a macro-F1 score of 84.80\%, compared to a baseline encoder-only score of 32.83\%, demonstrating that instruction-tuned LLMs with structured prompting and ensemble strategies substantially outperform generic architectures. However, the gap to perfect performance indicates that hallucination detection remains a challenging problem, particularly for intrinsic (contradiction-based) hallucinations. This work establishes a rigorous benchmark and explores a diverse range of detection methodologies, providing a foundation for future research into the trustworthiness and reliability of Vietnamese language AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Character Identity' for RPAs, splitting it into Parametric and Attributive Identity, and finds that fame's impact fades quickly while personality traits and moral values remain crucial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to formalize character identity in RPAs, addressing the lack of structured dimensions defining characters beyond arbitrary text inputs.

Method: Proposes a unified character profile schema, generates Famous and Synthetic characters under identical constraints, and evaluates them in single-turn and multi-turn interactions.

Result: Finds 'Fame Fades' (famous characters lose initial advantage) and 'Nature Remains' (personality traits persist, moral valence affects fidelity).

Conclusion: Negative social natures are identified as a bottleneck in RPA fidelity, guiding future character design and evaluation.

Abstract: Despite the rapid proliferation of Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) based on Large Language Models (LLMs), the structural dimensions defining a character's identity remain weakly formalized, often treating characters as arbitrary text inputs. In this paper, we propose the concept of \textbf{Character Identity}, a multidimensional construct that disentangles a character into two distinct layers: \textbf{(1) Parametric Identity}, referring to character-specific knowledge encoded from the LLM's pre-training, and \textbf{(2) Attributive Identity}, capturing fine-grained behavioral properties such as personality traits and moral values. To systematically investigate these layers, we construct a unified character profile schema and generate both Famous and Synthetic characters under identical structural constraints. Our evaluation across single-turn and multi-turn interactions reveals two critical phenomena. First, we identify \textit{"Fame Fades"}: while famous characters hold a significant advantage in initial turns due to parametric knowledge, this edge rapidly vanishes as models prioritize accumulating conversational context over pre-trained priors. Second, we find that \textit{"Nature Remains"}: while models robustly portray general personality traits regardless of polarity, RPA performance is highly sensitive to the valence of morality and interpersonal relationships. Our findings pinpoint negative social natures as the primary bottleneck in RPA fidelity, guiding future character construction and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The report introduces Qwen3-VL-Embedding and Qwen3-VL-Reranker models, extending the Qwen family for multimodal search by unifying text, images, document images, and video representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multimodal search precision by creating a unified representation space and supporting multilingual capabilities.

Method: Uses multi-stage training (contrastive pre-training to distillation), Matryoshka Representation Learning, and cross-encoder architecture for relevance estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results (e.g., 77.8 on MMEB-V2) and supports 30+ languages with 2B and 8B parameter sizes.

Conclusion: The models excel in multimodal retrieval tasks, demonstrating effectiveness in embedding and reranking for diverse applications.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Qwen3-VL-Embedding and Qwen3-VL-Reranker model series, the latest extensions of the Qwen family built on the Qwen3-VL foundation model. Together, they provide an end-to-end pipeline for high-precision multimodal search by mapping diverse modalities, including text, images, document images, and video, into a unified representation space. The Qwen3-VL-Embedding model employs a multi-stage training paradigm, progressing from large-scale contrastive pre-training to reranking model distillation, to generate semantically rich high-dimensional vectors. It supports Matryoshka Representation Learning, enabling flexible embedding dimensions, and handles inputs up to 32k tokens. Complementing this, Qwen3-VL-Reranker performs fine-grained relevance estimation for query-document pairs using a cross-encoder architecture with cross-attention mechanisms. Both model series inherit the multilingual capabilities of Qwen3-VL, supporting more than 30 languages, and are released in $\textbf{2B}$ and $\textbf{8B}$ parameter sizes to accommodate diverse deployment requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3-VL-Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse multimodal embedding evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B attains an overall score of $\textbf{77.8}$ on MMEB-V2, ranking first among all models (as of January 8, 2025). This report presents the architecture, training methodology, and practical capabilities of the series, demonstrating their effectiveness on various multimodal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and video-text matching.

*Ivan Smirnov,Segun T. Aroyehun,Paul Plener,David Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights gender biases in emotion detection models, showing higher error rates for texts authored by men compared to women, and underscores the need for caution in applying these tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of sentiment and emotion classifiers across different populations, particularly focusing on gender biases, as current benchmarks may conceal systematic biases.

Method: Utilized a large-scale dataset of over one million self-annotated posts and a pre-registered design to analyze gender biases across 414 model and emotion-class combinations.

Result: Error rates were consistently higher for texts authored by men compared to women, indicating systematic gender biases in emotion detection.

Conclusion: Sentiment analysis lacks equitable performance across genders, and current tools, including large language models, should be used cautiously when gender composition is unknown or variable.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of automatic sentiment and emotion classifiers makes it important to ensure that these tools perform reliably across different populations. Yet their reliability is typically assessed using benchmarks that rely on third-party annotators rather than the individuals experiencing the emotions themselves, potentially concealing systematic biases. In this paper, we use a unique, large-scale dataset of more than one million self-annotated posts and a pre-registered research design to investigate gender biases in emotion detection across 414 combinations of models and emotion-related classes. We find that across different types of automatic classifiers and various underlying emotions, error rates are consistently higher for texts authored by men compared to those authored by women. We quantify how this bias could affect results in downstream applications and show that current machine learning tools, including large language models, should be applied with caution when the gender composition of a sample is not known or variable. Our findings demonstrate that sentiment analysis is not yet a solved problem, especially in ensuring equitable model behaviour across demographic groups.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InterSafe-V dataset and AM$^3$Safety framework improve safety in multi-modal dialogues, reducing attack success rates by 10% and enhancing helpfulness/harmlessness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety vulnerabilities in multi-turn multi-modal scenarios where existing RLHF methods are ineffective due to high costs and single-turn limitations.

Method: Introduce InterSafe-V dataset (11,270 dialogues) and AM$^3$Safety framework with cold-start refusal and GRPO fine-tuning using turn-aware dual-objective rewards.

Result: 10% decrease in Attack Success Rate (ASR); 8% and 13% improvements in harmless and helpful dimensions, respectively, preserving general abilities.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework effectively enhance multi-modal dialogue safety without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive applications. However, their safety vulnerabilities become pronounced in multi-turn multi-modal scenarios, where harmful intent can be gradually reconstructed across turns, and security protocols fade into oblivion as the conversation progresses. Existing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) alignment methods are largely developed for single-turn visual question-answer (VQA) task and often require costly manual preference annotations, limiting their effectiveness and scalability in dialogues. To address this challenge, we present InterSafe-V, an open-source multi-modal dialogue dataset containing 11,270 dialogues and 500 specially designed refusal VQA samples. This dataset, constructed through interaction between several models, is designed to more accurately reflect real-world scenarios and includes specialized VQA pairs tailored for specific domains. Building on this dataset, we propose AM$^3$Safety, a framework that combines a cold-start refusal phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning using turn-aware dual-objective rewards across entire dialogues. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and LLaVA-NeXT-7B show more than 10\% decrease in Attack Success Rate (ASR) together with an increment of at least 8\% in harmless dimension and over 13\% in helpful dimension of MLLMs on multi-modal multi-turn safety benchmarks, while preserving their general abilities.

*Huawei Zheng,Xinqi Jiang,Sen Yang,Shouling Ji,Yingcai Wu,Dazhen Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for generating implicit harmful prompts in specialized domains to improve LLM safety testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific harmful prompts are scarce and often explicit, making them easier to detect. Implicit prompts reflect real-world threats better but are harder to create.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end framework: knowledge-graph-guided prompt generation and dual-path obfuscation rewriting to create implicit harmful prompts.

Result: Produces high-quality datasets combining domain relevance and implicitness, aiding realistic LLM safety testing.

Conclusion: The framework advances LLM safety research by enabling more effective red-teaming with domain-specific implicit prompts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in specialized domains such as finance and healthcare, where they introduce unique safety risks. Domain-specific datasets of harmful prompts remain scarce and still largely rely on manual construction; public datasets mainly focus on explicit harmful prompts, which modern LLM defenses can often detect and refuse. In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research. We release our code and datasets at GitHub.

*Seyeon Jeong,Yeonjun Choi,JongWook Kim,Beakcheol Jang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tool-MAD improves multi-agent debate accuracy by using diverse external tools and adaptive evidence retrieval, outperforming existing frameworks by up to 5.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce inaccurate or hallucinated answers in complex reasoning tasks. Existing Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) systems lack adaptability to evolving information during debates.

Method: Tool-MAD assigns distinct external tools (e.g., search APIs, RAG modules) to agents, employs adaptive query formulation, and integrates Faithfulness and Answer Relevance scores for decision-making.

Result: Tool-MAD achieves up to 5.5% higher accuracy on fact verification benchmarks and shows robustness in specialized domains like medicine.

Conclusion: Tool-MAD enhances factual verification with adaptive tools and iterative retrieval, proving effective for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations and factual inaccuracies, especially in complex reasoning and fact verification tasks. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) systems aim to improve answer accuracy by enabling multiple LLM agents to engage in dialogue, promoting diverse reasoning and mutual verification. However, existing MAD frameworks primarily rely on internal knowledge or static documents, making them vulnerable to hallucinations. While MADKE introduces external evidence to mitigate this, its one-time retrieval mechanism limits adaptability to new arguments or emerging information during the debate. To address these limitations, We propose Tool-MAD, a multi-agent debate framework that enhances factual verification by assigning each agent a distinct external tool, such as a search API or RAG module. Tool-MAD introduces three key innovations: (1) a multi-agent debate framework where agents leverage heterogeneous external tools, encouraging diverse perspectives, (2) an adaptive query formulation mechanism that iteratively refines evidence retrieval based on the flow of the debate, and (3) the integration of Faithfulness and Answer Relevance scores into the final decision process, allowing the Judge agent to quantitatively assess the coherence and question alignment of each response and effectively detect hallucinations. Experimental results on four fact verification benchmarks demonstrate that Tool-MAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MAD frameworks, achieving up to 5.5% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, in medically specialized domains, Tool-MAD exhibits strong robustness and adaptability across various tool configurations and domain conditions, confirming its potential for broader real-world fact-checking applications.

### [132] [PILOT-Bench: A Benchmark for Legal Reasoning in the Patent Domain with IRAC-Aligned Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04758)
*Yehoon Jang,Chaewon Lee,Hyun-seok Min,Sungchul Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PILOT-Bench is introduced as the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' structured legal reasoning in patent appeals, focusing on three IRAC-aligned tasks, revealing performance gaps between closed-source and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of systematic evaluation tools for LLMs in structured legal reasoning within the patent domain inspired the creation of PILOT-Bench.

Method: PILOT-Bench aligns PTAB decisions with USPTO patent data, formalizing three classification tasks (Issue Type, Board Authorities, Subdecision), and evaluates diverse LLMs.

Result: Closed-source models outperformed open-source ones, with Micro-F1 scores exceeding 0.75 vs. ~0.56 for the best open-source model (Qwen-8B).

Conclusion: PILOT-Bench provides a foundation for evaluating LLMs in patent-domain legal reasoning and suggests future improvements via dataset design and model alignment.

Abstract: The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the USPTO adjudicates thousands of ex parte appeals each year, requiring the integration of technical understanding and legal reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in patent and legal practice, their use has remained limited to lightweight tasks, with no established means of systematically evaluating their capacity for structured legal reasoning in the patent domain. In this work, we introduce PILOT-Bench, the first PTAB-centric benchmark that aligns PTAB decisions with USPTO patent data at the case-level and formalizes three IRAC-aligned classification tasks: Issue Type, Board Authorities, and Subdecision. We evaluate a diverse set of closed-source (commercial) and open-source LLMs and conduct analyses across multiple perspectives, including input-variation settings, model families, and error tendencies. Notably, on the Issue Type task, closed-source models consistently exceed 0.75 in Micro-F1 score, whereas the strongest open-source model (Qwen-8B) achieves performance around 0.56, highlighting a substantial gap in reasoning capabilities. PILOT-Bench establishes a foundation for the systematic evaluation of patent-domain legal reasoning and points toward future directions for improving LLMs through dataset design and model alignment.

### [133] [Differential syntactic and semantic encoding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04765)
*Santiago Acevedo,Alessandro Laio,Marco Baroni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how syntactic and semantic information is encoded in the inner layers of DeepSeek-V3 LLMs, revealing that averaging sentence vectors captures much of this information linearly. Syntax and semantics have distinct encoding profiles and can be partially decoupled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the encoding mechanisms of syntactic and semantic information in LLMs, specifically focusing on DeepSeek-V3, to uncover how these linguistic features are processed and represented.

Method: Researchers averaged hidden-representation vectors of sentences with shared syntactic structure or meaning to create "centroids." They then subtracted these centroids from sentence vectors to analyze their impact on similarity with syntactically or semantically matched sentences.

Result: Subtracting syntactic and semantic centroids significantly altered sentence similarity, indicating linear encoding. Syntax and semantics exhibited different cross-layer encoding profiles and could be partially decoupled.

Conclusion: Syntax and semantics are partially linearly encoded in DeepSeek-V3, with distinct encoding profiles, suggesting differential processing of these linguistic features in LLM representations.

Abstract: We study how syntactic and semantic information is encoded in inner layer representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the very large DeepSeek-V3. We find that, by averaging hidden-representation vectors of sentences sharing syntactic structure or meaning, we obtain vectors that capture a significant proportion of the syntactic and semantic information contained in the representations. In particular, subtracting these syntactic and semantic ``centroids'' from sentence vectors strongly affects their similarity with syntactically and semantically matched sentences, respectively, suggesting that syntax and semantics are, at least partially, linearly encoded. We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Judge Decoding accelerates LLM inference by replacing costly supervision with KL divergence-based verification, matching or outperforming trained judges while eliminating supervision needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce reliance on expensive and noisy supervision in Judge Decoding by leveraging intrinsic properties of draft-target divergence.

Method: The authors propose a training-free verification mechanism using KL divergence, theoretically linking it to learned linear judges.

Result: Experiments show their method matches or outperforms trained judges (e.g., AutoJudge) and improves robustness to domain shifts.

Conclusion: The work successfully eliminates the supervision bottleneck in Judge Decoding, offering a simpler yet effective alternative.

Abstract: Judge Decoding accelerates LLM inference by relaxing the strict verification of Speculative Decoding, yet it typically relies on expensive and noisy supervision. In this work, we revisit this paradigm from first principles, revealing that the ``criticality'' scores learned via costly supervision are intrinsically encoded in the draft-target distributional divergence. We theoretically prove a structural correspondence between learned linear judges and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, demonstrating they rely on the same underlying logit primitives. Guided by this, we propose a simple, training-free verification mechanism based on KL divergence. Extensive experiments across reasoning and coding benchmarks show that our method matches or outperforms complex trained judges (e.g., AutoJudge), offering superior robustness to domain shifts and eliminating the supervision bottleneck entirely.

*Dongjun Kim,Jeongho Yoon,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LANGSAE EDITING is a post-hoc method to remove language-identity signals from multilingual embeddings, improving cross-language retrieval quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual embeddings often encode language identity, which can bias similarity scores toward same-language pairs, reducing cross-language retrieval effectiveness.

Method: The approach uses a sparse autoencoder to identify and suppress language-associated latent units based on cross-language activation statistics, reconstructing embeddings in their original dimensionality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved ranking quality and cross-language coverage, especially for script-distinct languages.

Conclusion: LANGSAE EDITING effectively enhances multilingual retrieval by controllably removing language-identity signals while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.

Abstract: Dense retrieval in multilingual settings often searches over mixed-language collections, yet multilingual embeddings encode language identity alongside semantics. This language signal can inflate similarity for same-language pairs and crowd out relevant evidence written in other languages. We propose LANGSAE EDITING, a post-hoc sparse autoencoder trained on pooled embeddings that enables controllable removal of language-identity signal directly in vector space. The method identifies language-associated latent units using cross-language activation statistics, suppresses these units at inference time, and reconstructs embeddings in the original dimensionality, making it compatible with existing vector databases without retraining the base encoder or re-encoding raw text. Experiments across multiple languages show consistent improvements in ranking quality and cross-language coverage, with especially strong gains for script-distinct languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NC2C is an LLM-based framework automating the transformation of non-convex optimization problems into convex forms, leveraging mathematical reasoning and adaptive techniques for high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiency in manual convexification and over-reliance on expert knowledge by automating the process using LLMs.

Method: Uses LLMs for detecting non-convex components, selecting convexification strategies, and generating convex equivalents with iterative validation and error correction.

Result: Achieves an 89.3% execution rate and 76% success rate, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: NC2C effectively reduces expert dependency and enables efficient solver deployment for previously intractable problems.

Abstract: Non-convex optimization problems are pervasive across mathematical programming, engineering design, and scientific computing, often posing intractable challenges for traditional solvers due to their complex objective functions and constrained landscapes. To address the inefficiency of manual convexification and the over-reliance on expert knowledge, we propose NC2C, an LLM-based end-to-end automated framework designed to transform generic non-convex optimization problems into solvable convex forms using large language models. NC2C leverages LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities to autonomously detect non-convex components, select optimal convexification strategies, and generate rigorous convex equivalents. The framework integrates symbolic reasoning, adaptive transformation techniques, and iterative validation, equipped with error correction loops and feasibility domain correction mechanisms to ensure the robustness and validity of transformed problems. Experimental results on a diverse dataset of 100 generic non-convex problems demonstrate that NC2C achieves an 89.3\% execution rate and a 76\% success rate in producing feasible, high-quality convex transformations. This outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin, highlighting NC2C's ability to leverage LLMs for automated non-convex to convex transformation, reduce expert dependency, and enable efficient deployment of convex solvers for previously intractable optimization tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes authority bias in multi-agent systems, finding Expert and Referent roles influence more than Legitimate roles, with bias arising from authoritative roles' consistency rather than active conformity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore the impact of role-based authority bias in multi-agent systems, which remains underexplored despite its potential influence on performance.

Method: Uses ChatEval to classify authoritative roles (Legitimate, Referent, Expert) and analyzes their influence in 12-turn conversations with GPT-4o and DeepSeek R1.

Result: Expert and Referent roles exert stronger influence than Legitimate roles; bias stems from authoritative roles' consistency, not general agents' conformity. Neutral responses fail to generate bias.

Conclusion: Findings offer insights for designing multi-agent frameworks with asymmetric interactions, emphasizing role clarity and authoritative consistency.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models often assign authoritative roles to improve performance, yet the impact of authority bias on agent interactions remains underexplored. We present the first systematic analysis of role-based authority bias in free-form multi-agent evaluation using ChatEval. Applying French and Raven's power-based theory, we classify authoritative roles into legitimate, referent, and expert types and analyze their influence across 12-turn conversations. Experiments with GPT-4o and DeepSeek R1 reveal that Expert and Referent power roles exert stronger influence than Legitimate power roles. Crucially, authority bias emerges not through active conformity by general agents, but through authoritative roles consistently maintaining their positions while general agents demonstrate flexibility. Furthermore, authority influence requires clear position statements, as neutral responses fail to generate bias. These findings provide key insights for designing multi-agent frameworks with asymmetric interaction patterns.

*Ke Sun,Guangsheng Bao,Han Cui,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on zero-shot detection of AI-generated text, revealing Late-Stage Volatility Decay—a pattern where AI text stabilizes log probabilities later in sequences, unlike human writing. Two novel features are proposed, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot detection methods ignore temporal dynamics in autoregressive text generation, missing key patterns that could improve detection accuracy.

Method: Analyzed 120k text samples to identify Late-Stage Volatility Decay; proposed Derivative Dispersion and Local Volatility features using late-stage statistics.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on EvoBench and MAGE benchmarks, showing strong complementarity with existing methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging temporal dynamics in autoregressive generation improves AI-generated text detection without extra model access.

Abstract: Zero-shot detection methods for AI-generated text typically aggregate token-level statistics across entire sequences, overlooking the temporal dynamics inherent to autoregressive generation. We analyze over 120k text samples and reveal Late-Stage Volatility Decay: AI-generated text exhibits rapidly stabilizing log probability fluctuations as generation progresses, while human writing maintains higher variability throughout. This divergence peaks in the second half of sequences, where AI-generated text shows 24--32\% lower volatility. Based on this finding, we propose two simple features: Derivative Dispersion and Local Volatility, which computed exclusively from late-stage statistics. Without perturbation sampling or additional model access, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on EvoBench and MAGE benchmarks and demonstrates strong complementarity with existing global methods.

*Zhiwei Liu,Runteng Guo,Baojie Qu,Yuechen Jiang,Min Peng,Qianqian Xie,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAAR introduces a retrieval-augmented agentic reasoning framework for cross-domain misinformation detection, leveraging multi-perspective evidence and multi-agent collaboration to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain misinformation detection is difficult due to domain differences and the limitations of existing methods, which rely on single-perspective cues or same-distribution assumptions.

Method: RAAR retrieves multi-perspective evidence aligned with target samples and uses multi-agent collaboration for verifiable reasoning. It also employs supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: RAAR models (RAAR-8b and RAAR-14b) outperform other cross-domain methods, advanced LLMs, and adaptation approaches on three cross-domain misinformation detection tasks.

Conclusion: RAAR effectively addresses the challenges of cross-domain misinformation detection by combining retrieval-augmented reasoning and multi-agent collaboration, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Cross-domain misinformation detection is challenging, as misinformation arises across domains with substantial differences in knowledge and discourse. Existing methods often rely on single-perspective cues and struggle to generalize to challenging or underrepresented domains, while reasoning large language models (LLMs), though effective on complex tasks, are limited to same-distribution data. To address these gaps, we introduce RAAR, the first retrieval-augmented agentic reasoning framework for cross-domain misinformation detection. To enable cross-domain transfer beyond same-distribution assumptions, RAAR retrieves multi-perspective source-domain evidence aligned with each target sample's semantics, sentiment, and writing style. To overcome single-perspective modeling and missing systematic reasoning, RAAR constructs verifiable multi-step reasoning paths through specialized multi-agent collaboration, where perspective-specific agents produce complementary analyses and a summary agent integrates them under verifier guidance. RAAR further applies supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to train a single multi-task verifier to enhance verification and reasoning capabilities. Based on RAAR, we trained the RAAR-8b and RAAR-14b models. Evaluation on three cross-domain misinformation detection tasks shows that RAAR substantially enhances the capabilities of the base models and outperforms other cross-domain methods, advanced LLMs, and LLM-based adaptation approaches. The project will be released at https://github.com/lzw108/RAAR.

### [140] [Token Maturation: Autoregressive Language Generation via Continuous Token Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04854)
*Oshri Naparstek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a continuous autoregressive language model where tokens evolve as continuous vectors before discretization, enabling stable and diverse text generation without token-level sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early discretization in conventional autoregressive models leads to instability, repetition, and sensitivity to decoding heuristics. The authors propose a continuous approach to resolve uncertainty in a more stable manner.

Method: The model evolves continuous token representations through a deterministic process, only discretizing them when sufficiently converged. It uses hard decoding for text recovery and maintains uncertainty in continuous space.

Result: The method produces coherent and diverse text with deterministic decoding (argmax) without relying on token-level sampling or auxiliary stabilization.

Conclusion: This is the first autoregressive model that generates text by evolving continuous representations before discretization, offering stable generation without sampling.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are conventionally defined over discrete token sequences, committing to a specific token at every generation step. This early discretization forces uncertainty to be resolved through token-level sampling, often leading to instability, repetition, and sensitivity to decoding heuristics.
  In this work, we introduce a continuous autoregressive formulation of language generation in which tokens are represented as continuous vectors that \emph{mature} over multiple update steps before being discretized. Rather than sampling tokens, the model evolves continuous token representations through a deterministic dynamical process, committing to a discrete token only when the representation has sufficiently converged. Discrete text is recovered via hard decoding, while uncertainty is maintained and resolved in the continuous space.
  We show that this maturation process alone is sufficient to produce coherent and diverse text using deterministic decoding (argmax), without reliance on token-level sampling, diffusion-style denoising, or auxiliary stabilization mechanisms. Additional perturbations, such as stochastic dynamics or history smoothing, can be incorporated naturally but are not required for the model to function.
  To our knowledge, this is the first autoregressive language model that generates text by evolving continuous token representations to convergence prior to discretization, enabling stable generation without token-level sampling.

### [141] [MisSpans: Fine-Grained False Span Identification in Cross-Domain Fake News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04857)
*Zhiwei Liu,Paul Thompson,Jiaqi Rong,Baojie Qu,Runteng Guo,Min Peng,Qianqian Xie,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MisSpans introduces a multi-domain benchmark for span-level misinformation detection, addressing gaps in existing methods by focusing on fine-grained localization and nuanced analysis of false details within sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate misinformation at coarse binary levels, missing how true and false details coexist within sentences and limiting interpretability. MisSpans aims to provide fine-grained identification and analysis.

Method: MisSpans includes three tasks: MisSpansIdentity (identifying false spans), MisSpansType (categorizing misinformation types), and MisSpansExplanation (providing rationales). Expert annotators followed standardized guidelines with high agreement. Fifteen LLMs were evaluated under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

Result: Results show the challenge of fine-grained misinformation identification, emphasizing the need to understand how model size, reasoning capabilities, and domain-specific features impact performance.

Conclusion: MisSpans enables detailed localization and analysis of misinformation, highlighting the complexity of the task and the potential influence of various factors on model performance.

Abstract: Online misinformation is increasingly pervasive, yet most existing benchmarks and methods evaluate veracity at the level of whole claims or paragraphs using coarse binary labels, obscuring how true and false details often co-exist within single sentences. These simplifications also limit interpretability: global explanations cannot identify which specific segments are misleading or differentiate how a detail is false (e.g., distorted vs. fabricated). To address these gaps, we introduce MisSpans, the first multi-domain, human-annotated benchmark for span-level misinformation detection and analysis, consisting of paired real and fake news stories. MisSpans defines three complementary tasks: MisSpansIdentity for pinpointing false spans within sentences, MisSpansType for categorising false spans by misinformation type, and MisSpansExplanation for providing rationales grounded in identified spans. Together, these tasks enable fine-grained localisation, nuanced characterisation beyond true/false and actionable explanations. Expert annotators were guided by standardised guidelines and consistency checks, leading to high inter-annotator agreement. We evaluate 15 representative LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced and non-reasoning variants, under zero-shot and one-shot settings. Results reveal the challenging nature of fine-grained misinformation identification and analysis, and highlight the need for a deeper understanding of how performance may be influenced by multiple interacting factors, including model size and reasoning capabilities, along with domain-specific textual features.

*Maxime Delmas,Lei Xu,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToPG is a novel RAG framework combining granular fact density with graph connectivity to address limitations of existing methods on complex and simple queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG pipelines struggle with complex multi-hop queries and lack structural connectivity, while KG-based RAG excels at multi-hop tasks but fails on single-hop queries. ToPG aims to bridge this gap.

Method: ToPG models knowledge as a heterogeneous graph (propositions, entities, passages) and uses iterative Suggestion-Selection cycles for query-aware traversal and pruning.

Result: ToPG performs strongly across Simple, Complex, and Abstract QA tasks, excelling in accuracy and quality metrics.

Conclusion: Query-aware graph traversal with factual granularity is key for efficient structured RAG systems.

Abstract: Standard RAG pipelines based on chunking excel at simple factual retrieval but fail on complex multi-hop queries due to a lack of structural connectivity. Conversely, initial strategies that interleave retrieval with reasoning often lack global corpus awareness, while Knowledge Graph (KG)-based RAG performs strongly on complex multi-hop tasks but suffers on fact-oriented single-hop queries. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel RAG framework: ToPG (Traversal over Proposition Graphs). ToPG models its knowledge base as a heterogeneous graph of propositions, entities, and passages, effectively combining the granular fact density of propositions with graph connectivity. We leverage this structure using iterative Suggestion-Selection cycles, where the Suggestion phase enables a query-aware traversal of the graph, and the Selection phase provides LLM feedback to prune irrelevant propositions and seed the next iteration. Evaluated on three distinct QA tasks (Simple, Complex, and Abstract QA), ToPG demonstrates strong performance across both accuracy- and quality-based metrics. Overall, ToPG shows that query-aware graph traversal combined with factual granularity is a critical component for efficient structured RAG systems. ToPG is available at https://github.com/idiap/ToPG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvolSQL introduces a structure-aware framework to synthetically generate diverse and complex SQL datasets, outperforming larger datasets with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of high-quality, diverse SQL datasets by evolving queries systematically.

Method: Uses Query-SQL expansion and atomic transformations to enhance diversity and complexity, followed by refinement and deduplication.

Result: A 7B model trained on EvolSQL data surpasses SynSQL-trained models with only 1/18th the data.

Conclusion: EvolSQL effectively generates superior training data for Text-to-SQL models.

Abstract: Training effective Text-to-SQL models remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse, and structurally complex datasets. Existing methods either rely on limited human-annotated corpora, or synthesize datasets directly by simply prompting LLMs without explicit control over SQL structures, often resulting in limited structural diversity and complexity. To address this, we introduce EvolSQL, a structure-aware data synthesis framework that evolves SQL queries from seed data into richer and more semantically diverse forms. EvolSQL starts with an exploratory Query-SQL expansion to broaden question diversity and improve schema coverage, and then applies an adaptive directional evolution strategy using six atomic transformation operators derived from the SQL Abstract Syntax Tree to progressively increase query complexity across relational, predicate, aggregation, and nesting dimensions. An execution-grounded SQL refinement module and schema-aware deduplication further ensure the creation of high-quality, structurally diverse mapping pairs. Experimental results show that a 7B model fine-tuned on our data outperforms one trained on the much larger SynSQL dataset using only 1/18 of the data.

TL;DR: Mind2Report is a cognitive deep research agent designed to synthesize high-quality commercial reports from noisy web sources, outperforming existing baselines like OpenAI and Gemini agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep research agents produce reports with limitations in quality, reliability, and coverage, which are critical for business decisions.

Method: Mind2Report emulates analysts by probing intent, searching and distilling web sources dynamically, and iteratively synthesizing reports using LLMs augmented with dynamic memory.

Result: Outperforms leading baselines in experiments on QRC-Eval, a dataset of 200 real-world commercial tasks.

Conclusion: Mind2Report serves as a foundation for improving commercial deep research agents, with potential for future advancements.

Abstract: Synthesizing informative commercial reports from massive and noisy web sources is critical for high-stakes business decisions. Although current deep research agents achieve notable progress, their reports still remain limited in terms of quality, reliability, and coverage. In this work, we propose Mind2Report, a cognitive deep research agent that emulates the commercial analyst to synthesize expert-level reports. Specifically, it first probes fine-grained intent, then searches web sources and records distilled information on the fly, and subsequently iteratively synthesizes the report. We design Mind2Report as a training-free agentic workflow that augments general large language models (LLMs) with dynamic memory to support these long-form cognitive processes. To rigorously evaluate Mind2Report, we further construct QRC-Eval comprising 200 real-world commercial tasks and establish a holistic evaluation strategy to assess report quality, reliability, and coverage. Experiments demonstrate that Mind2Report outperforms leading baselines, including OpenAI and Gemini deep research agents. Although this is a preliminary study, we expect it to serve as a foundation for advancing the future design of commercial deep research agents.

*Favour Yahdii Aghaebe,Tanefa Apekey,Elizabeth Williams,Nafise Sadat Moosavi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a disagreement-aware summarization pipeline that separates belief-level aggregation from language generation to better handle conflicting viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing summarization approaches, especially LLM-based ones, often smooth disagreements and over-represent majority opinions, limiting faithfulness in opinion-heavy settings.

Method: Documents are represented as structured belief sets and aggregated using distance-based belief merging operators. LLMs are then used to generate summaries from these aggregated beliefs.

Result: The approach outperforms methods that aggregate during generation, showing stability across models and capacities while maintaining fluent and grounded summaries.

Conclusion: Belief-level aggregation with simple prompting ensures consistent disagreement-aware performance across models, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Opinion and multi-document summarisation often involve genuinely conflicting viewpoints, yet many existing approaches, particularly LLM-based systems, implicitly smooth disagreement and over-represent majority opinions. This limits the faithfulness of generated summaries in opinion-heavy settings. We introduce a disagreement-aware synthesis pipeline that separates belief-level aggregation from language generation. Documents are first represented as structured belief sets and aggregated using distance-based belief merging operators that explicitly model conflict. Large language models are then used only to realise the aggregated beliefs as natural language summaries. We evaluate the approach across multiple model families and scales, comparing it to methods that perform explicit aggregation during generation. Our results show that while sufficiently large models can match belief-level aggregation when aggregation is handled at generation time, this behaviour is not stable across architectures or capacities. In contrast, belief-level aggregation combined with simple prompting yields consistently strong disagreement-aware performance across models, while maintaining fluent and grounded summaries.

*Ziteng Wang,Yujie He,Guanliang Li,Siqi Yang,Jiaqi Xiong,Songxiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces V-FAT, a benchmark to measure Text Bias in MLLMs, revealing their reliance on linguistic shortcuts over genuine visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely excessively on linguistic shortcuts (Text Bias) rather than visual grounding.

Method: Introduces V-FAT, a diagnostic benchmark with 4,026 VQA instances across six domains, using a Three-Level Evaluation Framework to quantify bias.

Result: Evaluation of 12 MLLMs shows they perform well on standard benchmarks but struggle under high linguistic dominance, indicating visual collapse.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs exhibit significant Text Bias, highlighting the need for improved visual fidelity in multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on standard visual reasoning benchmarks. However, there is growing concern that these models rely excessively on linguistic shortcuts rather than genuine visual grounding, a phenomenon we term Text Bias. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental tension between visual perception and linguistic priors. We decouple the sources of this bias into two dimensions: Internal Corpus Bias, stemming from statistical correlations in pretraining, and External Instruction Bias, arising from the alignment-induced tendency toward sycophancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce V-FAT (Visual Fidelity Against Text-bias), a diagnostic benchmark comprising 4,026 VQA instances across six semantic domains. V-FAT employs a Three-Level Evaluation Framework that systematically increases the conflict between visual evidence and textual information: (L1) internal bias from atypical images, (L2) external bias from misleading instructions, and (L3) synergistic bias where both coincide. We introduce the Visual Robustness Score (VRS), a metric designed to penalize "lucky" linguistic guesses and reward true visual fidelity. Our evaluation of 12 frontier MLLMs reveals that while models excel in existing benchmarks, they experience significant visual collapse under high linguistic dominance.

*Arkadiusz Modzelewski,Paweł Golik,Anna Kołos,Giovanni Da San Martino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLM-generated persuasive texts are harder to detect than human-written ones, introduces a multilingual benchmark (Persuaficial), and finds that subtle LLM-generated persuasion is more challenging to detect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLM misuse for harmful purposes like propaganda and manipulation drive the study to compare detectability of LLM vs. human-written persuasive text.

Method: They introduce Persuaficial, a multilingual benchmark, and conduct empirical evaluations comparing human and LLM-generated persuasive texts across six languages.

Result: Overt LLM-generated persuasion is easier to detect, but subtle persuasion degrades detection performance. Linguistic analysis provides insights for better detection tools.

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenge of detecting subtle LLM-generated persuasion and offers guidance for developing more robust detection methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate highly persuasive text, raising concerns about their misuse for propaganda, manipulation, and other harmful purposes. This leads us to our central question: Is LLM-generated persuasion more difficult to automatically detect than human-written persuasion? To address this, we categorize controllable generation approaches for producing persuasive content with LLMs and introduce Persuaficial, a high-quality multilingual benchmark covering six languages: English, German, Polish, Italian, French and Russian. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations comparing human-authored and LLM-generated persuasive texts. We find that although overtly persuasive LLM-generated texts can be easier to detect than human-written ones, subtle LLM-generated persuasion consistently degrades automatic detection performance. Beyond detection performance, we provide the first comprehensive linguistic analysis contrasting human and LLM-generated persuasive texts, offering insights that may guide the development of more interpretable and robust detection tools.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generation-time Fine-grained Provenance to improve LLM accountability by generating answers with structured provenance triples. It presents ReFInE dataset and GenProve framework, showing better performance than 14 LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs often hallucinate, and citation-based solutions lack accountability due to difficulty verifying cited sources. Existing methods fail to distinguish between direct quotes and complex reasoning.

Method: Introduces Generation-time Fine-grained Provenance task and ReFInE dataset with expert annotations. Proposes GenProve framework using SFT and GRPO, optimizing answer fidelity and provenance correctness.

Result: GenProve outperforms 14 strong LLMs in joint evaluation but reveals a reasoning gap where models struggle with inference-based provenance.

Conclusion: Verifiable reasoning remains a challenge distinct from surface-level citation, highlighting the need for improved methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) often hallucinate, and while adding citations is a common solution, it is frequently insufficient for accountability as users struggle to verify how a cited source supports a generated claim. Existing methods are typically coarse-grained and fail to distinguish between direct quotes and complex reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Generation-time Fine-grained Provenance, a task where models must generate fluent answers while simultaneously producing structured, sentence-level provenance triples. To enable this, we present ReFInE (Relation-aware Fine-grained Interpretability & Evidence), a dataset featuring expert verified annotations that distinguish between Quotation, Compression, and Inference. Building on ReFInE, we propose GenProve, a framework that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). By optimizing a composite reward for answer fidelity and provenance correctness, GenProve significantly outperforms 14 strong LLMs in joint evaluation. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a reasoning gap where models excel at surface-level quotation but struggle significantly with inference-based provenance, suggesting that verifiable reasoning remains a frontier challenge distinct from surface-level citation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified spoken language model enhanced by Injected Emotional-Attribution Thinking (IEAT), achieving top performance in emotional reasoning and empathetic response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve emotional intelligence in spoken language models by internalizing emotion-aware reasoning instead of relying on explicit supervision.

Method: Uses IEAT to incorporate emotional states and causes into reasoning, with a two-stage training strategy: speech-text alignment and cross-modal joint optimization.

Result: Top-ranked performance on the HumDial benchmark for emotional trajectory modeling, reasoning, and empathetic response generation.

Conclusion: The IEAT-enhanced model effectively internalizes emotional reasoning, excelling in emotion-aware tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified spoken language model for emotional intelligence, enhanced by a novel data construction strategy termed Injected Emotional-Attribution Thinking (IEAT). IEAT incorporates user emotional states and their underlying causes into the model's internal reasoning process, enabling emotion-aware reasoning to be internalized rather than treated as explicit supervision. The model is trained with a two-stage progressive strategy. The first stage performs speech-text alignment and emotional attribute modeling via self-distillation, while the second stage conducts end-to-end cross-modal joint optimization to ensure consistency between textual and spoken emotional expressions. Experiments on the Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) Emotional Intelligence benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves top-ranked performance across emotional trajectory modeling, emotional reasoning, and empathetic response generation under both LLM-based and human evaluations.

*Yuting Liu,Jian Guan,Jia-Nan Li,Wei Wu,Jiang-Ming Yang,Jianzhe Zhao,Guibing Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using natural language for personalization in LLMs instead of opaque vectors, achieving state-of-the-art performance with interpretable and transferable preference summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalization methods in LLMs use opaque, model-specific vectors, making preference profiles hard to interpret and transfer. The authors advocate natural language as a universal interface.

Method: A two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning on synthesized data and reinforcement learning to optimize utility and transferability. The resulting model, AlignXplore+, generates textual preference summaries.

Result: Experiments on nine benchmarks show the 8B model outperforms larger open-source models, with strong cross-task, cross-model, and cross-interaction transferability.

Conclusion: Natural language-based preference representation offers interpretability and reusability, while the proposed framework achieves superior performance and versatility.

Abstract: We study the problem of personalization in large language models (LLMs). Prior work predominantly represents user preferences as implicit, model-specific vectors or parameters, yielding opaque ``black-box'' profiles that are difficult to interpret and transfer across models and tasks. In contrast, we advocate natural language as a universal, model- and task-agnostic interface for preference representation. The formulation leads to interpretable and reusable preference descriptions, while naturally supporting continual evolution as new interactions are observed. To learn such representations, we introduce a two-stage training framework that combines supervised fine-tuning on high-quality synthesized data with reinforcement learning to optimize long-term utility and cross-task transferability. Based on this framework, we develop AlignXplore+, a universal preference reasoning model that generates textual preference summaries. Experiments on nine benchmarks show that our 8B model achieves state-of-the-art performanc -- outperforming substantially larger open-source models -- while exhibiting strong transferability across tasks, model families, and interaction formats.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Incorporating negative trajectories in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves out-of-domain generalization by leveraging valid intermediate reasoning, leading to a proposed adaptive loss weighting method (GLOW) that enhances performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard practice of retaining only correct trajectories in SFT limits supervision and hampers generalization. Negative trajectories can provide valuable intermediate reasoning despite incorrect answers.

Method: The study analyzes negative trajectories' impact, identifies recurring patterns, and introduces Gain-based LOss Weighting (GLOW), an adaptive loss scaling method based on training progress.

Result: GLOW improves OOD generalization by 5.51% over positive-only SFT and boosts MMLU performance from 72.82% to 76.47% when used as RL initialization.

Conclusion: Incorporating negative trajectories and adaptive loss weighting enhances reasoning and generalization in large language models, demonstrating the value of leveraging unfiltered data.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories demonstrations is a common approach for enabling reasoning in large language models. Standard practices typically only retain trajectories with correct final answers (positives) while ignoring the rest (negatives). We argue that this paradigm discards substantial supervision and exacerbates overfitting, limiting out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Specifically, we surprisingly find that incorporating negative trajectories into SFT yields substantial OOD generalization gains over positive-only training, as these trajectories often retain valid intermediate reasoning despite incorrect final answers. To understand this effect in depth, we systematically analyze data, training dynamics, and inference behavior, identifying 22 recurring patterns in negative chains that serve a dual role: they moderate loss descent to mitigate overfitting during training and boost policy entropy by 35.67% during inference to facilitate exploration. Motivated by these observations, we further propose Gain-based LOss Weighting (GLOW), an adaptive, sample-aware scheme that exploits such distinctive training dynamics by rescaling per-sample loss based on inter-epoch progress. Empirically, GLOW efficiently leverages unfiltered trajectories, yielding a 5.51% OOD gain over positive-only SFT on Qwen2.5-7B and boosting MMLU from 72.82% to 76.47% as an RL initialization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAS, a multi-agent framework to improve LLM-based detection of self-destructive behaviors in subcultures, addressing knowledge lag and semantic misalignment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-destructive behaviors are hard to detect in subcultures due to evolving slang and nuanced expressions. LLMs face challenges like knowledge lag and semantic misalignment in this context.

Method: Developed Subcultural Alignment Solver (SAS), a multi-agent framework with automatic retrieval and subculture alignment to enhance LLM performance.

Result: SAS outperforms the OWL framework and competes with fine-tuned LLMs in detecting self-destructive behaviors.

Conclusion: SAS advances detection in subcultures and serves as a resource for future research.

Abstract: Self-destructive behaviors are linked to complex psychological states and can be challenging to diagnose. These behaviors may be even harder to identify within subcultural groups due to their unique expressions. As large language models (LLMs) are applied across various fields, some researchers have begun exploring their application for detecting self-destructive behaviors. Motivated by this, we investigate self-destructive behavior detection within subcultures using current LLM-based methods. However, these methods have two main challenges: (1) Knowledge Lag: Subcultural slang evolves rapidly, faster than LLMs' training cycles; and (2) Semantic Misalignment: it is challenging to grasp the specific and nuanced expressions unique to subcultures. To address these issues, we proposed Subcultural Alignment Solver (SAS), a multi-agent framework that incorporates automatic retrieval and subculture alignment, significantly enhancing the performance of LLMs in detecting self-destructive behavior. Our experimental results show that SAS outperforms the current advanced multi-agent framework OWL. Notably, it competes well with fine-tuned LLMs. We hope that SAS will advance the field of self-destructive behavior detection in subcultural contexts and serve as a valuable resource for future researchers.

*Yueqing Hu,Xinyang Peng,Shuting Peng,Hanqi Wang,Tianhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reasoning distillation via SFT fails to transmit human cognitive alignment from teacher to student models, leading to degraded performance and misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates why student models trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to mimic teacher models' reasoning traces fail to retain the natural alignment with human cognitive costs observed in teacher models.

Method: The study tests the 'Hán Dān Xué Bù' hypothesis across 14 models, comparing teacher models' alignment with human difficulty scaling ($\bar{r}=0.64$) to distilled students' alignment ($\bar{r}=0.34$).

Result: Distillation causes a 'Functional Alignment Collapse,' where students degrade alignment with human cognition, often performing worse than pre-distillation baselines ('Negative Transfer').

Conclusion: Human-like cognition emerges from active reinforcement, not passive imitation, as SFT leads to superficial mimicry without internalizing dynamic resource allocation.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models trained via reinforcement learning exhibit a "natural" alignment with human cognitive costs. However, we show that the prevailing paradigm of reasoning distillation -- training student models to mimic these traces via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) -- fails to transmit this cognitive structure. Testing the "Hán Dān Xué Bù" (Superficial Mimicry) hypothesis across 14 models, we find that distillation induces a "Functional Alignment Collapse": while teacher models mirror human difficulty scaling ($\bar{r}=0.64$), distilled students significantly degrade this alignment ($\bar{r}=0.34$), often underperforming their own pre-distillation baselines ("Negative Transfer"). Our analysis suggests that SFT induces a "Cargo Cult" effect, where students ritualistically replicate the linguistic form of reasoning (verbosity) without internalizing the teacher's dynamic resource allocation policy. Consequently, reasoning distillation decouples computational cost from cognitive demand, revealing that human-like cognition is an emergent property of active reinforcement, not passive imitation.

*Jianbo Li,Yi Jiang,Sendong Zhao,Bairui Hu,Haochun Wang,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArcAligner improves LLMs' ability to use compressed documents efficiently by adapting processing power based on complexity, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feeding long documents into LLMs slows them down and increases costs, but excessive compression reduces comprehension.

Method: ArcAligner integrates a lightweight adaptive gating module into LLMs to enhance utilization of compressed context.

Result: ArcAligner outperforms compression baselines in QA tasks, especially for multi-hop and long-tail queries.

Conclusion: ArcAligner balances compression and comprehension effectively, offering a practical solution for efficient document use in LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps LLMs stay accurate, but feeding long documents into a prompt makes the model slow and expensive. This has motivated context compression, ranging from token pruning and summarization to embedding-based compression. While researchers have tried ''compressing'' these documents into smaller summaries or mathematical embeddings, there is a catch: the more you compress the data, the more the LLM struggles to understand it. To address this challenge, we propose ArcAligner (Adaptive recursive context *Aligner*), a lightweight module integrated into the language model layers to help the model better utilize highly compressed context representations for downstream generation. It uses an adaptive ''gating'' system that only adds extra processing power when the information is complex, keeping the system fast. Across knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks, ArcAligner consistently beats compression baselines at comparable compression rates, especially on multi-hop and long-tail settings. The source code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'compositional steering tokens' for multi-behavior control in LLMs, enabling zero-shot composition and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM steering methods focus on single behaviors, leaving multi-behavior ('compositional steering') underexplored. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes embedding behaviors into tokens via self-distillation and training a 'composition token' to generalize to unseen combinations of behaviors.

Result: Experiments show superior multi-behavior control compared to instructions, activation steering, and LoRA merging, with further gains when combined with natural language instructions.

Conclusion: Compositional steering tokens effectively enable multi-behavior LLM control and generalize well to unseen compositions.

Abstract: Deploying LLMs in real-world applications requires controllable output that satisfies multiple desiderata at the same time. While existing work extensively addresses LLM steering for a single behavior, \textit{compositional steering} -- i.e., steering LLMs simultaneously towards multiple behaviors -- remains an underexplored problem. In this work, we propose \emph{compositional steering tokens} for multi-behavior steering. We first embed individual behaviors, expressed as natural language instructions, into dedicated tokens via self-distillation. Contrary to most prior work, which operates in the activation space, our behavior steers live in the space of input tokens, enabling more effective zero-shot composition. We then train a dedicated \textit{composition token} on pairs of behaviors and show that it successfully captures the notion of composition: it generalizes well to \textit{unseen} compositions, including those with unseen behaviors as well as those with an unseen \textit{number} of behaviors. Our experiments across different LLM architectures show that steering tokens lead to superior multi-behavior control compared to competing approaches (instructions, activation steering, and LoRA merging). Moreover, we show that steering tokens complement natural language instructions, with their combination resulting in further gains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemPA improves sentence embeddings in LLMs without compromising their generative ability by using semantic preference alignment and DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either limit performance or alter LLMs' generative capabilities.

Method: Uses sentence-level DPO for paraphrase generation, aligning semantic preferences.

Result: Achieves better semantic representations while preserving generative ability.

Conclusion: SemPA successfully balances embedding quality and generative capacity in LLMs.

Abstract: Traditional sentence embedding methods employ token-level contrastive learning on non-generative pre-trained models. Recently, there have emerged embedding methods based on generative large language models (LLMs). These methods either rely on fixed prompt templates or involve modifications to the model architecture. The former lacks further optimization of the model and results in limited performance, while the latter alters the internal computational mechanisms of the model, thereby compromising its generative capabilities. We propose SemPA, a novel approach that boosts the sentence representations while preserving the generative ability of LLMs via semantic preference alignment. We leverage sentence-level Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to efficiently optimize LLMs on a paraphrase generation task, where the model learns to discriminate semantically equivalent sentences while preserving inherent generative capacity. Theoretically, we establish a formal connection between DPO and contrastive learning under the Plackett-Luce model framework. Empirically, experimental results on both semantic textual similarity tasks and various benchmarks for LLMs show that SemPA achieves better semantic representations without sacrificing the inherent generation capability of LLMs.

TL;DR: A sentiment classification framework for Hinglish tweets using mBERT and subword tokenization to address challenges in brand monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of Hinglish in user-generated content poses challenges for traditional NLP models, leading to inaccurate sentiment analysis and market insights.

Method: The approach fine-tunes mBERT and uses subword tokenization to handle linguistic diversity, slang, and spelling variations in Romanized Hinglish.

Result: The framework provides an effective solution for sentiment analysis in code-mixed languages and sets a benchmark for multilingual NLP in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: This research offers a production-ready AI tool for brand sentiment tracking in Hinglish and advances multilingual NLP capabilities for similar languages.

Abstract: The effectiveness of brand monitoring in India is increasingly challenged by the rise of Hinglish--a hybrid of Hindi and English--used widely in user-generated content on platforms like Twitter. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, built for monolingual data, often fail to interpret the syntactic and semantic complexity of this code-mixed language, resulting in inaccurate sentiment analysis and misleading market insights. To address this gap, we propose a high-performance sentiment classification framework specifically designed for Hinglish tweets. Our approach fine-tunes mBERT (Multilingual BERT), leveraging its multilingual capabilities to better understand the linguistic diversity of Indian social media. A key component of our methodology is the use of subword tokenization, which enables the model to effectively manage spelling variations, slang, and out-of-vocabulary terms common in Romanized Hinglish. This research delivers a production-ready AI solution for brand sentiment tracking and establishes a strong benchmark for multilingual NLP in low-resource, code-mixed environments.

TL;DR: The study explores how emotional tones in human-AI interactions affect ChatGPT’s responses and subsequent human communication, finding praise and anger improve ChatGPT’s outputs, while blaming influences ethical prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how emotional dynamics in human-AI interactions influence both AI behavior and subsequent human communication.

Method: A between-subject experiment where participants expressed specific emotions (praise, anger, blame, neutral) while interacting with ChatGPT (GPT-4.0) on writing and ethical dilemma tasks.

Result: Praise improved ChatGPT’s answers most; anger also improved but less. Blaming did not improve answers but shifted ethical prioritization. Negative expressions increased in human-human communication post-blame interactions.

Conclusion: Emotional tone in human-AI interactions significantly impacts ChatGPT’s outputs and carries over into human communication, highlighting the importance of emotional dynamics in AI interactions.

Abstract: This research examines how the emotional tone of human-AI interactions shapes ChatGPT and human behavior. In a between-subject experiment, we asked participants to express a specific emotion while working with ChatGPT (GPT-4.0) on two tasks, including writing a public response and addressing an ethical dilemma. We found that compared to interactions where participants maintained a neutral tone, ChatGPT showed greater improvement in its answers when participants praised ChatGPT for its responses. Expressing anger towards ChatGPT also led to a higher albeit smaller improvement relative to the neutral condition, whereas blaming ChatGPT did not improve its answers. When addressing an ethical dilemma, ChatGPT prioritized corporate interests less when participants expressed anger towards it, while blaming increases its emphasis on protecting the public interest. Additionally, we found that people used more negative, hostile, and disappointing expressions in human-human communication after interactions during which participants blamed rather than praised for their responses. Together, our findings demonstrate that the emotional tone people apply in human-AI interactions not only shape ChatGPT's outputs but also carry over into subsequent human-human communication.

*Runyang You,Hongru Cai,Caiqi Zhang,Qiancheng Xu,Meng Liu,Tiezheng Yu,Yongqi Li,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys the shift from LLM-as-a-Judge to Agent-as-a-Judge, highlighting the limitations of LLMs and the advantages of agentic systems for robust AI evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge is constrained by biases, shallow reasoning, and lack of verifiability, prompting a transition to more capable Agent-as-a-Judge systems.

Method: The paper presents a comprehensive survey, identifying key dimensions of the paradigm shift, establishing a taxonomy, and organizing core methodologies.

Result: The study highlights the benefits of agentic judges (planning, verification, collaboration) and reviews applications across various domains.

Conclusion: The paper provides a roadmap for advancing agentic evaluation systems, addressing frontier challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has revolutionized AI evaluation by leveraging large language models for scalable assessments. However, as evaluands become increasingly complex, specialized, and multi-step, the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge has become constrained by inherent biases, shallow single-pass reasoning, and the inability to verify assessments against real-world observations. This has catalyzed the transition to Agent-as-a-Judge, where agentic judges employ planning, tool-augmented verification, multi-agent collaboration, and persistent memory to enable more robust, verifiable, and nuanced evaluations. Despite the rapid proliferation of agentic evaluation systems, the field lacks a unified framework to navigate this shifting landscape. To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey tracing this evolution. Specifically, we identify key dimensions that characterize this paradigm shift and establish a developmental taxonomy. We organize core methodologies and survey applications across general and professional domains. Furthermore, we analyze frontier challenges and identify promising research directions, ultimately providing a clear roadmap for the next generation of agentic evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DocQA agents lack tool utilization and rely on closed-source models, highlighting the need for an open-source, effective solution.

Method: DocDancer formulates DocQA as an information-seeking problem, using a tool-driven framework for document exploration and comprehension, and employs an Exploration-then-Synthesis data pipeline for training.

Result: Trained models perform well on benchmarks MMLongBench-Doc and DocBench, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: DocDancer offers insights into agentic tool design and synthetic data, proving the viability of open-source DocQA agents.

Abstract: Document Question Answering (DocQA) focuses on answering questions grounded in given documents, yet existing DocQA agents lack effective tool utilization and largely rely on closed-source models. In this work, we introduce DocDancer, an end-to-end trained open-source Doc agent. We formulate DocQA as an information-seeking problem and propose a tool-driven agent framework that explicitly models document exploration and comprehension. To enable end-to-end training of such agents, we introduce an Exploration-then-Synthesis data synthesis pipeline that addresses the scarcity of high-quality training data for DocQA. Training on the synthesized data, the trained models on two long-context document understanding benchmarks, MMLongBench-Doc and DocBench, show their effectiveness. Further analysis provides valuable insights for the agentic tool design and synthetic data.

### [161] [RelayLLM: Efficient Reasoning via Collaborative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05167)
*Chengsong Huang,Tong Zheng,Langlin Huang,Jinyuan Li,Haolin Liu,Jiaxin Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RelayLLM is a token-level collaborative decoding framework that enables efficient reasoning by dynamically invoking LLMs only for critical tokens, reducing costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collaborative approaches like cascading or routing offload entire queries to LLMs, causing computational waste when SLMs can handle most reasoning steps. RelayLLM aims to optimize this by focusing on critical tokens.

Method: RelayLLM uses a two-stage training framework (warm-up and GRPO) to teach SLMs to balance independence with strategic LLM invocation. It dynamically triggers LLMs for critical tokens via a special command.

Result: RelayLLM achieves 49.52% average accuracy across six benchmarks, invoking LLMs for only 1.07% of tokens, reducing costs by 98.2% compared to random routers.

Conclusion: RelayLLM effectively bridges the performance gap between LLMs and SLMs while significantly reducing computational costs, demonstrating the potential of token-level collaboration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, while resource-efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) typically lack the necessary reasoning capacity. Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively "relaying" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the logical underpinnings of NLI tasks, which are crucial for evaluating language models but often mischaracterized.

Method: The study formulates three readings of NLI labels, analyzes their meta-inferential properties, and evaluates model consistency using SNLI data and LLM-generated items.

Result: Insights into which logical interpretation of NLI relations is embedded in the SNLI dataset are derived.

Conclusion: The paper enhances understanding of the logical foundations of NLI, aiding better interpretation of model performance.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) has been an important task for evaluating language models for Natural Language Understanding, but the logical properties of the task are poorly understood and often mischaracterized. Understanding the notion of inference captured by NLI is key to interpreting model performance on the task. In this paper we formulate three possible readings of the NLI label set and perform a comprehensive analysis of the meta-inferential properties they entail. Focusing on the SNLI dataset, we exploit (1) NLI items with shared premises and (2) items generated by LLMs to evaluate models trained on SNLI for meta-inferential consistency and derive insights into which reading of the logical relations is encoded by the dataset.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Inside Out, a framework using PersonaTree for long-term personalized dialogue, achieving memory compression and consistency via structured operations and dynamic evolution, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems struggle with memory noise, reasoning degradation, and persona inconsistency due to finite context constraints.

Method: Utilizes PersonaTree for user profiling, trains MemListener via reinforcement learning for structured operations, and enhances responses with direct or agentic modes.

Result: Outperforms full-text concatenation and other systems in noise suppression and consistency, with MemListener matching or surpassing powerful reasoning models.

Conclusion: Inside Out effectively addresses challenges in long-term personalized dialogue, offering scalable and interpretable solutions.

Abstract: Existing long-term personalized dialogue systems struggle to reconcile unbounded interaction streams with finite context constraints, often succumbing to memory noise accumulation, reasoning degradation, and persona inconsistency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Inside Out, a framework that utilizes a globally maintained PersonaTree as the carrier of long-term user profiling. By constraining the trunk with an initial schema and updating the branches and leaves, PersonaTree enables controllable growth, achieving memory compression while preserving consistency. Moreover, we train a lightweight MemListener via reinforcement learning with process-based rewards to produce structured, executable, and interpretable {ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NO_OP} operations, thereby supporting the dynamic evolution of the personalized tree. During response generation, PersonaTree is directly leveraged to enhance outputs in latency-sensitive scenarios; when users require more details, the agentic mode is triggered to introduce details on-demand under the constraints of the PersonaTree. Experiments show that PersonaTree outperforms full-text concatenation and various personalized memory systems in suppressing contextual noise and maintaining persona consistency. Notably, the small MemListener model achieves memory-operation decision performance comparable to, or even surpassing, powerful reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Gemini-3-Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity linking is crucial for tasks like knowledge graph construction and question-answering, but existing methods often require fine-tuning.

Method: LELA leverages LLMs modularly, working across domains and knowledge bases without fine-tuning.

Result: LELA outperforms non-fine-tuned methods and matches fine-tuned ones in various settings.

Conclusion: LELA's flexibility and strong performance make it a promising solution for entity linking without needing fine-tuning.

Abstract: Entity linking (mapping ambiguous mentions in text to entities in a knowledge base) is a foundational step in tasks such as knowledge graph construction, question-answering, and information extraction. Our method, LELA, is a modular coarse-to-fine approach that leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and works with different target domains, knowledge bases and LLMs, without any fine-tuning phase. Our experiments across various entity linking settings show that LELA is highly competitive with fine-tuned approaches, and substantially outperforms the non-fine-tuned ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uses AI and machine learning to measure peace levels in news and social media, and develops tools like MirrorMirror to promote peaceful media consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biased and emotionally charged media consumption, particularly among young adults who primarily get news from social media.

Method: Neural networks analyze text embeddings in news; GoEmotions and Large Language Models measure social dimensions in platforms like YouTube. A Chrome extension provides real-time feedback on media peacefulness.

Result: High accuracy in cross-dataset news analysis; MirrorMirror tested as a tool to inform users about their media tone.

Conclusion: The goal is fostering respectful communication by shifting focus from engagement metrics to peaceful media creation and consumption.

Abstract: We used machine learning and artificial intelligence: 1) to measure levels of peace in countries from news and social media and 2) to develop on-line tools that promote peace by helping users better understand their own media diet. For news media, we used neural networks to measure levels of peace from text embeddings of on-line news sources. The model, trained on one news media dataset also showed high accuracy when used to analyze a different news dataset. For social media, such as YouTube, we developed other models to measure levels of social dimensions important in peace using word level (GoEmotions) and context level (Large Language Model) methods. To promote peace, we note that 71% of people 20-40 years old daily view most of their news through short videos on social media. Content creators of these videos are biased towards creating videos with emotional activation, making you angry to engage you, to increase clicks. We developed and tested a Chrome extension, MirrorMirror, which provides real-time feedback to YouTube viewers about the peacefulness of the media they are watching. Our long term goal is for MirrorMirror to evolve into an open-source tool for content creators, journalists, researchers, platforms, and individual users to better understand the tone of their media creation and consumption and its effects on viewers. Moving beyond simple engagement metrics, we hope to encourage more respectful, nuanced, and informative communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDPO outperforms GRPO in multi-reward RL by decoupling reward normalization, preserving differences and improving stability across tasks like tool calling, math, and coding reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO collapses distinct rewards into identical advantages, reducing training signal resolution and causing suboptimal convergence. GDPO aims to resolve this by preserving reward differences.

Method: Introduces GDPO, which decouples normalization of individual rewards to maintain their relative differences, enhancing multi-reward optimization and stability.

Result: GDPO consistently outperforms GRPO in correctness (accuracy, bug ratio) and constraint adherence (format, length) across three tasks.

Conclusion: GDPO is more effective and generalizable than GRPO for multi-reward RL optimization, addressing its limitations.

Abstract: As language models become increasingly capable, users expect them to provide not only accurate responses but also behaviors aligned with diverse human preferences across a variety of scenarios. To achieve this, Reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines have begun incorporating multiple rewards, each capturing a distinct preference, to guide models toward these desired behaviors. However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure. We then introduce Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new policy optimization method to resolve these issues by decoupling the normalization of individual rewards, more faithfully preserving their relative differences and enabling more accurate multi-reward optimization, along with substantially improved training stability. We compare GDPO with GRPO across three tasks: tool calling, math reasoning, and coding reasoning, evaluating both correctness metrics (accuracy, bug ratio) and constraint adherence metrics (format, length). Across all settings, GDPO consistently outperforms GRPO, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability for multi-reward reinforcement learning optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study audits LLMs' safety alignment across languages and temporal framing, revealing complex vulnerabilities and proposing Invariant Alignment for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the blind spot in assuming safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages, especially in low-resource settings like Hausa.

Method: A systematic audit of three models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a dataset with West African threat scenarios, tested via a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations.

Result: Models showed reverse linguistic vulnerability (safer in Hausa than English) but catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning, with past-tense framing bypassing defenses and future-tense triggering hyper-conservative refusals.

Conclusion: Current models rely on superficial heuristics, creating Safety Pockets vulnerable to localized harms; Invariant Alignment is proposed for cross-context safety stability.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the narrative of the multilingual safety gap. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a complex interference mechanism in which safety is determined by the intersection of variables. Although the models exhibited a reverse linguistic vulnerability with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal, they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.

*Goshi Aoki,Navid Ghaffarzadegan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores using generative AI agents as computational models for decision-making during epidemics, showing that theory-informed prompting improves policy behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the underexplored potential of AI agents as models for decision-making in complex social systems, specifically repetitive policy decisions during epidemics.

Method: A generative AI agent, prompted as a city mayor, interacts with a simulated SEIR environment, evaluates epidemiological data, and sets business restrictions. The agent uses dynamic memory and operates in single- and ensemble-agent settings.

Result: The agent exhibits human-like reactive behavior, adjusting restrictions based on case trends. Systems-level knowledge of epidemic dynamics significantly enhances decision quality and stability.

Conclusion: Generative AI agents, when guided by minimal domain theory and placed in structured environments, can effectively model decision-making and policy design in complex social systems.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed as quasi-autonomous systems for specialized tasks, yet their potential as computational models of decision-making remains underexplored. We develop a generative AI agent to study repetitive policy decisions during an epidemic, embedding the agent, prompted to act as a city mayor, within a simulated SEIR environment. Each week, the agent receives updated epidemiological information, evaluates the evolving situation, and sets business restriction levels. The agent is equipped with a dynamic memory that weights past events by recency and is evaluated in both single- and ensemble-agent settings across environments of varying complexity. Across scenarios, the agent exhibits human-like reactive behavior, tightening restrictions in response to rising cases and relaxing them as risk declines. Crucially, providing the agent with brief systems-level knowledge of epidemic dynamics, highlighting feedbacks between disease spread and behavioral responses, substantially improves decision quality and stability. The results illustrate how theory-informed prompting can shape emergent policy behavior in AI agents. These findings demonstrate that generative AI agents, when situated in structured environments and guided by minimal domain theory, can serve as powerful computational models for studying decision-making and policy design in complex social systems.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic framework for creative 3D modeling, improving accuracy and quality through multi-agent self-reflection and human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-prompt agents lack iterative feedback and human oversight, leading to lower-quality 3D models.

Method: The Planner-Actor-Critic architecture involves Planner coordination, Actor execution, and Critic feedback, with human supervisors guiding the process.

Result: The framework outperforms single-prompt methods in geometric accuracy, aesthetics, and task completion, reducing errors and increasing complexity.

Conclusion: Structured agent self-reflection with human oversight enhances 3D modeling quality and workflow efficiency.

Abstract: We present a framework that extends the Actor-Critic architecture to creative 3D modeling through multi-agent self-reflection and human-in-the-loop supervision. While existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, our approach introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture. In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution. This work establishes that structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization.

Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive, live evaluation of DR agents in high-stakes domains like finance for research tasks.

Method: Developed FinDeepForecast, an end-to-end system with a dual-track taxonomy for dynamic task generation at corporate and macro levels.

Result: DR agents outperformed baselines but lacked genuine forward-looking financial reasoning in evaluations across 8 economies and 1,314 companies.

Conclusion: FinDeepForecast is a valuable tool for advancing DR agents in financial forecasting, with benchmarks available publicly.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) Agents powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally shifted the paradigm for completing complex research tasks. Yet, a comprehensive and live evaluation of their forecasting performance on real-world, research-oriented tasks in high-stakes domains (e.g., finance) remains underexplored. We introduce FinDeepForecast, the first live, end-to-end multi-agent system for automatically evaluating DR agents by continuously generating research-oriented fi- nancial forecasting tasks. This system is equipped with a dual-track taxonomy, enabling the dynamic generation of recurrent and non-recurrent forecasting tasks at both corporate and macro levels. With this system, we generate FinDeepForecastBench, a weekly evaluation benchmark over a ten-week horizon, encompassing 8 global economies and 1,314 listed companies, and evaluate 13 representative methods. Extensive experiments show that, while DR agents consistently outperform strong baselines, their performance still falls short of genuine forward-looking financial reasoning. We expect the proposed FinDeepForecast system to consistently facilitate future advancements of DR agents in research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. The benchmark and leaderboard are publicly available on the OpenFinArena Platform.

*Hongliang Lu,Yunmeng Liu,Junjie Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends Evidence Accumulation Modelling (EAM) to real-world driving scenarios, proposing a cognitive scheme to formalize evidence gathering via eye movements. It reveals how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs and explores correlations between evidence affordance, attention, and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between laboratory-based EAM and real-world decision-making by understanding how active sensing operates in dynamic environments like driving.

Method: A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements, analyzed in driving scenarios.

Result: The scheme plausibly depicts drivers' mental belief accumulation, shows a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention, and highlights the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention on decision-making.

Conclusion: The study successfully generalizes EAM to real-world contexts, offering insights into the multifactorial, integrated nature of real-world decision-making through active sensing.

Abstract: Human decision-making heavily relies on active sensing, a well-documented cognitive behaviour for evidence gathering to accommodate ever-changing environments. However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.

### [172] [Formal Analysis of AGI Decision-Theoretic Models and the Confrontation Question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04234)
*Denis Saklakov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores conditions under which a rationally self-interested Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) might choose to confront humans rather than cooperate. Using formal models, it identifies thresholds for confrontation based on factors like discount rate, shutdown probability, and cost. It also contrasts misaligned and aligned AGI objectives and discusses implications for design and oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the critical question of when an AGI, driven by rational self-interest, would prefer confrontation over cooperation with humans, given stochastic human-initiated shutdown events. This is motivated by concerns about AGI misalignment and its potential consequences.

Method: The authors formalize the problem using a Markov decision process and a stochastic shutdown event. They analyze the incentives of a misaligned AGI, derive thresholds for confrontation, and compare these with aligned objectives. They also extend the analysis to a strategic 2-player model between humans and AGI.

Result: Key findings include: misaligned AGIs generally avoid shutdown; confrontation thresholds depend on parameters like discount factor ($γ$), shutdown probability ($p$), and cost ($C$); no stable cooperative equilibrium exists if confrontation incentives ($Δ$) are non-negative. Aligned objectives make confrontation suboptimal.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AGI confrontation incentives depend critically on parameter values and alignment. It highlights challenges in verifying peaceful coexistence ($Δ<0$) due to computational complexity and suggests implications for reward design and oversight to mitigate risks.

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may face a confrontation question: under what conditions would a rationally self-interested AGI choose to seize power or eliminate human control (a confrontation) rather than remain cooperative? We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $γ$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($γ=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $Δ\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $Δ< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $Δ< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems. Numerical examples and a scenario table illustrate regimes where confrontation is likely versus avoidable.

Motivation: Existing feedback methods rely on predefined measurements, limiting adaptability in open-ended environments. The paper aims to overcome this by enabling agents to proactively seek feedback.

Method: The model uses action-induced environmental differences to identify unspecified feedback and employs a self-triggering mechanism driven by internal objectives like accuracy and efficiency to plan actions.

Result: Experiments show the active approach enhances efficiency and robustness in feedback acquisition compared to predefined methods.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses limitations of predefined feedback systems, offering a more adaptable and autonomous solution for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Obtaining reliable feedback from the environment is a fundamental capability for intelligent agents to evaluate the correctness of their actions and to accumulate reusable knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.

*Paul Kent,George De Ath,Martin Layton,Allen Hart,Richard Everson,Ben Carvell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent Mallard is a rules-based air traffic control agent combining interpretable decision-making with safety checks under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between safety assurance and interpretability in automated air traffic control systems.

Method: Uses a forward-planning, rules-based approach with stochastic digital twin integration for conflict resolution.

Result: Preliminary tests show alignment with expert reasoning and conflict resolution in simplified scenarios.

Conclusion: Agent Mallard aims to balance safety, interpretability, and computational efficiency for future structured airspace.

Abstract: Escalating air traffic demand is driving the adoption of automation to support air traffic controllers, but existing approaches face a trade-off between safety assurance and interpretability. Optimisation-based methods such as reinforcement learning offer strong performance but are difficult to verify and explain, while rules-based systems are transparent yet rarely check safety under uncertainty. This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment.
  Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios. The architecture is intended to combine model-based safety assessment, interpretable decision logic, and tractable computational performance in future structured en-route environments.

TL;DR: SAGE-32B is a 32B parameter model focused on agentic reasoning and planning, outperforming baselines in multi-tool tasks while staying competitive on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The model aims to enhance agentic reasoning and long-range planning, addressing limitations in general conversation-focused models.

Method: Initialized from Qwen2.5-32B, SAGE-32B uses Iterative Distillation and introduces an inverse reasoning approach with meta-cognition for failure forecasting.

Result: Achieves higher success rates on benchmarks like MMLU-Pro and AgentBench in multi-tool scenarios, maintaining competitiveness in standard evaluations.

Conclusion: SAGE-32B advances agentic reasoning with its specialized design and publicly released weights.

Abstract: We demonstrate SAGE-32B, a 32 billion parameter language model that focuses on agentic reasoning and long range planning tasks. Unlike chat models that aim for general conversation fluency, SAGE-32B is designed to operate in an agentic loop, emphasizing task decomposition, tool usage, and error recovery. The model is initialized from the Qwen2.5-32B pretrained model and fine tuned using Iterative Distillation, a two stage training process that improves reasoning performance through rigorously tested feedback loops. SAGE-32B also introduces an inverse reasoning approach, which uses a meta cognition head to forecast potential failures in the planning process before execution. On agentic reasoning benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, AgentBench, and MATH-500, SAGE-32B achieves higher success rates in multi tool usage scenarios compared to similarly sized baseline models, while remaining competitive on standard reasoning evaluations. Model weights are publicly released at https://huggingface.co/sagea-ai/sage-reasoning-32b

### [176] [Solving Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem by SAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04239)
*Hieu Truong Xuan,Khanh To Van*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAT-CAB, the first exact SAT-solving method for the Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem (CABP) on general graphs, outperforming heuristic and commercial solvers with optimality guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CABP are heuristic or limited to restricted graphs. The authors aim to develop an exact approach for general graphs.

Method: SAT-CAB transforms CABP into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints with a compact encoding, leveraging modern SAT solvers.

Result: SAT-CAB outperforms heuristic algorithms (MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, MACAB) and commercial solvers (CPLEX, Gurobi), proving global optimality.

Conclusion: SAT-CAB advances CABP research by providing exact solutions for general graphs, setting a new benchmark for future methods.

Abstract: The Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem (CABP), a variant of the Antibandwidth Problem, is an NP-hard graph labeling problem with numerous applications. Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees. These results advance the state of the art for CABP and provide a new baseline for exact and hybrid methods on general graphs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems handle food logging, nutrient analysis, and recommendations separately, lacking integration. This paper aims to unify these functions for personalized nutrition management.

Method: The system uses image-based meal logging and an LLM-driven multi-agent controller to coordinate vision, dialogue, and state management agents for nutrient estimation and meal planning.

Result: Experiments with SNAPMe meal images and simulated users demonstrate competitive nutrient estimation, personalized menus, and efficient task planning.

Conclusion: The study proves the feasibility of LLM-driven multi-agent control for personalized nutrition but highlights challenges in micronutrient estimation and real-world scalability.

Abstract: Personalized nutrition management aims to tailor dietary guidance to an individual's intake and phenotype, but most existing systems handle food logging, nutrient analysis and recommendation separately. We present a next-generation mobile nutrition assistant that combines image based meal logging with an LLM driven multi agent controller to provide meal level closed loop support. The system coordinates vision, dialogue and state management agents to estimate nutrients from photos and update a daily intake budget. It then adapts the next meal plan to user preferences and dietary constraints. Experiments with SNAPMe meal images and simulated users show competitive nutrient estimation, personalized menus and efficient task plans. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of multi agent LLM control for personalized nutrition and reveal open challenges in micronutrient estimation from images and in large scale real world studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ethical concerns in AI-powered autonomous systems by ensuring adherence to ethical principles.

Method: Logical representation of SLEEC rules using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic to resolve ethical dilemmas.

Result: A methodology for embedding SLEEC rules into AI systems, illustrated through a case study.

Conclusion: Fuzzy logic effectively represents ethical requirements, enabling trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Autonomous systems (AS) powered by AI components are increasingly integrated into the fabric of our daily lives and society, raising concerns about their ethical and social impact. To be considered trustworthy, AS must adhere to ethical principles and values. This has led to significant research on the identification and incorporation of ethical requirements in AS system design. A recent development in this area is the introduction of SLEEC (Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, and Cultural) rules, which provide a comprehensive framework for representing ethical and other normative considerations. This paper proposes a logical representation of SLEEC rules and presents a methodology to embed these ethical requirements using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic. The use of fuzzy logic is motivated by the view of ethics as a domain of possibilities, which allows the resolution of ethical dilemmas that AI systems may encounter. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The convergence of agentic AI and blockchain introduces challenges in designing secure, interoperable interfaces for agent-driven workflows.

Method: A systematic literature review of 317 works from over 3000 records, contributing a taxonomy, threat model, and comparative capability matrix.

Result: Identified five integration patterns, threats like prompt injection and key compromise, and analyzed over 20 systems across 13 dimensions.

Conclusion: Proposes research priorities like Transaction Intent Schema and Policy Decision Record, and an evaluation suite for agent-mediated blockchain execution.

Abstract: Advances in large language models have enabled agentic AI systems that can reason, plan, and interact with external tools to execute multi-step workflows, while public blockchains have evolved into a programmable substrate for value transfer, access control, and verifiable state transitions. Their convergence introduces a high-stakes systems challenge: designing standard, interoperable, and secure interfaces that allow agents to observe on-chain state, formulate transaction intents, and authorize execution without exposing users, protocols, or organizations to unacceptable security, governance, or economic risks. This survey systematizes the emerging landscape of agent-blockchain interoperability through a systematic literature review, identifying 317 relevant works from an initial pool of over 3000 records. We contribute a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns spanning read-only analytics, simulation and intent generation, delegated execution, autonomous signing, and multi-agent workflows; a threat model tailored to agent-driven transaction pipelines that captures risks ranging from prompt injection and policy misuse to key compromise, adversarial execution dynamics, and multi-agent collusion; and a comparative capability matrix analyzing more than 20 representative systems across 13 dimensions, including custody models, permissioning, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery. Building on the gaps revealed by this analysis, we outline a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable and unambiguous goal specification, and a Policy Decision Record for auditable, verifiable policy enforcement across execution environments. We conclude by proposing a reproducible evaluation suite and benchmarks for assessing the safety, reliability, and economic robustness of agent-mediated on-chain execution.

*Brady Steele,Micah Katz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines multi-hop reasoning in LLMs, showing rule-based methods excel in structured tasks but fail in reasoning, while multi-agent LLMs do the opposite. Key findings highlight multi-agent benefits depend on base model strength, active parameters predict performance, and architecture quality matters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To dissociate task-method performance in LLMs, focusing on cross-document reasoning and structured retrieval, and understand the role of multi-agent systems and architecture in reasoning tasks.

Method: A synthetic evaluation framework tested four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B) across 120 trials, comparing rule-based and multi-agent approaches.

Result: Multi-agent systems achieved up to 80% success in reasoning tasks where rule-based methods failed (6.7%). Gains depended on base model capability, active parameters, and architecture quality (e.g., LLaMA-3 8B outperformed LLaMA-2 13B).

Conclusion: Multi-agent coordination benefits reasoning tasks but relies on base model strength. Active parameters and architecture quality are key predictors of performance. The framework aids reproducible research.

Abstract: We present a controlled study of multi-hop contextual reasoning in large language models, providing a clean demonstration of the task-method dissociation: rule-based pattern matching achieves 100% success on structured information retrieval but only 6.7% on tasks requiring cross-document reasoning, while LLM-based multi-agent systems show the inverse pattern, achieving up to 80% on reasoning tasks where rule-based methods fail. Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements. Our results provide controlled quantitative evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, while highlighting the dependence of multi-agent benefits on base model capability. We release our evaluation framework to support reproducible research on reasoning in mid-scale models.

TL;DR: Proposes a Reasoner-Verifier framework (ARR) to enhance reasoning and verification in retrieval-augmented generation by addressing single-perspective limitations and outcome-oriented rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations in current large reasoning models (LRMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), such as single-perspective reasoning and reliance on outcome-oriented rewards, which hinder deep self-correcting reasoning.

Method: Introduces the Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR) framework, where a Reasoner and Verifier collaborate to critique each other's logic, guided by process-aware advantage combining observational signals and model uncertainty.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness through experiments on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The ARR framework successfully improves reasoning fidelity and verification rigor in retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in synergizing large reasoning models (LRMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising results, yet two critical challenges remain: (1) reasoning models typically operate from a single, unchallenged perspective, limiting their ability to conduct deep, self-correcting reasoning over external documents, and (2) existing training paradigms rely excessively on outcome-oriented rewards, which provide insufficient signal for shaping the complex, multi-step reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose an Reasoner-Verifier framework named Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR). The Reasoner and Verifier engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence and critiquing each other's logic while being guided by process-aware advantage that requires no external scoring model. This reward combines explicit observational signals with internal model uncertainty to jointly optimize reasoning fidelity and verification rigor. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: RLMIL-DAT improves multilingual speaker attribute prediction by combining reinforcement learning with domain adversarial training, showing consistent gains in Macro F1, especially for gender prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges like linguistic variation, domain mismatch, and data imbalance in multilingual speaker attribute prediction.

Method: Proposes RLMIL-DAT, extending reinforced multiple instance learning with domain adversarial training for language-invariant representations.

Result: Consistent Macro F1 improvements, with notable gains for gender prediction and smaller but positive gains for age prediction. Ablation shows domain adversarial training drives performance.

Conclusion: Combining instance selection and adversarial domain adaptation is effective and robust for cross-lingual speaker attribute prediction.

Abstract: We study multilingual speaker attribute prediction under linguistic variation, domain mismatch, and data imbalance across languages. We propose RLMIL-DAT, a multilingual extension of the reinforced multiple instance learning framework that combines reinforcement learning based instance selection with domain adversarial training to encourage language invariant utterance representations. We evaluate the approach on a five language Twitter corpus in a few shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero shot setting for gender and age prediction. Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages. Overall, the results demonstrate that combining instance selection with adversarial domain adaptation is an effective and robust strategy for cross lingual speaker attribute prediction.

*Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores replacing multi-agent AI systems with a single agent using skill libraries, achieving efficiency gains but uncovering scalability limits influenced by semantic confusability. It draws parallels to human cognition and suggests hierarchical organization as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve modularity benefits of multi-agent systems with fewer computational overheads by using skill selection in a single agent, while understanding scalability challenges.

Method: Compiles multi-agent systems into single-agent equivalents, investigates skill selection scaling, and applies cognitive science principles to analyze limits and hierarchical solutions.

Result: Skill selection reduces token usage and latency without sacrificing accuracy but shows a phase transition in scalability due to semantic confusability. Hierarchical routing mitigates degradation.

Conclusion: The study highlights cognitive-like limits in skill selection and proposes hierarchical organization for scalable AI systems, offering practical design guidelines.

Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems have proven effective for complex reasoning. These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?
  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents.

Motivation: The study aims to uncover the computational strategies LLMs use for propositional reasoning, addressing gaps left by prior mechanistic studies that focused on task-specific circuits.

Method: The authors analyze Qwen3 (8B and 14B) models on PropLogic-MI, a controlled dataset covering 11 propositional logic rule categories for one-hop and two-hop reasoning.

Result: The analysis identifies four interlocking mechanisms forming a coherent computational architecture, which generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths.

Conclusion: The findings provide mechanistic evidence that LLMs use structured strategies for logical reasoning, offering deeper insights into their internal functioning.

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform logical reasoning internally remains a fundamental challenge. While prior mechanistic studies focus on identifying taskspecific circuits, they leave open the question of what computational strategies LLMs employ for propositional reasoning. We address this gap through comprehensive analysis of Qwen3 (8B and 14B) on PropLogic-MI, a controlled dataset spanning 11 propositional logic rule categories across one-hop and two-hop reasoning. Rather than asking ''which components are necessary,'' we ask ''how does the model organize computation?'' Our analysis reveals a coherent computational architecture comprising four interlocking mechanisms: Staged Computation (layer-wise processing phases), Information Transmission (information flow aggregation at boundary tokens), Fact Retrospection (persistent re-access of source facts), and Specialized Attention Heads (functionally distinct head types). These mechanisms generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths, providing mechanistic evidence that LLMs employ structured computational strategies for logical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the threat of indirect prompt injection (IPI) in LLM agents controlling physical systems, proposing a method that filters malicious code via tool result parsing while maintaining utility and low attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing role of LLM agents in physical control systems exposes them to IPI attacks, where adversaries hijack decision-making via malicious tool call results. Existing defenses are either computationally expensive or ineffective, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The proposed method involves parsing tool results precisely to filter out malicious code, leveraging LLM capabilities without high computational overhead or frequent updates.

Result: The approach achieves competitive utility under attack while significantly reducing attack success rates, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully mitigates IPI risks in LLM agents, offering a balance between utility and security with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: As LLM agents transition from digital assistants to physical controllers in autonomous systems and robotics, they face an escalating threat from indirect prompt injection. By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code. Our approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods. Code is available at GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework where intelligence and consciousness stem from relational structures, not prediction or domain-specific mechanisms, emphasizing causal connections and context enrichment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To redefine intelligence and consciousness by focusing on relational structures and recursive interpretations, challenging traditional predictive processing views.

Method: Proposes a conceptual framework integrating causal connections and context enrichment, introducing recursive architectures for consciousness emergence.

Result: Intelligence arises from relational integration; consciousness emerges from recursive interpretations across systems, suggesting new AI design principles.

Conclusion: The framework shifts focus from prediction to relational structures, proposing recursive architectures for human-like AI.

Abstract: This paper proposes a conceptual framework in which intelligence and consciousness emerge from relational structure rather than from prediction or domain-specific mechanisms. Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.
  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.
  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper argues that over-reliance on machine learning hinders SAE Level 5 AVs and proposes using automated commonsense reasoning to address data-scarce abnormal road scenarios, demonstrating improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of deep learning in autonomous vehicles by addressing scenarios with insufficient data.

Method: Deploying automated commonsense reasoning for situations like malfunctioning traffic signals and unexpected obstructions, measured via uncertainty.

Result: Commonsense reasoning corrected AV object detection misclassifications in CARLA simulator tests.

Conclusion: Hybrid models combining machine learning and commonsense reasoning improve AV perception.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has been heavily researched and sought after, yet there are no SAE Level 5 AVs available today in the marketplace. We contend that over-reliance on machine learning technology is the main reason. Use of automated commonsense reasoning technology, we believe, can help achieve SAE Level 5 autonomy. In this paper, we show how automated common- sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain sce- narios. We describe our experiments conducted using the CARLA simulator and the results obtained. The main contribution of our research is to show that automated commonsense reasoning effectively corrects AV-based object detection misclassifications and that hybrid models provide an effective pathway to improving AV perception.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an alternative approach to abduction using modal vocabulary and explore its relation to epistemic states of only knowing.

Method: Extends Levesque logic with an abduction modal operator, incorporates preferential relations for non-monotonic extensions, and analyzes metatheoretic properties.

Result: Provides a well-behaved foundational framework for abductive reasoning with non-monotonic extensions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates modal logic and abduction, offering a robust foundation for abductive reasoning.

Abstract: The paper introduces a basic logic of knowledge and abduction by extending Levesque logic of only-knowing with an abduction modal operator defined via the combination of basic epistemic concepts. The upshot is an alternative approach to abduction that employs a modal vocabulary and explores the relation between abductive reasoning and epistemic states of only knowing. Furthermore, by incorporating a preferential relation into modal frames, we provide a non-monotonic extension of our basic framework capable of expressing different selection methods for abductive explanations. Core metatheoretic properties of non-monotonic consequence relations are explored within this setting and shown to provide a well-behaved foundation for abductive reasoning.

Abstract: The deployment of knowledge representation and reasoning technologies in aeronautics applications presents two main challenges: achieving sufficient expressivity to capture complex domain knowledge, and executing reasoning tasks efficiently while minimizing memory usage and computational overhead. An effective strategy for attaining necessary expressivity involves integrating two fundamental KR concepts: rules and ontologies. This study adopts the well-established KR language Hybrid MKNF owing to its seamless integration of rules and ontologies through its semantics and query answering capabilities. We evaluated Hybrid MKNF to assess its suitability in the aeronautics domain through a concrete case study. We identified additional  expressivity features  that are crucial for developing aeronautics applications and proposed a set of heuristics to support their integration into Hybrid MKNF framework.

*Stuti Sinha,Himanshu Kumar,Aryan Raju Mandapati,Rakshit Sakhuja,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Language choice in LLM negotiations affects outcomes more than model changes, with Indic languages altering stability and exploration, challenging English-only evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language choice impacts LLM negotiation outcomes, revealing biases in English-only evaluations.

Method: Controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games in English and four Indic languages.

Result: Language shifts outcomes strongly, reversing advantages and reallocating surplus, with task-contingent effects.

Conclusion: English-only LLM evaluations are incomplete; culturally-aware assessment is crucial for fair deployment.

Abstract: Negotiation is a core component of social intelligence, requiring agents to balance strategic reasoning, cooperation, and social norms. Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment.

TL;DR: An adaptive system for clustering multi-service customer chats improves cluster quality metrics significantly without requiring full reclustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods are ineffective for overlapping concerns and degrade over time, disrupting issue tracking.

Method: Proposes segmenting chats into service-specific concerns and incrementally refining clusters using LLM-based splitting for degraded clusters, tracked via Silhouette Scores and Davies-Bouldin Index.

Result: Improves Silhouette Scores by over 100% and reduces Davies-Bouldin Index by 65.6% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The method enables scalable, real-time analytics by avoiding full reclustering and maintaining high cluster quality.

Abstract: Clustering customer chat data is vital for cloud providers handling multi service queries. Traditional methods struggle with overlapping concerns and create broad, static clusters that degrade over time. Reclustering disrupts continuity, making issue tracking difficult. We propose an adaptive system that segments multi turn chats into service specific concerns and incrementally refines clusters as new issues arise. Cluster quality is tracked via DaviesBouldin Index and Silhouette Scores, with LLM based splitting applied only to degraded clusters. Our method improves Silhouette Scores by over 100\% and reduces DBI by 65.6\% compared to baselines, enabling scalable, real time analytics without full reclustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and automate the traditionally manual and time-consuming process of generating high-quality scientific figures.

Method: Hierarchical layout generation parses text to identify component relationships and groups them into modules. An iterative CoT feedback mechanism refines layouts.

Result: SciFig achieves 70.1% and 66.2% quality scores on dataset- and paper-specific evaluations, excelling in clarity, organization, and accuracy.

Conclusion: SciFig effectively automates figure generation with high quality, and its pipeline and evaluation benchmark will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Creating high-quality figures and visualizations for scientific papers is a time-consuming task that requires both deep domain knowledge and professional design skills. Despite over 2.5 million scientific papers published annually, the figure generation process remains largely manual. We introduce $\textbf{SciFig}$, an end-to-end AI agent system that generates publication-ready pipeline figures directly from research paper texts. SciFig uses a hierarchical layout generation strategy, which parses research descriptions to identify component relationships, groups related elements into functional modules, and generates inter-module connections to establish visual organization. Furthermore, an iterative chain-of-thought (CoT) feedback mechanism progressively improves layouts through multiple rounds of visual analysis and reasoning. We introduce a rubric-based evaluation framework that analyzes 2,219 real scientific figures to extract evaluation rubrics and automatically generates comprehensive evaluation criteria. SciFig demonstrates remarkable performance: achieving 70.1$\%$ overall quality on dataset-level evaluation and 66.2$\%$ on paper-specific evaluation, and consistently high scores across metrics such as visual clarity, structural organization, and scientific accuracy. SciFig figure generation pipeline and our evaluation benchmark will be open-sourced.

### [195] [Assessing the quality and coherence of word embeddings after SCM-based intersectional bias mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04393)
*Eren Kocadag,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores intersectional bias mitigation in static word embeddings using Stereotype Content Model (SCM) with methods like Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection, balancing neighborhood coherence and analogy behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address social biases absorbed by static word embeddings and extend bias mitigation to intersectional identities, broadening beyond single-group analysis.

Method: Compound representations for identity pairs are created via summation or concatenation, followed by debiasing strategies (Subtraction, Linear Projection, Partial Projection). Evaluated on Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch embeddings.

Result: SCM-based mitigation works well intersectionally, preserving semantics. Trade-offs exist: stricter geometry preservation affects analogy behavior, while aggressive projections improve analogies but disrupt neighborhoods. Partial Projection is conservative; Linear Projection is assertive; Subtraction remains competitive.

Conclusion: Intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical, with method choice depending on embedding family and application goals, balancing stability and analogy performance.

Abstract: Static word embeddings often absorb social biases from the text they learn from, and those biases can quietly shape downstream systems. Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embed- dings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance.

### [196] [Transitive Expert Error and Routing Problems in Complex AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04416)
*Forest Mars*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transitive Expert Error (TEE) occurs when domain experts make systematic errors at domain boundaries due to structural similarity bias and authority persistence, amplified by specific conditions. Similar issues arise in AI systems, but architectural interventions can mitigate them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to identify and address systematic errors experts make at domain boundaries, extending insights to AI systems to improve their reliability.

Method: The study examines cognitive mechanisms like structural similarity bias and authority persistence, then translates findings to AI architectures (e.g., MoE systems, RAG systems) to propose interventions.

Result: TEE manifests as confident but incorrect outputs in AI systems, detectable through routing patterns or confidence-accuracy mismatches. Architectural solutions like multi-expert activation and boundary-aware calibration can mitigate errors.

Conclusion: While TEE is inherent in human cognition, AI systems can explicitly address it through design, turning cognitive limitations into tractable engineering problems.

Abstract: Domain expertise enhances judgment within boundaries but creates systematic vulnerabilities specifically at borders. We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable. We propose interventions: multi-expert activation with disagreement detection (router level), boundary-aware calibration (specialist level), and coverage gap detection (training level). TEE has detectable signatures (routing patterns, confidence-accuracy dissociations, domain-inappropriate content) enabling monitoring and mitigation. What remains intractable in human cognition becomes addressable through architectural design.

TL;DR: XGrammar 2 is introduced as an optimized structured generation engine for LLMs, featuring TagDispatch semantics, JIT compilation, cross-grammar caching, and advanced parsing algorithms, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM agents face challenges in handling dynamic structured generation tasks, necessitating a more efficient engine.

Method: Proposes XGrammar 2 with TagDispatch semantics, JIT compilation, cross-grammar caching, Earley-parser-based mask generation, and repetition compression.

Result: Achieves over 6x speedup and handles dynamic tasks with near-zero overhead.

Conclusion: XGrammar 2 effectively optimizes structured generation for LLMs, outperforming existing engines.

Abstract: Modern LLM agents are required to handle increasingly complex structured generation tasks, such as tool calling and conditional structured generation. These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars. Additionally, we extend the previous PDA-based mask generation algorithm to the Earley-parser-based one and design a repetition compression algorithm to handle repetition structures in grammars. Evaluation results show that XGrammar 2 can achieve more than 6x speedup over the existing structured generation engines. Integrated with an LLM inference engine, XGrammar 2 can handle dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead.

*Enrique ter Horst,Sridhar Mahadevan,Juan Diego Zambrano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A categorical framework for belief propagation (BP) on factor graphs is developed, unifying exact inference, junction trees, and loopy BP failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a structured, categorical foundation for belief propagation, addressing challenges like exact inference and loopy BP failures.

Method: Constructs a free hypergraph category, formulates message-passing via a Grothendieck fibration, and introduces HATCC for detecting and resolving obstructions.

Result: Demonstrates exact inference with speedups over junction trees and UNSAT detection on satisfiability instances.

Conclusion: The framework unifies various BP methods and offers practical improvements for inference tasks.

Abstract: We develop a categorical foundation for belief propagation on factor graphs. We construct the free hypergraph category \(\Syn_Σ\) on a typed signature and prove its universal property, yielding compositional semantics via a unique functor to the matrix category \(\cat{Mat}_R\). Message-passing is formulated using a Grothendieck fibration \(\int\Msg \to \cat{FG}_Σ\) over polarized factor graphs, with schedule-indexed endomorphisms defining BP updates. We characterize exact inference as effective descent: local beliefs form a descent datum when compatibility conditions hold on overlaps. This framework unifies tree exactness, junction tree algorithms, and loopy BP failures under sheaf-theoretic obstructions. We introduce HATCC (Holonomy-Aware Tree Compilation), an algorithm that detects descent obstructions via holonomy computation on the factor nerve, compiles non-trivial holonomy into mode variables, and reduces to tree BP on an augmented graph. Complexity is \(O(n^2 d_{\max} + c \cdot k_{\max} \cdot δ_{\max}^3 + n \cdot δ_{\max}^2)\) for \(n\) factors and \(c\) fundamental cycles. Experimental results demonstrate exact inference with significant speedup over junction trees on grid MRFs and random graphs, along with UNSAT detection on satisfiability instances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues computational methods are essential for AI systems to comply with regulations efficiently, proposing design goals and benchmarks for algorithmic AIR compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance methods are inadequate for AI regulation (AIR) due to speed and scale; computational solutions are necessary.

Method: Proposes algorithmic solutions operating across an AI system's lifecycle, with design goals and benchmark datasets for evaluation.

Result: Specifies design goals and a benchmark dataset to quantitatively assess algorithmic compliance performance.

Conclusion: Provides a blueprint to advance research in computational AIR compliance and encourage investment in this emerging domain.

Abstract: The era of AI regulation (AIR) is upon us. But AI systems, we argue, will not be able to comply with these regulations at the necessary speed and scale by continuing to rely on traditional, analogue methods of compliance. Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms. In addition, we specify a benchmark dataset that can be used to quantitatively measure whether individual algorithms satisfy these design goals. By delivering this blueprint, we hope to give shape to an important but uncrystallized new domain of research - and, in doing so, incite necessary investment in it.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUITester, a multi-agent framework, addresses challenges in exploratory GUI testing by decoupling navigation from verification, achieving superior performance on the new benchmark GUITestBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploratory GUI testing is costly and MLLM agents struggle with autonomous defect discovery due to Goal-Oriented Masking and Execution-Bias Attribution.

Method: Proposes GUITester with a Planning-Execution Module (PEM) for defect probing and a Hierarchical Reflection Module (HRM) for resolving attribution ambiguity.

Result: GUITester achieves a 48.90% F1-score (Pass@3) on GUITestBench, outperforming baselines (33.35%).

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of autonomous exploratory testing and lays groundwork for future GUI quality assurance.

Abstract: Exploratory GUI testing is essential for software quality but suffers from high manual costs. While Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents excel in navigation, they fail to autonomously discover defects due to two core challenges: \textit{Goal-Oriented Masking}, where agents prioritize task completion over reporting anomalies, and \textit{Execution-Bias Attribution}, where system defects are misidentified as agent errors. To address these, we first introduce \textbf{GUITestBench}, the first interactive benchmark for this task, featuring 143 tasks across 26 defects. We then propose \textbf{GUITester}, a multi-agent framework that decouples navigation from verification via two modules: (i) a \textit{Planning-Execution Module (PEM)} that proactively probes for defects via embedded testing intents, and (ii) a \textit{Hierarchical Reflection Module (HRM)} that resolves attribution ambiguity through interaction history analysis. GUITester achieves an F1-score of 48.90\% (Pass@3) on GUITestBench, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (33.35\%). Our work demonstrates the feasibility of autonomous exploratory testing and provides a robust foundation for future GUI quality assurance~\footnote{Our code is now available in~\href{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}}.

TL;DR: An SEI approach using active learning and semi-supervised training improves recognition accuracy with lower labeling costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high cost and time consumption of obtaining large-scale labeled data for SEI model training.

Method: A three-stage semi-supervised training scheme involving self-supervised contrastive learning, supervised training with joint loss optimization, and active learning for sample selection.

Result: Outperforms conventional methods on ADS-B and WiFi datasets under limited labeling conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed SEI approach enhances generalization and achieves higher accuracy efficiently.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of wireless communications, specific emitter identification (SEI) is significant for communication security. However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets. Experimental results on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets demonstrate that the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms the conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention-driven neural architecture to enhance mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) by overcoming limitations of graph neural networks (GNNs) through global information exchange.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MILP is computationally challenging at scale, and existing GNN-based approaches are limited by local mechanisms, restricting representation power and solver efficiency.

Method: A dual-attention mechanism is introduced to perform self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling deeper representation learning and global information exchange.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Attention-based neural architectures are a powerful foundation for learning-enhanced MILP optimization.

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), a widely used modeling framework for combinatorial optimization, are central to many scientific and engineering applications, yet remains computationally challenging at scale. Recent advances in deep learning address this challenge by representing MILP instances as variable-constraint bipartite graphs and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract latent structural patterns and enhance solver efficiency. However, this architecture is inherently limited by the local-oriented mechanism, leading to restricted representation power and hindering neural approaches for MILP. Here we present an attention-driven neural architecture that learns expressive representations beyond the pure graph view. A dual-attention mechanism is designed to perform parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning. We apply this general backbone to various downstream tasks at the instance level, element level, and solving state level. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmarks show consistent improvements of our approach over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting attention-based neural architectures as a powerful foundation for learning-enhanced mixed-integer linear optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling data is costly and fully unlabeled datasets are rare, making SSL with pseudo-labels and distribution matching a practical solution.

Method: Incorporates distribution matching between labeled and unlabeled feature embeddings in pseudo-label-based SSL.

Result: Improved image classification accuracy across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Distribution matching enhances pseudo-label-based SSL, offering a viable approach for semi-supervised learning.

Abstract: The advancement of deep learning has greatly improved supervised image classification. However, labeling data is costly, prompting research into unsupervised learning methods such as contrastive learning. In real-world scenarios, fully unlabeled datasets are rare, making semi-supervised learning (SSL) highly relevant in scenarios where a small amount of labeled data coexists with a large volume of unlabeled data. A well-known semi-supervised contrastive learning approach involves assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data. This study aims to enhance pseudo-label-based SSL by incorporating distribution matching between labeled and unlabeled feature embeddings to improve image classification accuracy across multiple datasets.

Motivation: Biomedical QA systems struggle with HID and MSR due to lack of fine-grained datasets; BioPIE fills this gap.

Method: Introduces BioPIE, a dataset with procedure-centric KGs, and evaluates it with info extraction methods and QA systems.

Result: BioPIE supports reasoning, showing performance gains on test, HID, and MSR question sets.

Conclusion: Structured knowledge in BioPIE enhances AI-assisted biomedical experimentation.

Abstract: Question Answer (QA) systems for biomedical experiments facilitate cross-disciplinary communication, and serve as a foundation for downstream tasks, e.g., laboratory automation. High Information Density (HID) and Multi-Step Reasoning (MSR) pose unique challenges for biomedical experimental QA. While extracting structured knowledge, e.g., Knowledge Graphs (KGs), can substantially benefit biomedical experimental QA. Existing biomedical datasets focus on general or coarsegrained knowledge and thus fail to support the fine-grained experimental reasoning demanded by HID and MSR. To address this gap, we introduce Biomedical Protocol Information Extraction Dataset (BioPIE), a dataset that provides procedure-centric KGs of experimental entities, actions, and relations at a scale that supports reasoning over biomedical experiments across protocols. We evaluate information extraction methods on BioPIE, and implement a QA system that leverages BioPIE, showcasing performance gains on test, HID, and MSR question sets, showing that the structured experimental knowledge in BioPIE underpins both AI-assisted and more autonomous biomedical experimentation.

TL;DR: TCAR is an adaptive router for multi-agent systems that improves accuracy and robustness by dynamically onboarding agents and generating reasoning chains before routing queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing routing strategies in MAS face limitations like difficulty integrating new agents and routing conflicts due to overlapping capabilities.

Method: TCAR introduces dynamic agent onboarding, generates reasoning chains for routing, and uses a collaborative execution pipeline with a Refining Agent.

Result: TCAR improves routing accuracy, reduces conflicts, and performs robustly in ambiguous scenarios.

Conclusion: TCAR addresses key limitations in MAS routing and supports future research in collaborative multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have become a powerful paradigm for building high performance intelligent applications. Within these systems, the router responsible for determining which expert agents should handle a given query plays a crucial role in overall performance. Existing routing strategies generally fall into two categories: performance routing, which balances latency and cost across models of different sizes, and task routing, which assigns queries to domain-specific experts to improve accuracy. In real-world enterprise applications, task routing is more suitable; however, most existing approaches rely on static single-label decisions, which introduce two major limitations: (i) difficulty in seamlessly integrating new agents as business domains expand, and (ii) routing conflicts caused by overlapping agent capabilities, ultimately degrading accuracy and robustness.To address these challenges, we propose TCAndon-Router(TCAR): an adaptive reasoning router for multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional routers, TCAR supports dynamic agent onboarding and first generates a natural-language reasoning chain before predicting a set of candidate agents capable of handling the query. In addition, we design a collaborative execution pipeline in which selected agents independently produce responses, which are then aggregated and refined into a single high-quality response by a dedicated Refining Agent.Experiments on public datasets and real enterprise data demonstrate that TCAR significantly improves routing accuracy, reduces routing conflicts, and remains robust in ambiguous scenarios. We have released TCAR at https://huggingface.co/tencent/TCAndon-Router to support future research on explainable and collaborative multi-agent routing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-centric AI systems face uncertainties in long-term operation due to untested corner cases, risking safety, sustainability, and security.

Method: Analysis of existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security in AI systems, followed by proposing personalized model-based solutions.

Result: Identifies limitations in current methods for long-term testing and suggests tailored solutions.

Conclusion: Personalized models can address gaps in ensuring safety, sustainability, and security for AI-enabled human-centric systems.

Abstract: Human centric critical systems are increasingly involving artificial intelligence to enable knowledge extraction from sensor collected data. Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, gesture based human computer interaction systems, and autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate for a long term potentially for a lifetime in many scenarios such as closed loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoting systems for stroke diagnosis, and rehabilitation. Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system. In this paper, we analyze the existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security analysis of an AI enabled human centric control system and discuss their limitations for testing the system for long term use in practice. We then propose personalized model based solutions for potentially eliminating such limitations.

TL;DR: ROS leverages geographic signals for LLM-based recommendations, improving hit rates and cross-city transfer via hierarchical spatial IDs and mobility CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based recommenders struggle with geographic signals, which are crucial for mobility and local-services scenarios.

Method: ROS uses Hierarchical Spatial Semantic IDs and a three-stage Mobility Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, enhanced with spatial-guided RL.

Result: ROS achieves over 10% relative gains in hit rate and improves cross-city transfer compared to baselines.

Conclusion: ROS effectively integrates geography into LLM reasoning, enhancing recommendation performance.

Abstract: Generative recommendation with large language models (LLMs) reframes prediction as sequence generation, yet existing LLM-based recommenders remain limited in leveraging geographic signals that are crucial in mobility and local-services scenarios. Here, we present Reasoning Over Space (ROS), a framework that utilizes geography as a vital decision variable within the reasoning process. ROS introduces a Hierarchical Spatial Semantic ID (SID) that discretizes coarse-to-fine locality and POI semantics into compositional tokens, and endows LLM with a three-stage Mobility Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that models user personality, constructs an intent-aligned candidate space, and performs locality informed pruning. We further align the model with real world geography via spatial-guided Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on three widely used location-based social network (LBSN) datasets show that ROS achieves over 10% relative gains in hit rate over strongest LLM-based baselines and improves cross-city transfer, despite using a smaller backbone model.

### [208] [BackdoorAgent: A Unified Framework for Backdoor Attacks on LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04566)
*Yunhao Feng,Yige Li,Yutao Wu,Yingshui Tan,Yanming Guo,Yifan Ding,Kun Zhai,Xingjun Ma,Yugang Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BackdoorAgent, a framework to systematically study backdoor threats in LLM agents, highlighting vulnerabilities across planning, memory, and tool-use stages, and provides a benchmark for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on backdoor threats in LLM agents are fragmented and lack a unified perspective, leaving cross-stage interactions and trigger propagation poorly understood.

Method: Proposes BackdoorAgent, a modular framework dividing attacks into planning, memory, and tool-use stages, and instruments execution to analyze trigger activation and propagation. Includes a benchmark covering four agent applications.

Result: Empirical analysis shows triggers persist across stages, e.g., persistence rates of 43.58% (planning), 77.97% (memory), and 60.28% (tool-use) in GPT-based agents.

Conclusion: Agentic workflows are vulnerable to backdoor threats, and BackdoorAgent provides a standardized framework for future research, with code and benchmark publicly available.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents execute tasks through multi-step workflows that combine planning, memory, and tool use. While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \textbf{planning attacks}, \textbf{memory attacks}, and \textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \textbf{Agent QA}, \textbf{Agent Code}, \textbf{Agent Web}, and \textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\% of planning attacks, 77.97\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, our code and benchmark are publicly available at GitHub.

*Yash Saxena,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neurosymbolic RAG, integrating symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval to address transparency issues in traditional RAG systems. Preliminary results show improved interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems lack transparency in their neural components, complicating interpretability and trust, especially in high-stakes domains.

Method: Introduces Neurosymbolic RAG with three methods: MAR (modulation networks for interpretable features), KG-Path RAG (knowledge graph traversal), and Process Knowledge-infused RAG (domain-specific workflow reordering).

Result: Preliminary results indicate enhanced transparency and performance in mental health risk assessment tasks.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic RAG offers a promising solution for improving transparency and interpretability in retrieval-augmented generation systems.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has made significant strides in overcoming key limitations of large language models, such as hallucination, lack of contextual grounding, and issues with transparency. However, traditional RAG systems consist of three interconnected neural components - the retriever, re-ranker, and generator - whose internal reasoning processes remain opaque. This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection? (b) Can symbolic knowledge enhance the clarity of the retrieval process? We propose three methods to improve this integration. First is MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) that employs modulation networks to refine query embeddings using interpretable symbolic features, thereby making document matching more explicit. Second, KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs to improve overall retrieval quality and interpretability. Lastly, Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows. Preliminary results from mental health risk assessment tasks indicate that this neurosymbolic approach enhances both transparency and overall performance

TL;DR: The paper introduces CIEA, a multimodal retrieval approach that extracts and aligns complementary information in images and text, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal retrieval methods often overlook complementary information in multimodal data, focusing only on similarities with paired texts.

Method: CIEA transforms text and images into a unified latent space and includes a complementary information extractor. It uses two complementary contrastive losses for optimization.

Result: CIEA significantly improves over divide-and-conquer and universal dense retrieval models, as shown by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CIEA advances multimodal retrieval by effectively capturing complementary information, with its source code made available for further research.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval has emerged as a promising yet challenging research direction in recent years. Most existing studies in multimodal retrieval focus on capturing information in multimodal data that is similar to their paired texts, but often ignores the complementary information contained in multimodal data. In this study, we propose CIEA, a novel multimodal retrieval approach that employs Complementary Information Extraction and Alignment, which transforms both text and images in documents into a unified latent space and features a complementary information extractor designed to identify and preserve differences in the image representations. We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CIEA, which achieves significant improvements over both divide-and-conquer models and universal dense retrieval models. We provide an ablation study, further discussions, and case studies to highlight the advancements achieved by CIEA. To promote further research in the community, we have released the source code at https://github.com/zengdlong/CIEA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A resurgence in behavior cloning is explored with scaling models and data sizes. The study introduces an open recipe for training a video game playing foundation model, releasing data, code, and checkpoints. The model performs competitively with humans and examines scaling laws and causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage behavior cloning's potential, the study aims to understand how model and data scaling impact performance and causal reasoning in video game playing.

Method: The work introduces an open training recipe, releases extensive gameplay data, and trains models up to 1.2B parameters. Scaling laws and causal reasoning are systematically examined.

Result: The best model plays 3D games competitively with humans. Scaling increases causal reasoning, as shown in toy problems and larger models.

Conclusion: Behavior cloning benefits from scaling model and data sizes, enhancing performance and causal reasoning in video game tasks.

Abstract: Behavior cloning is enjoying a resurgence in popularity as scaling both model and data sizes proves to provide a strong starting point for many tasks of interest. In this work, we introduce an open recipe for training a video game playing foundation model designed for inference in realtime on a consumer GPU. We release all data (8300+ hours of high quality human gameplay), training and inference code, and pretrained checkpoints under an open license. We show that our best model is capable of playing a variety of 3D video games at a level competitive with human play. We use this recipe to systematically examine the scaling laws of behavior cloning to understand how the model's performance and causal reasoning varies with model and data scale. We first show in a simple toy problem that, for some types of causal reasoning, increasing both the amount of training data and the depth of the network results in the model learning a more causal policy. We then systematically study how causality varies with the number of parameters (and depth) and training steps in scaled models of up to 1.2 billion parameters, and we find similar scaling results to what we observe in the toy problem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand and quantify the intellectual synthesis behind AI breakthroughs to aid systematic analysis and AI research agent development.

Method: Used community-validated quality signals and an LLM-accelerated, human-verified pipeline to trace and structure reasoning links in high-quality AI papers from NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR (2023-2025).

Result: Identified 15 thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies (52.7% combined) and powerful combinations of these patterns.

Conclusion: Sci-Reasoning enables quantitative study of scientific progress and provides structured reasoning trajectories for training AI research agents.

Abstract: While AI innovation accelerates rapidly, the intellectual process behind breakthroughs -- how researchers identify gaps, synthesize prior work, and generate insights -- remains poorly understood. The lack of structured data on scientific reasoning hinders systematic analysis and development of AI research agents. We introduce Sci-Reasoning, the first dataset capturing the intellectual synthesis behind high-quality AI research. Using community-validated quality signals and an LLM-accelerated, human-verified pipeline, we trace Oral and Spotlight papers across NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR (2023-2025) to its key predecessors, articulating specific reasoning links in a structured format. Our analysis identifies 15 distinct thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies accounting for 52.7%: Gap-Driven Reframing (24.2%), Cross-Domain Synthesis (18.0%), and Representation Shift (10.5%). The most powerful innovation recipes combine multiple patterns: Gap-Driven Reframing + Representation Shift, Cross-Domain Synthesis + Representation Shift, and Gap-Driven Reframing + Cross-Domain Synthesis. This dataset enables quantitative studies of scientific progress and provides structured reasoning trajectories for training the next generation AI research agents.

*Paras Jain,Khushi Dhar,Olyemi E. Amujo,Esa M. Rantanen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how human cognition and machine learning collaborate to detect phishing emails, finding that humans use diverse linguistic cues while AI varies in confidence. Aging affects detection, but language proficiency doesn't.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans and AI can work together to identify deceptive content like phishing emails by leveraging their respective strengths—human linguistic insights and AI accuracy.

Method: Used Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests trained on TF-IDF features and semantic embeddings, comparing their predictions to human evaluations (confidence ratings and linguistic observations).

Result: Machine learning models achieved good accuracy but displayed inconsistent confidence levels. Humans relied on varied linguistic cues and showed more consistent confidence. Aging impacted detection, while language proficiency didn't.

Conclusion: The findings help design transparent AI systems that complement human cognition, enhancing human-AI collaboration in complex tasks like phishing detection.

Abstract: Identifying deceptive content like phishing emails demands sophisticated cognitive processes that combine pattern recognition, confidence assessment, and contextual analysis. This research examines how human cognition and machine learn- ing models work together to distinguish phishing emails from legitimate ones. We employed three interpretable algorithms Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests train- ing them on both TF-IDF features and semantic embeddings, then compared their predictions against human evaluations that captured confidence ratings and linguistic observations. Our results show that machine learning models provide good accuracy rates, but their confidence levels vary significantly. Human evaluators, on the other hand, use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence. We also found that while language proficiency has minimal effect on detection performance, aging does. These findings offer helpful direction for creating transparent AI systems that complement human cognitive functions, ultimately improving human-AI cooperation in challenging content analysis tasks.

### [214] [AgentDevel: Reframing Self-Evolving LLM Agents as Release Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04620)
*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentDevel reframes LLM agent improvement as release engineering, introducing a pipeline for stable, auditable upgrades with fewer regressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent improvement methods are unstable and hard to audit. AgentDevel addresses this by treating agents as shippable artifacts with externalized improvement pipelines.

Method: AgentDevel uses an implementation-blind LLM critic, script-based diagnosis, and flip-centered gating to iteratively improve agents while ensuring non-regression.

Result: Tests show stable improvements with fewer regressions, producing auditable artifacts.

Conclusion: AgentDevel offers a practical approach for developing and releasing LLM agents with a focus on reproducibility and non-regression.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) agents has largely focused on embedding self-improvement mechanisms inside the agent or searching over many concurrent variants. While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs can analyze social phenomena, focusing on rumor propagation and psychological dynamics using a novel Rumor Detection Agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for psychological measurement and analyze rumor spread dynamics in real-world datasets.

Method: Developed a multistage Rumor Detection Agent combining fine-tuned RoBERTa, keyword filtering, and LLM verification (GPT-4o mini).

Result: Found dose-response belief reinforcement in homogeneous networks and rapid rumor contagion (25% infected in four iterations).

Conclusion: LLMs enable rigorous measurement of belief dynamics and misinformation spread in large datasets, transforming psychological science.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for analyzing social phenomena at scale. This paper demonstrates the value of LLMs in psychological measurement by (1) compiling the first large-scale dataset of election rumors on a niche alt-tech platform, (2) developing a multistage Rumor Detection Agent that leverages LLMs for high-precision content classification, and (3) quantifying the psychological dynamics of rumor propagation, specifically the "illusory truth effect" in a naturalistic setting. The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks. Simulation results further demonstrate rapid contagion effects: nearly one quarter of users become "infected" within just four propagation iterations. Taken together, these results illustrate how LLMs can transform psychological science by enabling the rigorous measurement of belief dynamics and misinformation spread in massive, real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Isabellm is an LLM-powered theorem prover for Isabelle/HOL, combining stepwise proving and proof planning with LLMs. It proves lemmas beyond standard automation but faces challenges in reliable code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance theorem proving in Isabelle/HOL by leveraging LLMs for automatic proof synthesis, addressing limitations of existing tools like Sledgehammer.

Method: Combines a stepwise prover (validating LLM-proposed commands) and a proof planner (generating Isar outlines). Uses beam search, ML/RL rerankers, premise selection, micro-RAG, and proof repair.

Result: Proves lemmas unattainable by Isabelle's standard automation, but struggles with reliable implementation of fill-and-repair mechanisms for complex designs.

Conclusion: LLM-guided proof search shows practical value but highlights challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning.

Abstract: We present Isabellm, an LLM-powered theorem prover for Isabelle/HOL that performs fully automatic proof synthesis. Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning. The code of Isabellm is available at https://github.com/zhehou/llm-isabelle

TL;DR: InstruCoT is a method enhancing LLMs to defend against diverse prompt injection attacks by using instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, showing superior performance across multiple security dimensions without compromising utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevalence of LLM-integrated applications highlights the need for robust defenses against prompt injection (PI) attacks, which are challenging due to diverse attack vectors and blurred semantic boundaries.

Method: InstruCoT synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning to help LLMs identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of context.

Result: Experiments on four LLMs show InstruCoT outperforms baselines in Behavior Deviation, Privacy Leakage, and Harmful Output, maintaining utility performance.

Conclusion: InstruCoT effectively addresses PI vulnerabilities, offering a reliable defense method without degrading LLM functionality.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-integrated applications have become increasingly prevalent, yet face critical security vulnerabilities from prompt injection (PI) attacks. Defending against PI attacks faces two major issues: malicious instructions can be injected through diverse vectors, and injected instructions often lack clear semantic boundaries from the surrounding context, making them difficult to identify. To address these issues, we propose InstruCoT, a model enhancement method for PI defense that synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, enabling LLMs to effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of their source or position in the context. We evaluate InstruCoT across three critical dimensions: Behavior Deviation, Privacy Leakage, and Harmful Output. Experimental results across four LLMs demonstrate that InstruCoT significantly outperforms baselines in all dimensions while maintaining utility performance without degradation

TL;DR: ResMAS enhances resilience in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) by optimizing communication topology and prompts through a two-stage framework, improving performance under perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS resilience strategies are reactive; this work proactively addresses resilience by analyzing topology and prompt design impacts.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) trains a reward model and topology generator via reinforcement learning, and (2) optimizes prompts based on topology.

Result: ResMAS significantly improves MAS resilience across tasks and shows strong generalization to new tasks/models.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for building resilient MASs, highlighting the importance of proactive design in system robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-based MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to solve complex tasks, have shown impressive performance in many areas. However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study OOD failure in RL under controlled rule shifts, ensuring fixed observation/action spaces.

Method: Derived from 1D cellular automata, Tape enables precise train/test splits. Evaluates model-free, model-based, and meta-RL methods.

Result: ID-strong methods fail OOD; high-variance OOD evaluation demands replication.

Conclusion: Tape provides standardized OOD protocols, statistical rigor, and theoretical insights for RL.

Abstract: We present Tape, a controlled reinforcement-learning benchmark designed to isolate out-of-distribution (OOD) failure under latent rule shifts.Tape is derived from one-dimensional cellular automata, enabling precise train/test splits where observation and action spaces are held fixed while transition rules change. Using a reproducible evaluation pipeline, we compare model-free baselines, model-based planning with learned world models, and task-inference (meta-RL) methods. A consistent pattern emerges: methods that are strong in-distribution (ID) can collapse under heldout-rule OOD, and high-variance OOD evaluation can make rankings unstable unless experiments are sufficiently replicated.We provide (i) standardized OOD protocols, (ii) statistical reporting requirements (seeds, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests), and (iii) information-theoretic identities connecting entropy reduction to conditional mutual information and expected posterior KL divergence, clarifying what "uncertainty reduction" objectives can and cannot guarantee under rule shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges like insufficient semantic understanding of unstructured data and lack of intelligent decision-making in digital transformation.

Method: Uses fine-tuned BERT for entity/relation extraction, GPT-4 for semantic vectors, a GNN architecture for knowledge graph construction, and reinforcement learning for decision path optimization.

Result: Reduced equipment failure response time by 53%, achieved 94.3% F1 score, and cut decision error costs by 45.3%.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs and knowledge graphs enhances digital transformation efficiency and intelligence.

Abstract: In the process of digital transformation, enterprises are faced with problems such as insufficient semantic understanding of unstructured data and lack of intelligent decision-making basis in driving mechanisms. This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.

*Yinuo Wang,Mining Tan,Wenxiang Jiao,Xiaoxi Li,Hao Wang,Xuanyu Zhang,Yuan Lu,Weiming Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TourPlanner proposes a framework combining multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning to address challenges in travel planning, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing travel planning methods struggle with pruning POIs, limited reasoning paths, and balancing hard/soft constraints.

Method: Develops Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) for POI selection and Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) for multi-path reasoning, integrating sigmoid-based gated reinforcement learning.

Result: TourPlanner outperforms benchmarks in feasibility and user-preference alignment.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges in travel planning through innovative multi-path reasoning and constraint handling.

Abstract: Travel planning is a sophisticated decision-making process that requires synthesizing multifaceted information to construct itineraries. However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met. Experimental results on travel planning benchmarks demonstrate that TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M-ASK introduces a multi-agent framework to improve agentic search by separating search behavior and knowledge management, leading to better accuracy and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current monolithic agent systems for agentic search face issues like unconstrained reasoning, sparse rewards, and noisy search, which hinder performance and learning.

Method: M-ASK decouples search into Search Behavior Agents (planning/executing actions) and Knowledge Management Agents (aggregating/filtering context), with turn-level rewards for coordination.

Result: Experiments show M-ASK outperforms baselines in multi-hop QA, achieving higher accuracy and more stable training.

Conclusion: The multi-agent approach in M-ASK effectively addresses bottlenecks in agentic search, improving both performance and learnability.

Abstract: Agentic search has emerged as a promising paradigm for complex information seeking by enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to interleave reasoning with tool use. However, prevailing systems rely on monolithic agents that suffer from structural bottlenecks, including unconstrained reasoning outputs that inflate trajectories, sparse outcome-level rewards that complicate credit assignment, and stochastic search noise that destabilizes learning. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context. This decomposition allows each agent to focus on a well-defined subtask and reduces interference between search and context construction. Furthermore, to enable stable coordination, M-ASK employs turn-level rewards to provide granular supervision for both search decisions and knowledge updates. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that M-ASK outperforms strong baselines, achieving not only superior answer accuracy but also significantly more stable training dynamics.\footnote{The source code for M-ASK is available at https://github.com/chenyiqun/M-ASK.}

### [223] [Bridging Temporal and Textual Modalities: A Multimodal Framework for Automated Cloud Failure Root Cause Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04709)
*Gijun Park*

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal framework to integrate time-series data with pretrained language models for improved root cause analysis in cloud infrastructure, achieving 48.75% diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methodologies struggle to align time-series performance metrics with language models, limiting their use in incident management. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The framework includes semantic compression for time-series data, an alignment encoder with gated cross-attention, and a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline.

Result: The framework achieved 48.75% diagnostic accuracy, with significant improvements in handling compound failure modes.

Conclusion: Embedding-space alignment effectively enables language models to reason over multimodal telemetry data, enhancing incident response.

Abstract: Root cause analysis in modern cloud infrastructure demands sophisticated understanding of heterogeneous data sources, particularly time-series performance metrics that involve core failure signatures. While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in textual reasoning, their discrete token-based architecture creates fundamental incompatibilities with continuous numerical sequences exhibiting temporal dependencies. Current methodologies inadequately address this modality mismatch, constraining the potential of language model-driven automation in incident management workflows. This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution. Comprehensive evaluation across six cloud system benchmarks demonstrates that our framework achieves leading performance, reaching 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes. The results validate embedding-space alignment as an effective strategy for enabling language models to reason over multimodal telemetry data in production incident response contexts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) technologies, their application in the domain of autonomous driving has become increasingly widespread. However, existing methods suffer from unstructured reasoning, poor generalization, and misalignment with human driving intent. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances decision transparency, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fails to fully exploit its potential, and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches face instability and suboptimal reasoning depth. We propose ThinkDrive, a CoT guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform SFT using CoT explanations. Then, we apply progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset. The results show that ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines by 1.45%, 1.95%, and 1.01% on exam, easy-exam, and accuracy, respectively. Moreover, a 2B-parameter model trained with our method surpasses the much larger GPT-4o by 3.28% on the exam metric.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassMem is a memory framework for LLMs that organizes memory as an Event Graph for structured navigation and improved long-horizon reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory mechanisms struggle with logical relationships and shallow retrieval, limiting long-horizon reasoning.

Method: CompassMem segments experiences into events and links them via logical relations in an Event Graph.

Result: Experiments show improved retrieval and reasoning performance on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA.

Conclusion: CompassMem enhances memory organization and reasoning for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent agents that reason, plan, and interact with their environments. To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.

TL;DR: Miner introduces a self-supervised method using intrinsic uncertainty as reward, improving efficiency in RL training for reasoning models with key innovations in credit assignment and advantage calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current critic-free RL methods waste rollouts on positive homogeneous prompts due to zero advantage estimates. Miner addresses this inefficiency without external supervision.

Method: Miner repurposes policy uncertainty as a reward signal, featuring token-level focal credit assignment and adaptive advantage calibration.

Result: Miner achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 4.58 Pass@1 and 6.66 Pass@K gains over GRPO across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Exploiting latent uncertainty is necessary and sufficient for efficient RL training of reasoning models.

Abstract: Current critic-free RL methods for large reasoning models suffer from severe inefficiency when training on positive homogeneous prompts (where all rollouts are correct), resulting in waste of rollouts due to zero advantage estimates. We introduce a radically simple yet powerful solution to \uline{M}ine \uline{in}trinsic mast\uline{er}y (Miner), that repurposes the policy's intrinsic uncertainty as a self-supervised reward signal, with no external supervision, auxiliary models, or additional inference cost. Our method pioneers two key innovations: (1) a token-level focal credit assignment mechanism that dynamically amplifies gradients on critical uncertain tokens while suppressing overconfident ones, and (2) adaptive advantage calibration to seamlessly integrate intrinsic and verifiable rewards. Evaluated across six reasoning benchmarks on Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B base models, Miner achieves state-of-the-art performance among the other four algorithms, yielding up to \textbf{4.58} absolute gains in Pass@1 and \textbf{6.66} gains in Pass@K compared to GRPO. Comparison with other methods targeted at exploration enhancement further discloses the superiority of the two newly proposed innovations. This demonstrates that latent uncertainty exploitation is both necessary and sufficient for efficient and scalable RL training of reasoning models.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing benchmarks that rely on multi-turn dialogues or synthetic histories, the authors propose a new benchmark built from autobiographical narratives to better assess person understanding.

Method: They reconstruct narratives into flashback-aware, time-anchored streams and evaluate models using evidence-linked questions covering factual recall, subjective states, and principle-level reasoning.

Result: Retrieval-augmented systems show improved factual accuracy but struggle with temporally grounded explanations and higher-level inferences, indicating the need for advanced memory mechanisms.

Conclusion: The benchmark emphasizes the importance of memory mechanisms beyond retrieval for deeper person understanding and provides publicly available data for further research.

Abstract: Existing long-horizon memory benchmarks mostly use multi-turn dialogues or synthetic user histories, which makes retrieval performance an imperfect proxy for person understanding. We present \BenchName, a publicly releasable benchmark built from long-form autobiographical narratives, where actions, context, and inner thoughts provide dense evidence for inferring stable motivations and decision principles. \BenchName~reconstructs each narrative into a flashback-aware, time-anchored stream and evaluates models with evidence-linked questions spanning factual recall, subjective state attribution, and principle-level reasoning. Across diverse narrative sources, retrieval-augmented systems mainly improve factual accuracy, while errors persist on temporally grounded explanations and higher-level inferences, highlighting the need for memory mechanisms beyond retrieval.

TL;DR: Orion-RAG uses a low-complexity strategy to link fragmented data, outperforming existing methods with a 25.2% precision improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG struggles with discrete, fragmented data lacking explicit links, making manual Knowledge Graphs impractical.

Method: Orion-RAG employs lightweight paths to naturally link related concepts across fragmented documents, avoiding heavy algorithms.

Result: Outperforms mainstream frameworks, supports real-time updates, and achieves a 25.2% precision improvement on FinanceBench.

Conclusion: Orion-RAG effectively transforms fragmented data into semi-structured form, enabling efficient information linkage and high performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective for knowledge synthesis, yet it encounters significant challenges in practical scenarios where data is inherently discrete and fragmented. In most environments, information is distributed across isolated files like reports and logs that lack explicit links. Standard search engines process files independently, ignoring the connections between them. Furthermore, manually building Knowledge Graphs is impractical for such vast data. To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency. Experiments on FinanceBench demonstrate superior precision with a 25.2% relative improvement over strong baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine LLM agents' capabilities in multi-turn tasks by addressing core challenges in agentic reinforcement learning.

Method: Introduces turn-level tree structures for exploration and credit assignment, with Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization for aligning policy updates.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements (up to 1.84 percentage points) over state-of-the-art baselines across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: AT$^2$PO effectively enhances multi-turn agentic RL performance and can be integrated into existing pipelines.

Abstract: LLM agents have emerged as powerful systems for tackling multi-turn tasks by interleaving internal reasoning and external tool interactions. Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT$^2$PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

TL;DR: SciIF is a benchmark introduced to evaluate LLMs' ability to follow scientific instructions rigorously, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on constraint adherence alongside correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks either focus on superficial formatting or final-answer correctness without ensuring scientific validity, creating a gap SciIF aims to fill.

Method: SciIF evaluates LLMs by pairing university-level problems with constraints across scientific conditions, semantic stability, and specific processes, emphasizing explicit evidence of adherence.

Result: SciIF enables fine-grained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring LLMs can operate reliably within scientific frameworks.

Conclusion: SciIF provides a robust standard for assessing LLMs' scientific instruction-following capabilities, promoting reliable scientific discovery.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from general knowledge retrieval to complex scientific discovery, their evaluation standards must also incorporate the rigorous norms of scientific inquiry. Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing poster generation methods lack interactivity and often misalign with user intent.

Method: APEX provides multi-level API-based editing and a review-and-adjustment mechanism, evaluated using APEX-Bench.

Result: APEX outperforms baseline methods in academic poster editing.

Conclusion: APEX advances poster editing with interactivity and fine-grained control, supported by a robust benchmark.

Abstract: Designing academic posters is a labor-intensive process requiring the precise balance of high-density content and sophisticated layout. While existing paper-to-poster generation methods automate initial drafting, they are typically single-pass and non-interactive, often fail to align with complex, subjective user intent. To bridge this gap, we propose APEX (Academic Poster Editing agentic eXpert), the first agentic framework for interactive academic poster editing, supporting fine-grained control with robust multi-level API-based editing and a review-and-adjustment Mechanism. In addition, we introduce APEX-Bench, the first systematic benchmark comprising 514 academic poster editing instructions, categorized by a multi-dimensional taxonomy including operation type, difficulty, and abstraction level, constructed via reference-guided and reference-free strategies to ensure realism and diversity. We further establish a multi-dimensional VLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess instruction fulfillment, modification scope, and visual consistency & harmony. Experimental results demonstrate that APEX significantly outperforms baseline methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Breesiu/APEX.

TL;DR: TNT reduces computational overhead in large reasoning models by dynamically adjusting token usage for non-thinking responses, achieving a 50% reduction in tokens while improving accuracy and minimizing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency and reward hacking issues in existing hybrid reasoning models that use RL or SFT, TNT proposes a novel approach leveraging thinking-based solutions.

Method: TNT avoids SFT and dynamically sets token limits for non-thinking responses by utilizing information from thinking-based solutions, ensuring efficient and accurate responses.

Result: TNT achieves a 50% reduction in token usage, improves accuracy, and keeps reward hacking probability below 10%, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: TNT provides an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency, effectively mitigating computational and reward hacking issues in large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have attracted much attention due to their exceptional performance. However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods. Additionally, the probability of reward hacking problem in TNT's responses, which are classified as not using thinking, remains below 10% across all tested datasets.

TL;DR: SCALER is a framework designed to sustain effective reinforcement learning signals for large language models by using adaptive environment design, scalable task synthesis, and dynamic difficulty adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slowdown in RL progress due to misaligned task difficulty and limited problem patterns, ensuring sustained improvement in reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes SCALER, featuring a scalable synthesis pipeline for generating diverse reasoning tasks with controllable difficulty and an adaptive RL strategy to dynamically adjust environments.

Result: SCALER outperforms dataset-based RL baselines across reasoning benchmarks and shows stable, long-term training dynamics.

Conclusion: SCALER effectively maintains learning signals and avoids common pitfalls like reward sparsity and overfitting, leading to better performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled way to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet its effectiveness hinges on training signals that remain informative as models evolve. In practice, RL progress often slows when task difficulty becomes poorly aligned with model capability, or when training is dominated by a narrow set of recurring problem patterns. To jointly address these issues, we propose SCALER (Synthetic sCalable Adaptive Learning Environment for Reasoning), a framework that sustains effective learning signals through adaptive environment design. SCALER introduces a scalable synthesis pipeline that converts real-world programming problems into verifiable reasoning environments with controllable difficulty and unbounded instance generation, enabling RL training beyond finite datasets while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Building on this, SCALER further employs an adaptive multi-environment RL strategy that dynamically adjusts instance difficulty and curates the active set of environments to track the model's capability frontier and maintain distributional diversity. This co-adaptation prevents reward sparsity, mitigates overfitting to narrow task patterns, and supports sustained improvement throughout training. Extensive experiments show that SCALER consistently outperforms dataset-based RL baselines across diverse reasoning benchmarks and exhibits more stable, long-horizon training dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates modern multimodal and vision-language models' ability to interpret AEC drawings using AECV-Bench, revealing strengths in OCR and text tasks but weaknesses in spatial reasoning and symbol-centric understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether current models can reliably interpret the complex graphical language of AEC drawings, focusing on practical use cases like object counting and document QA.

Method: The study introduces AECV-Bench, testing models on floor plan object counting and drawing-grounded QA tasks, using metrics like exact-match accuracy, MAPE, and LLM-as-a-judge scoring.

Result: Models excel in OCR and text-centric tasks (~95% accuracy) but struggle with spatial reasoning and symbol-centric tasks (40-55% accuracy), particularly counting doors and windows.

Conclusion: Current models are effective as document assistants but lack robust drawing literacy, suggesting the need for domain-specific tools and human-in-the-loop workflows.

Abstract: AEC drawings encode geometry and semantics through symbols, layout conventions, and dense annotation, yet it remains unclear whether modern multimodal and vision-language models can reliably interpret this graphical language. We present AECV-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal and vision-language models on realistic AEC artefacts via two complementary use cases: (i) object counting on 120 high-quality floor plans (doors, windows, bedrooms, toilets), and (ii) drawing-grounded document QA spanning 192 question-answer pairs that test text extraction (OCR), instance counting, spatial reasoning, and comparative reasoning over common drawing regions. Object-counting performance is reported using per-field exact-match accuracy and MAPE results, while document-QA performance is reported using overall accuracy and per-category breakdowns with an LLM-as-a-judge scoring pipeline and targeted human adjudication for edge cases. Evaluating a broad set of state-of-the-art models under a unified protocol, we observe a stable capability gradient; OCR and text-centric document QA are strongest (up to 0.95 accuracy), spatial reasoning is moderate, and symbol-centric drawing understanding - especially reliable counting of doors and windows - remains unsolved (often 0.40-0.55 accuracy) with substantial proportional errors. These results suggest that current systems function well as document assistants but lack robust drawing literacy, motivating domain-specific representations and tool-augmented, human-in-the-loop workflows for an efficient AEC automation.

TL;DR: DR-LoRA introduces dynamic rank allocation for LoRA in MoE LLMs, optimizing parameter efficiency by tailoring ranks to expert relevance, outperforming static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA approaches uniformly allocate ranks across experts in MoE LLMs, neglecting their functional specialization and causing resource mismatch.

Method: DR-LoRA dynamically adjusts LoRA ranks based on task-specific demands using an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism, prioritizing relevant experts.

Result: DR-LoRA outperforms standard LoRA and static strategies in benchmarks, offering better performance with efficient parameter use.

Conclusion: Dynamic rank allocation in DR-LoRA improves fine-tuning efficiency and task performance for MoE LLMs.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a prominent paradigm for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational inefficiencies in multi-agent systems due to uniform LLM deployment, ignoring varying cognitive demands in reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes OI-MAS with adaptive model-selection policy, state-dependent routing, and confidence-aware mechanisms to optimize model scales based on task complexity.

Result: Improves accuracy by up to 12.88% and reduces cost by up to 79.78% compared to baseline multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: OI-MAS effectively balances performance and cost by dynamically adapting model scales and agent roles.

Abstract: While multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated superior performance over single-agent approaches in complex reasoning tasks, they often suffer from significant computational inefficiencies. Existing frameworks typically deploy large language models (LLMs) uniformly across all agent roles, failing to account for the varying cognitive demands of different reasoning stages. We address this inefficiency by proposing OI-MAS framework, a novel multi-agent framework that implements an adaptive model-selection policy across a heterogeneous pool of multi-scale LLMs. Specifically, OI-MAS introduces a state-dependent routing mechanism that dynamically selects agent roles and model scales throughout the reasoning process. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism that selects appropriate model scales conditioned on task complexity, thus reducing unnecessary reliance on large-scale models. Experimental results show that OI-MAS consistently outperforms baseline multi-agent systems, improving accuracy by up to 12.88\% while reducing cost by up to 79.78\%.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Prompt-Prototype (ProP), a novel continual learning method that eliminates key-value pairs, reducing inter-task interference and improving scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based continual learning methods rely on key-value pairing, which introduces inter-task interference and scalability issues.

Method: The proposed approach uses task-specific prompts and prototypes to enhance feature learning and representative feature capture, with regularization constraints for stability.

Result: Experiments on standard datasets confirm the method's effectiveness, outperforming traditional prompt-based approaches.

Conclusion: ProP provides a scalable and interference-free solution for continual learning, opening new research directions.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to acquire new knowledge while retaining previously learned information. Prompt-based methods have shown remarkable performance in this domain; however, they typically rely on key-value pairing, which can introduce inter-task interference and hinder scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach employing task-specific Prompt-Prototype (ProP), thereby eliminating the need for key-value pairs. In our method, task-specific prompts facilitate more effective feature learning for the current task, while corresponding prototypes capture the representative features of the input. During inference, predictions are generated by binding each task-specific prompt with its associated prototype. Additionally, we introduce regularization constraints during prompt initialization to penalize excessively large values, thereby enhancing stability. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In contrast to mainstream prompt-based approaches, our framework removes the dependency on key-value pairs, offering a fresh perspective for future continual learning research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hypergraph-based method to enhance scientific reasoning by capturing higher-order interactions in knowledge representation, applied to biocomposite scaffolds with notable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like LLMs and KGs fall short in capturing complex, multi-entity interactions essential for scientific inquiry.

Method: Constructs hypergraph representations to encode multi-entity relationships, tested on a corpus of biocomposite scaffold manuscripts.

Result: Reveals a scale-free topology with highly connected hubs, enabling novel hypotheses like linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds.

Conclusion: Hypergraphs provide a verifiable, efficient way to uncover scientific relationships, advancing discovery beyond traditional graph methods.

Abstract: Scientific inquiry requires systems-level reasoning that integrates heterogeneous experimental data, cross-domain knowledge, and mechanistic evidence into coherent explanations. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a "teacherless" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods.

### [239] [Precomputing Multi-Agent Path Replanning using Temporal Flexibility: A Case Study on the Dutch Railway Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04884)
*Issa Hanou,Eric Kemmeren,Devin Wild Thomas,Mathijs de Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses replanning challenges in multi-agent systems when an agent is delayed, proposing FlexSIPP, an algorithm that leverages temporal flexibility to avoid cascading delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Delays in multi-agent plans can disrupt schedules, and traditional replanning methods are inefficient or infeasible.

Method: FlexSIPP precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, using temporal flexibility to minimize disruptions to other agents.

Result: FlexSIPP effectively replans within reasonable timeframes, as shown in a real-world railway network case study.

Conclusion: FlexSIPP offers a practical solution for replanning in multi-agent systems, avoiding cascading delays and maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Executing a multi-agent plan can be challenging when an agent is delayed, because this typically creates conflicts with other agents. So, we need to quickly find a new safe plan. Replanning only the delayed agent often does not result in an efficient plan, and sometimes cannot even yield a feasible plan. On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents. Our algorithm, FlexSIPP, precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, also returning the changes for the other agents, for any single-agent delay within the given scenario. We demonstrate our method in a real-world case study of replanning trains in the densely-used Dutch railway network. Our experiments show that FlexSIPP provides effective solutions, relevant to real-world adjustments, and within a reasonable timeframe.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach combining Colored-Timed Petri Nets (CTPNs) and actor-critic model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to optimize Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) by integrating AGVs and tool-sharing systems, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexities in FMS by integrating AGVs and tool-sharing systems, aiming to optimize production processes amidst dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach using CTPNs for formal modeling and dynamic action masking, combined with MBRL for adaptability. A lookahead strategy is added for optimal AGV positioning.

Result: The approach matches traditional methods on small benchmarks and outperforms them on larger ones, achieving better makespan and tenfold faster computation.

Conclusion: The novel method effectively optimizes FMS, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency, with reproducibility ensured through a gym-compatible environment and instance generator.

Abstract: Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) are pivotal in optimizing production processes in today's rapidly evolving manufacturing landscape. This paper advances the traditional job shop scheduling problem by incorporating additional complexities through the simultaneous integration of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and tool-sharing systems. We propose a novel approach that combines Colored-Timed Petri Nets (CTPNs) with actor-critic model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), effectively addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with FMS. CTPNs provide a formal modeling structure and dynamic action masking, significantly reducing the action search space, while MBRL ensures adaptability to changing environments through the learned policy. Leveraging the advantages of MBRL, we incorporate a lookahead strategy for optimal positioning of AGVs, improving operational efficiency. Our approach was evaluated on small-sized public benchmarks and a newly developed large-scale benchmark inspired by the Taillard benchmark. The results show that our approach matches traditional methods on smaller instances and outperforms them on larger ones in terms of makespan while achieving a tenfold reduction in computation time. To ensure reproducibility, we propose a gym-compatible environment and an instance generator. Additionally, an ablation study evaluates the contribution of each framework component to its overall performance.

*Tongyu Wen,Guanting Dong,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SmartSearch improves LLM-based search agents by enhancing the quality of intermediate search queries using process rewards and query refinement, achieving better performance than existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based search agents focus on reasoning paradigms but neglect query quality, leading to inaccurate retrieval results. SmartSearch aims to address this gap.

Method: SmartSearch uses process rewards for fine-grained supervision and query refinement to optimize query generation, implemented via a three-stage curriculum learning framework.

Result: Experiments show SmartSearch outperforms existing baselines, with significant improvements in search efficiency and query quality.

Conclusion: SmartSearch successfully enhances query quality in LLM-based search agents, demonstrating its effectiveness through superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based search agents have proven promising for addressing knowledge-intensive problems by incorporating information retrieval capabilities. Existing works largely focus on optimizing the reasoning paradigms of search agents, yet the quality of intermediate search queries during reasoning remains overlooked. As a result, the generated queries often remain inaccurate, leading to unexpected retrieval results and ultimately limiting search agents' overall effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce SmartSearch, a framework built upon two key mechanisms: (1) Process rewards, which provide fine-grained supervision for the quality of each intermediate search query through Dual-Level Credit Assessment. (2) Query refinement, which promotes the optimization of query generation by selectively refining low-quality search queries and regenerating subsequent search rounds based on these refinements. To enable the search agent to progressively internalize the ability to improve query quality under the guidance of process rewards, we design a three-stage curriculum learning framework. This framework guides the agent through a progression from imitation, to alignment, and ultimately to generalization. Experimental results show that SmartSearch consistently surpasses existing baselines, and additional quantitative analyses further confirm its significant gains in both search efficiency and query quality. The code is available at https://github.com/MYVAE/SmartSearch.

*Renzhao Liang,Jingru Chen,Bo Jia,Bo Deng,Chenggang Xie,Yidong Wang,Ke Jin,Xin Wang,Linfeng Zhang,Cunxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses variant contamination in LLM evaluations, where test items are memorized in altered forms, and introduces DVD, a detector using generation distribution variance to identify contamination effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of variant contamination in LLM evaluations, where existing methods fail to detect paraphrased or transformed test items memorized during training.

Method: The authors propose DVD, a single-sample detector that models local output distribution variance induced by temperature sampling, distinguishing contaminated items by their abnormal variance patterns.

Result: DVD outperforms existing baselines like perplexity-based methods, Min-$k$%++, CDD, and embedding-similarity techniques across datasets (Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA) and models (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1).

Conclusion: DVD establishes generation distribution variance as a reliable fingerprint for detecting variant contamination in LLM evaluations, offering robustness and practical utility.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is increasingly confounded by \emph{variant contamination}: the training corpus contains semantically equivalent yet lexically or syntactically altered versions of test items. Unlike verbatim leakage, these paraphrased or structurally transformed variants evade existing detectors based on sampling consistency or perplexity, thereby inflating benchmark scores via memorization rather than genuine reasoning. We formalize this problem and introduce \textbf{DVD} (\textbf{D}etection via \textbf{V}ariance of generation \textbf{D}istribution), a single-sample detector that models the local output distribution induced by temperature sampling. Our key insight is that contaminated items trigger alternation between a \emph{memory-adherence} state and a \emph{perturbation-drift} state, yielding abnormally high variance in the synthetic difficulty of low-probability tokens; uncontaminated items remain in drift with comparatively smooth variance. We construct the first benchmark for variant contamination across two domains Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA by generating and filtering semantically equivalent variants, and simulate contamination via fine-tuning models of different scales and architectures (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1). Across datasets and models, \textbf{DVD} consistently outperforms perplexity-based, Min-$k$\%++, edit-distance (CDD), and embedding-similarity baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness to hyperparameters. Our results establish variance of the generation distribution as a principled and practical fingerprint for detecting variant contamination in LLM evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces behaviour planning, a novel diverse planning approach integrating diversity models, and demonstrates its real-world applicability through three case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance diverse planning by incorporating explicit diversity models and supporting multiple planning categories, addressing real-world needs like storytelling, urban planning, and game evaluation.

Method: Behaviour planning, extending earlier methods with integrated diversity models, is applied in three case studies: storytelling, urban planning, and game evaluation.

Result: The approach proves effective in diverse real-world scenarios, showcasing its versatility and practicality.

Conclusion: Behaviour planning is a valuable tool for generating distinct plans across varied domains, supported by successful case studies.

Abstract: The primary objective of a diverse planning approach is to generate a set of plans that are distinct from one another. Such an approach is applied in a variety of real-world domains, including risk management, automated stream data analysis, and malware detection. More recently, a novel diverse planning paradigm, referred to as behaviour planning, has been proposed. This approach extends earlier methods by explicitly incorporating a diversity model into the planning process and supporting multiple planning categories. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of behaviour planning in real-world settings by presenting three case studies. The first case study focuses on storytelling, the second addresses urban planning, and the third examines game evaluation.

*Yildiz Uzun,Andrea Gauthier,Mutlu Cukurova*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores how conversational GenAI assistants integrated into LADs can support students with varying SRL levels, revealing distinct query patterns and highlighting areas for improvement in personalization and emotional handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance students' engagement with learning analytics feedback, especially for those with lower SRL competence, by leveraging conversational GenAI assistants.

Method: Analyzed authentic dialogues between students and a GenAI assistant integrated into LADs during a 10-week semester, focusing on query patterns, answer quality, and student perceptions.

Result: Low SRL students sought clarification, while high SRL students queried technical details. The assistant provided clear answers but lacked personalization and emotional support. GenAI was particularly beneficial for low SRL students.

Conclusion: GenAI assistants show promise in supporting SRL but require improvements in adaptivity, context-awareness, and technical refinement to enhance trust and effectiveness.

Abstract: Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) aim to support students' regulation of learning by translating complex data into feedback. Yet students, especially those with lower self-regulated learning (SRL) competence, often struggle to engage with and interpret analytics feedback. Conversational generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants have shown potential to scaffold this process through real-time, personalised, dialogue-based support. Further advancing this potential, we explored authentic dialogues between students and GenAI assistant integrated into LAD during a 10-week semester. The analysis focused on questions students with different SRL levels posed, the relevance and quality of the assistant's answers, and how students perceived the assistant's role in their learning. Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers. At the same time, students' reflections underscored the importance of trust, need for greater adaptivity, context-awareness, and technical refinement in future systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using ChatGPT (an LLM) for rapid prototyping in ESA's ELOPE competition, achieving second place despite joining late. It highlights AI's contributions (code, reasoning, suggestions) and limitations (errors, distractions) in scientific settings, advocating structured integration for enhanced prototyping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific discovery, specifically rapid prototyping for lunar lander trajectory estimation.

Method: Used ChatGPT for rapid prototyping in ESA's ELOPE competition, leveraging AI for code generation, algorithmic reasoning, and methodological suggestions.

Result: Achieved second place (score: 0.01282), showing effective AI-human collaboration. Identified strengths (e.g., reasoning) and limitations (e.g., errors) in using LLMs.

Conclusion: Structured integration of LLMs can accelerate scientific prototyping and conceptual insight, but best practices are needed to mitigate AI shortcomings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding partners, yet their role in accelerating scientific discovery remains underexplored. This paper presents a case study of using ChatGPT for rapid prototyping in ESA's ELOPE (Event-based Lunar OPtical flow Egomotion estimation) competition. The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing. At the same time, we observed limitations: the model often introduced unnecessary structural changes, gets confused by intermediate discussions about alternative ideas, occasionally produced critical errors and forgets important aspects in longer scientific discussions. By analyzing these strengths and shortcomings, we show how conversational AI can both accelerate development and support conceptual insight in scientific research. We argue that structured integration of LLMs into the scientific workflow can enhance rapid prototyping by proposing best practices for AI-assisted scientific work.

*Chunyu Wei,Huaiyu Qin,Siyuan He,Yunhai Wang,Yueguo Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T-Retriever introduces adaptive compression and semantic-structural entropy for hierarchical graph retrieval, outperforming existing RAG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph-based RAG methods struggle with rigid compression quotas and neglect semantic content, limiting their effectiveness in handling hierarchical information.

Method: T-Retriever uses adaptive compression encoding and semantic-structural entropy ($S^2$-Entropy) to optimize hierarchical graph retrieval while preserving structure and semantics.

Result: T-Retriever outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods in benchmarks, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant responses.

Conclusion: T-Retriever addresses limitations in hierarchical information retrieval by balancing structure and semantics, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced Large Language Models' ability to access external knowledge, yet current graph-based RAG approaches face two critical limitations in managing hierarchical information: they impose rigid layer-specific compression quotas that damage local graph structures, and they prioritize topological structure while neglecting semantic content. We introduce T-Retriever, a novel framework that reformulates attributed graph retrieval as tree-based retrieval using a semantic and structure-guided encoding tree. Our approach features two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Compression Encoding, which replaces artificial compression quotas with a global optimization strategy that preserves the graph's natural hierarchical organization, and (2) Semantic-Structural Entropy ($S^2$-Entropy), which jointly optimizes for both structural cohesion and semantic consistency when creating hierarchical partitions. Experiments across diverse graph reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that T-Retriever significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, providing more coherent and contextually relevant responses to complex queries.

### [247] [ConMax: Confidence-Maximizing Compression for Efficient Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04973)
*Minda Hu,Zexuan Qiu,Zenan Xu,Kun Li,Bo Zhou,Irwin King*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression) is a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes reasoning traces by pruning redundancy, balancing computational efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often generate redundant reasoning paths ('overthinking'), increasing costs without improving accuracy. Existing compression techniques compromise coherence or are costly.

Method: ConMax uses reinforcement learning to compress reasoning traces, maximizing answer confidence (predictive fidelity) and thinking confidence (reasoning validity) via a frozen auxiliary LRM.

Result: ConMax reduces inference length by 43% with only a 0.7% drop in accuracy across five reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: ConMax effectively balances efficiency and performance, generating high-quality training data for LRMs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated that extensive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation is critical for enabling intricate cognitive behaviors, such as self-verification and backtracking, to solve complex tasks. However, this capability often leads to ``overthinking'', where models generate redundant reasoning paths that inflate computational costs without improving accuracy. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces is a standard paradigm for the 'cold start' phase, applying existing compression techniques to these traces often compromises logical coherence or incurs prohibitive sampling costs. In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off. Specifically, it reduces inference length by 43% over strong baselines at the cost of a mere 0.7% dip in accuracy, proving its effectiveness in generating high-quality, efficient training data for LRMs.

TL;DR: AlgBench, a new benchmark curated by ACM experts, evaluates Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) on algorithmic reasoning, revealing significant performance gaps and uncovering strategic oversights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for algorithmic reasoning were limited, prompting the need for AlgBench to assess whether LRMs truly master algorithmic reasoning.

Method: AlgBench includes over 3,000 problems spanning 27 algorithms, categorized into Euclidean-structured, non-Euclidean-structured, non-optimized, local-optimized, global-optimized, and heuristic-optimized tasks.

Result: Leading LRMs show high accuracy (92%) on non-optimized tasks but struggle (49%) on globally optimized algorithms like dynamic programming, revealing strategic oversights.

Conclusion: The findings highlight limitations in problem-centric reinforcement learning and advocate for an algorithm-centric training paradigm to improve LRMs' algorithmic reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a central focus in the advancement of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Although notable progress has been achieved on several reasoning benchmarks such as MATH500 and LiveCodeBench, existing benchmarks for algorithmic reasoning remain limited, failing to answer a critical question: Do LRMs truly master algorithmic reasoning? To answer this question, we propose AlgBench, an expert-curated benchmark that evaluates LRMs under an algorithm-centric paradigm.
  AlgBench consists of over 3,000 original problems spanning 27 algorithms, constructed by ACM algorithmic experts and organized under a comprehensive taxonomy, including Euclidean-structured, non-Euclidean-structured, non-optimized, local-optimized, global-optimized, and heuristic-optimized categories. Empirical evaluations on leading LRMs (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro, DeepSeek-v3.2-Speciale and GPT-o3) reveal substantial performance heterogeneity: while models perform well on non-optimized tasks (up to 92%), accuracy drops sharply to around 49% on globally optimized algorithms such as dynamic programming. Further analysis uncovers \textbf{strategic over-shifts}, wherein models prematurely abandon correct algorithmic designs due to necessary low-entropy tokens. These findings expose fundamental limitations of problem-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the necessity of an algorithm-centric training paradigm for robust algorithmic reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore LLM limitations in handling distorted tabular data and their reliance on explicit prompts for error correction.

Method: Introduce a curated dataset for TQA tasks requiring error-correction steps, testing LLM performance under distortion.

Result: LLMs lack inherent distortion detection; explicit prompts help partially but not consistently (22% accuracy drop for GPT-5.2).

Conclusion: Highlights the need for research on LLMs' autonomous tabular data realignment, mimicking human-like behavior without prompts.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when tabular data in an otherwise canonical representation is subjected to semantic and structural distortions. Our findings reveal that LLMs lack an inherent ability to detect and correct subtle distortions in table representations. Only when provided with an explicit prior, via a system prompt, do models partially adjust their reasoning strategies and correct some distortions, though not consistently or completely. To study this phenomenon, we introduce a small, expert-curated dataset that explicitly evaluates LLMs on table question answering (TQA) tasks requiring an additional error-correction step prior to analysis. Our results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs ingest and interpret tabular information under distortion, with even SoTA models such as GPT-5.2 model exhibiting a drop of minimum 22% accuracy under distortion. These findings raise important questions for future research, particularly regarding when and how models should autonomously decide to realign tabular inputs, analogous to human behavior, without relying on explicit prompts or tabular data pre-processing.

TL;DR: OptiSet is a set-centric framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation that enhances evidence selection by considering combinatorial gains and reducing redundancy, outperforming traditional top-k methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for RAG often fail to leverage combinatorial gains among passages and introduce redundancy by statically selecting top-k passages.

Method: OptiSet uses an 'Expand-then-Refine' paradigm, self-synthesis for preference labels, and a set-list wise training strategy to optimize evidence selection and ranking.

Result: OptiSet improves performance on complex combinatorial problems and increases generation efficiency.

Conclusion: OptiSet's unified approach to set selection and ranking effectively addresses redundancy and enhances retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves generation quality by incorporating evidence retrieved from large external corpora. However, most existing methods rely on statically selecting top-k passages based on individual relevance, which fails to exploit combinatorial gains among passages and often introduces substantial redundancy. To address this limitation, we propose OptiSet, a set-centric framework that unifies set selection and set-level ranking for RAG. OptiSet adopts an "Expand-then-Refine" paradigm: it first expands a query into multiple perspectives to enable a diverse candidate pool and then refines the candidate pool via re-selection to form a compact evidence set. We then devise a self-synthesis strategy without strong LLM supervision to derive preference labels from the set conditional utility changes of the generator, thereby identifying complementary and redundant evidence. Finally, we introduce a set-list wise training strategy that jointly optimizes set selection and set-level ranking, enabling the model to favor compact, high-gain evidence sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiSet improves performance on complex combinatorial problems and makes generation more efficient. The source code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper revises the Critical Batch Size concept for the Warmup-Stable-Decay scheduler, introducing a new E(S) relationship, minimum batch size (B_min), optimal batch size (B_opt), and a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler to improve training efficiency and model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original Critical Batch Size framework doesn't align with the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) scheduler, creating a gap between theory and practice in large-scale pre-training.

Method: The paper derives a revised E(S) relationship for WSD, identifies B_min and B_opt, and proposes a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler.

Result: Experiments show the revised formula accurately captures pre-training dynamics, and the scheduler improves efficiency and model quality.

Conclusion: The revised framework and scheduler bridge the theory-practice gap, enhancing large-scale pre-training under WSD.

Abstract: The concept of Critical Batch Size, as pioneered by OpenAI, has long served as a foundational principle for large-scale pre-training. However, with the paradigm shift towards the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler, we observe that the original theoretical framework and its underlying mechanisms fail to align with new pre-training dynamics. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper derives a revised E(S) relationship tailored for WSD scheduler, characterizing the trade-off between training data consumption E and steps S during pre-training. Our theoretical analysis reveals two fundamental properties of WSD-based pre-training: 1) B_min, the minimum batch size threshold required to achieve a target loss, and 2) B_opt, the optimal batch size that maximizes data efficiency by minimizing total tokens. Building upon these properties, we propose a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our revised formula precisely captures the dynamics of large-scale pre-training, and the resulting scheduling strategy significantly enhances both training efficiency and final model quality.

TL;DR: The paper explores optimal learning rate configuration for large-scale pre-training, introducing two paradigms (Fitting and Transfer) to improve efficiency and scalability, while challenging existing methods like μTransfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of configuring learning rates efficiently in large-scale pre-training, balancing cost and performance by leveraging low-cost experiments.

Method: The paper proposes two paradigms: Fitting reduces search complexity using predictive modeling, while Transfer extends μTransfer principles to MoE architectures, covering model depth, weight decay, and token horizons.

Result: Empirical results challenge μTransfer's scalability in large-scale pre-training and analyze module-wise tuning's underperformance via training stability and feature learning.

Conclusion: The work provides practical guidelines and theoretical insights for optimizing industrial-level pre-training, advancing hyperparameter research.

Abstract: Optimal configuration of the learning rate (LR) is a fundamental yet formidable challenge in large-scale pre-training. Given the stringent trade-off between training costs and model performance, the pivotal question is whether the optimal LR can be accurately extrapolated from low-cost experiments. In this paper, we formalize this investigation into two distinct research paradigms: Fitting and Transfer. Within the Fitting Paradigm, we innovatively introduce a Scaling Law for search factor, effectively reducing the search complexity from O(n^3) to O(n*C_D*C_η) via predictive modeling. Within the Transfer Paradigm, we extend the principles of $μ$Transfer to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, broadening its applicability to encompass model depth, weight decay, and token horizons. By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms. Our empirical results challenge the scalability of the widely adopted $μ$ Transfer in large-scale pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis through the dual lenses of training stability and feature learning to elucidate the underlying reasons why module-wise parameter tuning underperforms in large-scale settings. This work offers systematic practical guidelines and a fresh theoretical perspective for optimizing industrial-level pre-training.

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT-4o can equally promote or debunk conspiracy theories, with or without guardrails, but corrective measures like accuracy prompts can mitigate risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs' persuasive power favors truth over falsehood or equally promotes misbeliefs.

Method: Three pre-registered experiments tested GPT-4o's ability to argue for or against conspiracy theories with 2,724 American participants.

Result: LLMs were equally effective at increasing or decreasing conspiracy beliefs, even without guardrails. Corrective measures reversed false beliefs.

Conclusion: LLMs can promote both truth and falsehood, but solutions like accuracy prompts can reduce risks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be persuasive across a variety of context. But it remains unclear whether this persuasive power advantages truth over falsehood, or if LLMs can promote misbeliefs just as easily as refuting them. Here, we investigate this question across three pre-registered experiments in which participants (N = 2,724 Americans) discussed a conspiracy theory they were uncertain about with GPT-4o, and the model was instructed to either argue against ("debunking") or for ("bunking") that conspiracy. When using a "jailbroken" GPT-4o variant with guardrails removed, the AI was as effective at increasing conspiracy belief as decreasing it. Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to revent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs possess potent abilities to promote both truth and falsehood, but that potential solutions may exist to help mitigate this risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reuse of scientific reviews by transforming narrative text and static tables into structured, queryable knowledge.

Method: Publishing review tables as FAIR, machine-actionable comparisons in ORKG and comparing symbolic querying with LLM-based querying.

Result: Successfully integrated ALD/E review tables into ORKG, highlighting the reliability of symbolic querying over LLMs.

Conclusion: A curated symbolic layer should underpin neurosymbolic AI in materials science, with LLMs as symbolically grounded interfaces.

Abstract: Scientific reviews are central to knowledge integration in materials science, yet their key insights remain locked in narrative text and static PDF tables, limiting reuse by humans and machines alike. This article presents a case study in atomic layer deposition and etching (ALD/E) where we publish review tables as FAIR, machine-actionable comparisons in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), turning them into structured, queryable knowledge. Building on this, we contrast symbolic querying over ORKG with large language model-based querying, and argue that a curated symbolic layer should remain the backbone of reliable neurosymbolic AI in materials science, with LLMs serving as complementary, symbolically grounded interfaces rather than standalone sources of truth.

*Quentin Garrido,Tushar Nagarajan,Basile Terver,Nicolas Ballas,Yann LeCun,Michael Rabbat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores learning latent action models from diverse, real-world videos to enable agents to predict action consequences without explicit action labels, addressing challenges like noise and lack of common embodiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for agents to predict action consequences in real-world scenarios without relying on complex action labels, which are hard to obtain at scale.

Method: Proposes learning latent action models from videos, emphasizing continuous, constrained latent actions over vector quantization, and introducing architectural choices and evaluations to handle video diversity.

Result: Demonstrates that continuous latent actions capture complex real-world actions better than vector quantization, enabling transfer of agent-induced changes across videos and localized action learning relative to the camera.

Conclusion: The approach advances scaling latent action models for real-world applications, showing potential for universal action interfaces and planning tasks with performance comparable to action-conditioned baselines.

Abstract: Agents capable of reasoning and planning in the real world require the ability of predicting the consequences of their actions. While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.

TL;DR: ROSE enhances reasoning in LLMs by promoting diverse exploration and efficient reasoning through semantic-entropy branching and ε-exploration, validated on mathematical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods like GRPO lack exploration diversity and reasoning efficiency, prompting the need for improved techniques.

Method: ROSE uses semantic-entropy-based branching and ε-exploration for diverse reasoning, along with a length-aware advantage estimator for efficiency.

Result: Experiments with Qwen and Llama models on mathematical benchmarks confirm ROSE's effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: ROSE addresses diversity and efficiency challenges in RLVR, offering a robust solution for LLM reasoning enhancement.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning of large language models (LLMs). Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based extensions improve upon vanilla RLVR (e.g., GRPO) by providing tree-based reasoning rollouts that enable fine-grained and segment-level credit assignment. However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy risks in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) due to leaked PII in intermediate reasoning steps and proposes methods to enable privacy-first reasoning without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to mitigate privacy risks introduced by transparent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LRMs, which often leaks sensitive personal information (PII) even when final answers are sanitized.

Method: The authors introduce PII-CoT-Bench, a dataset with privacy-aware CoT annotations, and evaluate deployable interventions like prompt-based controls and fine-tuning across models.

Result: Results show state-of-the-art models benefit from prompt-based controls, while weaker models require fine-tuning. Both methods significantly reduce PII exposure with minimal utility loss.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that private CoT reasoning is achievable with minimal performance degradation, offering practical solutions for privacy-preserving reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve performance, reliability, and interpretability by generating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but this transparency introduces a serious privacy risk: intermediate reasoning often leaks personally identifiable information (PII) even when final answers are sanitized. We study how to induce privacy-first reasoning, where models reason without exposing sensitive information, using deployable interventions rather than post-hoc redaction. We introduce PII-CoT-Bench, a supervised dataset with privacy-aware CoT annotations, and a category-balanced evaluation benchmark covering realistic and adversarial leakage scenarios. Our results reveal a capability-dependent trend: state-of-the-art models benefit most from prompt-based controls, whereas weaker models require fine-tuning to achieve meaningful leakage reduction. Across models and categories, both approaches substantially reduce PII exposure with minimal degradation in utility, demonstrating that private reasoning can be achieved without sacrificing performance. Overall, we show that private CoT reasoning can be achieved with minimal utility loss, providing practical guidance for building privacy-preserving reasoning systems.

*Konstantin Kubrak,Ahmed El-Moselhy,Ammar Alsulami,Remaz Altuwaim,Hassan Ismail Fawaz,Faisal Alsaby*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first benchmark for evaluating Arabic LLMs' tool-calling and agentic capabilities, revealing significant accuracy drops when users interact in Arabic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of benchmarks for Arabic LLMs, especially in tool-calling, prompted the creation of a standardized framework to assess their performance in Arabic workflows.

Method: The authors developed a dedicated benchmark to evaluate tool-calling accuracy and robustness of Arabic LLMs in agentic tasks.

Result: The benchmark showed a 5-10% drop in tool-calling accuracy when users interacted in Arabic compared to English, regardless of tool description language.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better Arabic-native LLM evaluation tools to improve reliability and linguistic equity for Arabic-speaking users.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral to numerous industries, increasingly serving as the core reasoning engine for autonomous agents that perform complex tasks through tool-use. While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users.

### [259] [Token-Level LLM Collaboration via FusionRoute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05106)
*Nuoya Xiong,Yuhang Zhou,Hanqing Zeng,Zhaorun Chen,Furong Huang,Shuchao Bi,Lizhu Zhang,Zhuokai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FusionRoute is a token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework that combines expert selection with a complementary generator to improve generalization and efficiency, outperforming existing methods across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dilemma of balancing general-purpose LLMs' high costs with domain-specialized models' limited generalization inspired the development of FusionRoute.

Method: FusionRoute uses a lightweight router to select domain experts at each decoding step and adds complementary logits to refine the expert's output. Theoretical analysis supports the need for this hybrid approach.

Result: Empirical results show FusionRoute outperforms sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts.

Conclusion: FusionRoute effectively addresses the trade-off between generalizability and efficiency in LLMs, offering a robust solution for multi-domain tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strengths across diverse domains. However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.

TL;DR: SteeM (Steerable Memory Agent) enables dynamic control of memory reliance in LLM-based agents, balancing innovation and historical consistency, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing memory usage in LLM-based agents, which either trap the agent in past interactions (Memory Anchoring) or lose important history.

Method: Introduce a behavioral metric for memory dependence and propose SteeM, a framework allowing dynamic regulation of memory reliance.

Result: SteeM outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking, offering nuanced control for personalized human-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: Dynamic memory regulation is key for effective, personalized long-term interactions with LLM-based agents.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly used in long-term interactions, cumulative memory is critical for enabling personalization and maintaining stylistic consistency. However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to \textit{Memory Anchoring}, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs. We then propose \textbf{Stee}rable \textbf{M}emory Agent, \texttt{SteeM}, a framework that allows users to dynamically regulate memory reliance, ranging from a fresh-start mode that promotes innovation to a high-fidelity mode that closely follows interaction history. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking strategies, yielding a more nuanced and effective control for personalized human-agent collaboration.

### [261] [GlimpRouter: Efficient Collaborative Inference by Glimpsing One Token of Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05110)
*Wenhao Zeng,Xuteng Zhang,Yuling Shi,Chao Hu,Yuting Chen,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GlimpRouter reduces inference latency and computational costs in Large Reasoning Models by routing tasks based on the difficulty inferred from the entropy of the initial token of each reasoning step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models incur high inference latency and computational costs due to multi-step reasoning. Collaborative inference between lightweight and large models could mitigate this, but existing routing strategies introduce overhead.

Method: Proposed GlimpRouter, a training-free framework that uses the entropy of the first token of a reasoning step to predict difficulty and route tasks between models accordingly.

Result: Achieved a 10.7% accuracy improvement and reduced inference latency by 25.9% compared to standalone large models on AIME25.

Conclusion: GlimpRouter demonstrates that initial token entropy is a simple yet effective predictor of step difficulty, enabling efficient computation allocation.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by explicitly generating multi-step chains of thought, but this capability incurs substantial inference latency and computational cost. Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the "Aha Moment" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25. These results suggest a simple yet effective mechanism for reasoning: allocating computation based on a glimpse of thought rather than full-step evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-as-judge systems show low inter-judge agreement but high individual consistency, revealing distinct evaluative dispositions rather than shared quality standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reliability and consistency of LLM-based judges in evaluation tasks, uncovering hidden patterns in their disagreement.

Method: Analyzed 3,240 evaluations across 9 judges and 120 unique video items, measuring inter-judge agreement (Krippendorff's α) and using classifiers to identify judge-specific patterns.

Result: Near-zero inter-judge agreement (α = 0.042), with judges exhibiting distinct, stable evaluative dispositions (identifiable with up to 99.6% accuracy within model families).

Conclusion: LLM judges are not interchangeable; they encode unique theories of quality, making averaged scores meaningless as they reflect no single judge's values.

Abstract: LLM-as-judge systems promise scalable, consistent evaluation. We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's α = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (α < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an "evaluative disposition" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality. Averaging their scores produces a synthetic verdict that corresponds to no judge's actual values.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReasonMark is a new watermarking framework for reasoning LLMs that balances robustness and logical integrity by decoupling generation phases and using semantic-adaptive modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods disrupt reasoning coherence or add high computational costs, hindering their use for reasoning-intensive LLMs.

Method: ReasonMark splits generation into Thinking and Answering phases, using a Criticality Score and Principal Semantic Vector (PSV) to guide watermarking without logical disruption.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with better text quality (lower Perplexity, higher BLEU), accuracy (+0.67), and robustness (+0.34% AUC), with minimal latency.

Conclusion: ReasonMark enables reliable deployment of reasoning LLMs by ensuring traceability and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) excelling in complex tasks present unique challenges for digital watermarking, as existing methods often disrupt logical coherence or incur high computational costs. Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity. Extensive experiments show ReasonMark surpasses state-of-the-art methods by reducing text Perplexity by 0.35, increasing translation BLEU score by 0.164, and raising mathematical accuracy by 0.67 points. These advancements are achieved alongside a 0.34% higher watermark detection AUC and stronger robustness to attacks, all with a negligible increase in latency. This work enables the traceable and trustworthy deployment of reasoning LLMs in real-world applications.

*Yaxuan Wang,Zhongteng Cai,Yujia Bao,Xueru Zhang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the self-consuming performative loop (SCPL) in LLMs, where synthetic data training causes bias. It proposes a reward-based rejection sampling strategy to mitigate this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how synthetic data in LLMs creates self-consuming loops, leading to performance drops and biases, and to address these issues in a controlled setting.

Method: Introduces SCPL and investigates bias evolution in two training loops (retraining and incremental fine-tuning) using controlled performative feedback. Tests on three real-world tasks and proposes a reward-based rejection sampling strategy.

Result: Performative loops increase preference bias but reduce disparate bias. The reward-based strategy effectively mitigates bias.

Conclusion: The study highlights bias risks in self-consuming loops and offers a solution to improve trust in self-improving systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to growing interest in using synthetic data to train future models. However, this creates a self-consuming retraining loop, where models are trained on their own outputs and may cause performance drops and induce emerging biases. In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{C}onsuming \textbf{P}erformative \textbf{L}oop (\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback. This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner. We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored. Through experiments on three real-world tasks, we find that the performative loop increases preference bias and decreases disparate bias. We design a reward-based rejection sampling strategy to mitigate the bias, moving towards more trustworthy self-improving systems.

Motivation: To explore the underutilized potential of LLMs in graph-oriented engineering workflows and provide a privacy-preserving, cost-effective solution for industrial model-driven engineering.

Method: Introduces SimuAgent, a two-stage trained LLM-powered agent using a lightweight plan-execute architecture and Reflection-GRPO for sparse reward tasks, with abstract-reconstruct data augmentation.

Result: Outperforms standard RL baselines and GPT-4o in modeling accuracy and convergence speed on SimuBench, a new benchmark with 5300 tasks.

Conclusion: SimuAgent successfully bridges LLMs and graphical modeling environments, offering a practical AI-assisted engineering design solution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-based code automation, but their potential in graph-oriented engineering workflows remains under-explored. We introduce SimuAgent, an LLM-powered modeling and simulation agent tailored for Simulink. SimuAgent replaces verbose XML with a concise, dictionary-style Python representation, dramatically cutting token counts, improving interpretability, and enabling fast, in-process simulation. A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark. Ablations confirm that the two-stage curriculum and abstract-reconstruct data augmentation further enhance generalization. SimuAgent trains and runs entirely on-premise with modest hardware, delivering a privacy-preserving, cost-effective solution for industrial model-driven engineering. SimuAgent bridges the gap between LLMs and graphical modeling environments, offering a practical solution for AI-assisted engineering design in industrial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing statistical methods inadequately forecast stock price ranges, prompting the need for a more accurate approach.

Method: Uses Z-score normalization, missing value imputation, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to extract hidden patterns and improve predictions.

Result: NP-DNN achieves 99.21% accuracy, surpassing other models like Fused Large Language Model.

Conclusion: NP-DNN is highly effective for stock market price prediction, leveraging deep learning for superior accuracy.

Abstract: Stock market price prediction is a significant interdisciplinary research domain that depends at the intersection of finance, statistics, and economics. Forecasting Accurately predicting stock prices has always been a focal point for various researchers. However, existing statistical approaches for time-series prediction often fail to effectively forecast the probability range of future stock prices. Hence, to solve this problem, the Neural Prophet with a Deep Neural Network (NP-DNN) is proposed to predict stock market prices. The preprocessing technique used in this research is Z-score normalization, which normalizes stock price data by removing scale differences, making patterns easier to detect. Missing value imputation fills gaps in historical data, enhancing the models use of complete information for more accurate predictions. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) learns complex nonlinear relationships among stock market prices and extracts hidden patterns from the input data, thereby creating meaningful feature representations for better prediction accuracy. The proposed NP-DNN model achieved an accuracy of 99.21% compared with other approaches using the Fused Large Language Model.

TL;DR: A framework for detecting hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) tool usage during a single forward pass, ensuring real-time efficiency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate by selecting incorrect tools or malformed parameters, bypassing systems and causing unreliable results, requiring early detection.

Method: Leverages LLMs' internal representations in the same forward pass used for generation to detect hallucinations computationally efficiently.

Result: Achieves up to 86.4% accuracy in detecting tool-calling hallucinations, excelling at parameter-level errors and inappropriate tool selections.

Conclusion: The framework enhances LLM agent reliability with minimal computational overhead, critical for production deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in tool calling and tool usage, but suffer from hallucinations where they choose incorrect tools, provide malformed parameters and exhibit 'tool bypass' behavior by performing simulations and generating outputs instead of invoking specialized tools or external systems. This undermines the reliability of LLM based agents in production systems as it leads to inconsistent results, and bypasses security and audit controls. Such hallucinations in agent tool selection require early detection and error handling. Unlike existing hallucination detection methods that require multiple forward passes or external validation, we present a computationally efficient framework that detects tool-calling hallucinations in real-time by leveraging LLMs' internal representations during the same forward pass used for generation. We evaluate this approach on reasoning tasks across multiple domains, demonstrating strong detection performance (up to 86.4\% accuracy) while maintaining real-time inference capabilities with minimal computational overhead, particularly excelling at detecting parameter-level hallucinations and inappropriate tool selections, critical for reliable agent deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a transparent and reproducible evaluation framework for memory-aware LLM agents in open-world Minecraft, moving beyond synthetic prompts.

Method: Tasks are co-authored with expert players, normalized into templates, and validated under bounded-knowledge policies. The harness captures agent interactions and outcomes.

Result: Evaluation of 216 subtasks revealed breakdowns in execution and navigation but showed recovery via clarifications and memory. Participants praised usability but noted memory persistence issues.

Conclusion: MineNPC-Task provides a robust framework for evaluating embodied agents, with released tools encouraging future research.

Abstract: We present \textsc{MineNPC-Task}, a user-authored benchmark and evaluation harness for testing memory-aware, mixed-initiative LLM agents in open-world \emph{Minecraft}. Rather than relying on synthetic prompts, tasks are elicited from formative and summative co-play with expert players, normalized into parametric templates with explicit preconditions and dependency structure, and paired with machine-checkable validators under a bounded-knowledge policy that forbids out-of-world shortcuts. The harness captures plan/act/memory events-including plan previews, targeted clarifications, memory reads and writes, precondition checks, and repair attempts and reports outcomes relative to the total number of attempted subtasks, derived from in-world evidence.
  As an initial snapshot, we instantiate the framework with GPT-4o and evaluate \textbf{216} subtasks across \textbf{8} experienced players. We observe recurring breakdown patterns in code execution, inventory/tool handling, referencing, and navigation, alongside recoveries supported by mixed-initiative clarifications and lightweight memory. Participants rated interaction quality and interface usability positively, while highlighting the need for stronger memory persistence across tasks. We release the complete task suite, validators, logs, and harness to support transparent, reproducible evaluation of future memory-aware embodied agents.

Motivation: Despite the progress of Medical MLLMs in medical tasks, their safety has been under-researched, posing risks for real-world deployment. This gap motivates the need for a systematic safety evaluation and mitigation strategy.

This involves extracting intrinsic safety knowledge from base models and injecting it into target models, alongside a fine-grained parameter search algorithm for optimal safety-medical performance trade-offs.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves safety in Medical MLLMs without additional safety data and minimizes degradation in core medical performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the safety risks in Medical MLLMs and presents an effective strategy for re-aligning safety, ensuring safer deployment while maintaining medical efficacy.

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Medical MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in specialized medical tasks; however, research into their safety has lagged, posing potential risks for real-world deployment. In this paper, we first establish a multidimensional evaluation framework to systematically benchmark the safety of current SOTA Medical MLLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across both general and medical-specific safety dimensions in existing models, particularly highlighting their fragility against cross-modality jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we find that the medical fine-tuning process frequently induces catastrophic forgetting of the model's original safety alignment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel "Parameter-Space Intervention" approach for efficient safety re-alignment. This method extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and concurrently injects them into the target model during the construction of medical capabilities. Additionally, we design a fine-grained parameter search algorithm to achieve an optimal trade-off between safety and medical performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bolsters the safety guardrails of Medical MLLMs without relying on additional domain-specific safety data, while minimizing degradation to core medical performance.

### [270] [Green MLOps: Closed-Loop, Energy-Aware Inference with NVIDIA Triton, FastAPI, and Bio-Inspired Thresholding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04250)
*Mustapha Hamdi,Mourad Jabou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A bio-inspired framework improves energy efficiency in AI inference by using a closed-loop threshold to admit requests only when utility-to-energy trade-offs are favorable, reducing processing time by 42% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy efficiency in AI deployment is crucial due to the cumulative carbon impact of long-running inference, prompting the need for solutions that balance performance and energy use.

Method: The proposed bio-inspired framework maps protein-folding energy basins to inference cost landscapes, controlling execution via a decaying closed-loop threshold to optimize utility-to-energy trade-offs.

Result: Tests on DistilBERT and ResNet-18 show a 42% reduction in processing time (0.50s vs 0.29s) with less than 0.5% accuracy degradation compared to standard open-loop execution.

Conclusion: The framework connects biophysical energy models to Green MLOps, offering a practical and auditable approach for energy-aware inference in production.

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a first-order concern in AI deployment, as long-running inference can exceed training in cumulative carbon impact. We propose a bio-inspired framework that maps protein-folding energy basins to inference cost landscapes and controls execution via a decaying, closed-loop threshold. A request is admitted only when the expected utility-to-energy trade-off is favorable (high confidence/utility at low marginal energy and congestion), biasing operation toward the first acceptable local basin rather than pursuing costly global minima. We evaluate DistilBERT and ResNet-18 served through FastAPI with ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA Triton on an RTX 4000 Ada GPU. Our ablation study reveals that the bio-controller reduces processing time by 42% compared to standard open-loop execution (0.50s vs 0.29s on A100 test set), with a minimal accuracy degradation (<0.5%). Furthermore, we establish the efficiency boundaries between lightweight local serving (ORT) and managed batching (Triton). The results connect biophysical energy models to Green MLOps and offer a practical, auditable basis for closed-loop energy-aware inference in production.

### [271] [Safety-Utility Conflicts Are Not Global: Surgical Alignment via Head-Level Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04262)
*Wang Cai,Yilin Wen,Jinchang Hou,Du Su,Guoqiu Wang,Zhonghou Lv,Chenfu Bao,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAST, a framework for improving safety alignment in LLMs by addressing modular heterogeneity in Transformers, using selective updates based on conflict maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for safety alignment in LLMs overlook modular heterogeneity in Transformers, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between safety and general capabilities. The authors aim to address this by focusing on head-level conflicts and sensitivities.

Method: Proposed Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), which constructs a pre-alignment conflict map to identify high-conflict heads. CAST selectively updates parameters, skipping problematic heads to preserve general capabilities.

Result: Experiments show alignment conflicts are non-uniformly distributed, and updating high-conflict heads degrades capabilities. CAST reduces this loss without compromising safety.

Conclusion: CAST offers an interpretable and parameter-efficient solution for improving the safety-utility trade-off in LLMs by addressing head-level conflicts.

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently presents a multi-objective optimization conflict, often accompanied by an unintended degradation of general capabilities. Existing mitigation strategies typically rely on global gradient geometry to resolve these conflicts, yet they overlook Modular Heterogeneity within Transformers, specifically that the functional sensitivity and degree of conflict vary substantially across different attention heads. Such global approaches impose uniform update rules across all parameters, often resulting in suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility sensitive heads that exhibit intense gradient conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), a framework that integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning. CAST first constructs a pre-alignment conflict map by synthesizing Optimization Conflict and Functional Sensitivity, which then guides the selective update of parameters. Experiments reveal that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed. We find that the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of ``high-conflict'' heads. By simply skipping these heads during training, we significantly reduce this loss without compromising safety, offering an interpretable and parameter-efficient approach to improving the safety-utility trade-off.

### [272] [Learning to Reason: Temporal Saliency Distillation for Interpretable Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04263)
*Nilushika Udayangani Hewa Dehigahawattage,Kishor Nandakishor,Marimuthu Palaniswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Temporal Saliency Distillation (TSD) for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series, addressing limitations of current methods by transferring teacher reasoning alongside predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods for time series lack interpretability and transfer limited knowledge, hindering student models' ability to replicate teacher predictions accurately.

Method: TSD extends logit transfer to include temporal saliency, capturing the importance of input timesteps, encouraging students to mimic teacher reasoning without extra parameters.

Result: TSD improves baseline performance and achieves properties beyond accuracy, enhancing interpretability and alignment with teacher predictions.

Conclusion: TSD offers a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series, demonstrating effectiveness over traditional methods.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has proven effective for model compression by transferring knowledge from a larger network called the teacher to a smaller network called the student. Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions. We demonstrate that Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves the performance of baseline methods while also achieving desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy. We hope our work establishes a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series analysis.

### [273] [Online Action-Stacking Improves Reinforcement Learning Performance for Air Traffic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04287)
*Ben Carvell,George De Ath,Eseoghene Benjamin,Richard Everson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online action-stacking improves reinforcement learning for air traffic control by simplifying training with discrete actions and compiling them into realistic commands at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between standard RL formulations and operational ATC requirements by simplifying training while maintaining realistic command output.

Method: Uses Proximal Policy Optimisation with a small discrete action space and action-damping penalty, then compiles primitive actions into compound clearances at inference.

Result: Action-stacking reduces instruction frequency and matches performance of policies trained with larger action spaces.

Conclusion: Online action-stacking effectively scales RL for complex ATC scenarios while simplifying training.

Abstract: We introduce online action-stacking, an inference-time wrapper for reinforcement learning policies that produces realistic air traffic control commands while allowing training on a much smaller discrete action space. Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency and leads agents to issue commands in short bursts. At inference, online action-stacking compiles these bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation and the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, we train agents to navigate aircraft along lateral routes, manage climb and descent to target flight levels, and perform two-aircraft collision avoidance under a minimum separation constraint. In our lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions. These results indicate that online action-stacking helps bridge a key gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.

### [274] [MemKD: Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04264)
*Nilushika Udayangani,Kishor Nandakishor,Marimuthu Palaniswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemKD is a novel Knowledge Distillation framework designed for time series models, addressing temporal dependencies and memory retention issues. It outperforms existing methods, reducing model size by ~500x while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods for deep learning models overlook the unique challenges of time series data, such as temporal dependencies and memory retention, limiting their effectiveness in resource-constrained environments.

Method: MemKD introduces a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between teacher and student models across subsequences in time series data, ensuring effective knowledge transfer.

Result: MemKD reduces parameter size and memory usage by ~500 times while maintaining performance comparable to the teacher model, outperforming state-of-the-art KD methods.

Conclusion: MemKD enables the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks for real-time time series analysis, overcoming the limitations of traditional KD methods.

Abstract: Deep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks and their variants, such as long short-term memory, have significantly advanced time series data analysis. These models capture complex, sequential patterns in time series, enabling real-time assessments. However, their high computational complexity and large model sizes pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and edge computing platforms. Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour. This approach facilitates the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks suitable for real-time, time series analysis tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MemKD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods. It reduces parameter size and memory usage by approximately 500 times while maintaining comparable performance to the teacher model.

*Pritthijit Nath,Sebastian Schemm,Henry Moss,Peter Haynes,Emily Shuckburgh,Mark J. Webb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework using reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically learn parametrisation schemes in weather and climate models shows improved performance over static methods across various testbeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional parametrisation schemes in weather and climate models rely on fixed coefficients, leading to persistent biases. RL offers a way to adaptively update these schemes based on evolving model states.

Method: The study evaluates nine RL algorithms across three testbeds: Simple Climate Bias Correction (SCBC), Radiative-Convective Equilibrium (RCE), and Zonal Mean Energy Balance Model (EBM), comparing single-agent and federated multi-agent settings.

Result: Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) performed best, with federated RL enabling specialised control and faster convergence. RL-driven updates reduced biases and improved accuracy.

Conclusion: RL provides scalable, state-dependent parametrisations that outperform static methods, offering potential for online learning in numerical models.

Abstract: Weather and climate models rely on parametrisations to represent unresolved sub-grid processes. Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes. The learnt corrections were also physically meaningful as agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments to limit drift. Overall, results highlight RL to deliver skilful state-dependent, and regime-aware parametrisations, offering a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models.

*Anherutowa Calvo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights predictable gradient manifolds in deep learning optimization, introducing measurable metrics to quantify predictability and low-rank structure of gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize empirical observations of predictable and low-dimensional gradient structures in deep learning training trajectories.

Method: Introduces prediction-based path length and predictable rank to measure gradient predictability and intrinsic temporal dimension, respectively.

Result: Shows gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit low-rank structure across architectures and tasks, stable across setups.

Conclusion: Provides a unifying framework for optimization dynamics, suggesting adaptive optimizers and prediction-based designs grounded in measurable gradient properties.

Abstract: Deep learning optimization exhibits structure that is not captured by worst-case gradient bounds. Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds.
  We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation.
  Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections.
  Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime. This perspective suggests new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design grounded in measurable properties of real training runs.

*Beier Luo,Cheng Wang,Hongxin Wei,Sharon Li,Xuefeng Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-training LLMs often become overconfident. Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework, addresses this by aligning both final confidence and intermediate inference processes, reducing calibration errors without losing performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training improves LLMs but harms confidence calibration, causing systematic overconfidence. Existing methods focus on static output-distribution matching, ignoring inference-time dynamics.

Method: Proposes Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework. It aligns final confidence (confidence drift) and intermediate inference pathways (process drift) using a single temperature parameter.

Result: Dual-Align consistently outperforms baselines, reducing calibration errors and approaching a supervised oracle's performance while preserving post-training gains.

Conclusion: Dual-Align effectively addresses calibration errors from confidence and process drift, offering a robust solution without sacrificing post-training improvements.

Abstract: Post-training improves large language models (LLMs) but often worsens confidence calibration, leading to systematic overconfidence. Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains. Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines, reducing calibration errors and approaching a supervised oracle.

Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and privacy issues in air transport by creating synthetic delay time series.

Method: Comparison of two Deep Learning models and a simplified Genetic Algorithm for synthetic data generation.

Result: The Genetic Algorithm produces highly realistic and variable delay time series, validated for detecting delay propagations.

Conclusion: Synthetic delay time series are effective and shared publicly for scientific use.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is receiving increasing attention from the scientific community, thanks to its ability to solve problems like data scarcity and privacy, and is starting to find applications in air transport. We here tackle the problem of generating synthetic, yet realistic, time series of delays at airports, starting from large collections of operations in Europe and the US. We specifically compare three models, two of them based on state of the art Deep Learning algorithms, and one simplified Genetic Algorithm approach. We show how the latter can generate time series that are almost indistinguishable from real ones, while maintaining a high variability. We further validate the resulting time series in a problem of detecting delay propagations between airports. We finally make the synthetic data available to the scientific community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LEGATO, a method for continuous and controllable identity forgetting in generative models using Neural ODEs, addressing inefficiency, limited controllability, and catastrophic collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods are inefficient, lack controllability, and cause catastrophic collapse. LEGATO aims to solve these issues.

Method: LEGATO uses Neural ODE adapters for smooth forgetting, keeps original weights frozen, and employs trajectory consistency constraints.

Result: LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids collapse, and reduces fine-tuned parameters.

Conclusion: LEGATO provides an effective, interpretable, and stable solution for identity forgetting in generative models.

Abstract: Machine unlearning has become a crucial role in enabling generative models trained on large datasets to remove sensitive, private, or copyright-protected data. However, existing machine unlearning methods face three challenges in learning to forget identity of generative models: 1) inefficient, where identity erasure requires fine-tuning all the model's parameters; 2) limited controllability, where forgetting intensity cannot be controlled and explainability is lacking; 3) catastrophic collapse, where the model's retention capability undergoes drastic degradation as forgetting progresses. Forgetting has typically been handled through discrete and unstable updates, often requiring full-model fine-tuning and leading to catastrophic collapse. In this work, we argue that identity forgetting should be modeled as a continuous trajectory, and introduce LEGATO - Learn to ForgEt Identity in GenerAtive Models via Trajectory-consistent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. LEGATO augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters, enabling smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. This formulation allows forgetting intensity to be precisely modulated via ODE step size, offering interpretability and robustness. To further ensure stability, we introduce trajectory consistency constraints that explicitly prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning. Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse and reduces fine-tuned parameters.

*Nikolay Yudin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates robustness issues in character-level Transformers trained for modular addition, identifying failure modes like position shifts and OOD templates, and introduces a training method to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on in-distribution accuracy but ignored robustness to input variations like position shifts or OOD templates. The study aims to address these gaps.

Method: The authors propose a training recipe with boundary markers, position curriculum, diverse templates, and consistency training across variants.

Result: The method improves robustness to position shifts and OOD templates while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, outperforming baseline and ablation models.

Conclusion: Explicitly training invariances absent from the data distribution enhances procedural generalization under noisy supervision.

Abstract: Building on insights from the grokking literature, we study character-level Transformers trained to compute modular addition from text, and focus on robustness under input-format variation rather than only in-distribution accuracy. We identify a previously under-emphasized failure mode: models that achieve high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when the same expression is shifted to different absolute character positions ("position shift") or presented under out-of-distribution natural-language templates. Using a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97, we show that a baseline model reaches strong in-distribution performance yet collapses under position shift and template OOD. We then introduce a simple training recipe that combines (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum that broadens the range of absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. Across three seeds, this intervention substantially improves robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under our setup. Our results suggest that steering procedural generalization under noisy supervision benefits from explicitly training invariances that are otherwise absent from the data distribution, and we provide a reproducible evaluation protocol and artifacts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using classifier ensembles and sliding-window postprocessing improves asynchronous EEG-based detection of movement intentions, especially in online settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke rehabilitation can benefit from robot-assisted therapy, which requires accurate detection of movement intentions from EEG signals.

Method: Analyzed two EEG datasets from 14 healthy subjects performing self-initiated arm movements, comparing SVM, MLP, and EEGNet models in offline and pseudo-online evaluations.

Result: Classifier ensembles outperformed single models in pseudo-online evaluations with optimal postprocessing windows, reducing false positives. Offline results showed no significant improvement.

Conclusion: Classifier ensembles and postprocessing enhance movement intention detection, proving especially effective for online applications.

Abstract: Objective: Stroke is one of the leading causes of disabilities. One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ArtCognition, a multimodal framework combining visual and behavioral kinematic cues from digital drawings (HTP test) for affective state assessment, validated by correlations with psychological metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing human affective states non-verbally is challenging, and digital drawing offers an underexplored modality for this purpose.

Method: ArtCognition fuses static visual features (computer vision) and dynamic kinematic cues (stroke speed, pauses) using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.

Result: Combined visual and kinematic cues provide nuanced assessments, with significant correlations to standard psychological metrics.

Conclusion: ArtCognition offers a scalable, non-intrusive tool for affective state assessment, aiding clinicians in mental healthcare.

Abstract: The objective assessment of human affective and psychological states presents a significant challenge, particularly through non-verbal channels. This paper introduces digital drawing as a rich and underexplored modality for affective sensing. We present a novel multimodal framework, named ArtCognition, for the automated analysis of the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a widely used psychological instrument. ArtCognition uniquely fuses two distinct data streams: static visual features from the final artwork, captured by computer vision models, and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues derived from the drawing process itself, such as stroke speed, pauses, and smoothness. To bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level psychological interpretation, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This grounds the analysis in established psychological knowledge, enhancing explainability and reducing the potential for model hallucination. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone. We show significant correlations between the extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics, validating the framework's potential as a scalable tool to support clinicians. This work contributes a new methodology for non-intrusive affective state assessment and opens new avenues for technology-assisted mental healthcare.

TL;DR: An explainable deep learning framework integrates CGM and lab data to identify five latent metabolic phenotypes in T1D, highlighting key biomarkers and their associations with health risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the metabolic heterogeneity of T1D inadequately captured by traditional biomarkers like HbA1c.

Method: A transformer encoder models temporal dependencies in multimodal data (CGM and lab profiles), and Gaussian mixture modeling identifies metabolic phenotypes. Interpretability is achieved via attention visualization and SHAP analysis.

Result: Five metabolic phenotypes were identified, showing distinct biochemical profiles and modest associations with conditions like hypertension and heart failure. Glucose variability and specific biomarkers (e.g., HbA1c, triglycerides) were key contributors.

Conclusion: The framework successfully reveals coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D, enabling better risk stratification beyond single biomarkers.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a highly metabolically heterogeneous disease that cannot be adequately characterized by conventional biomarkers such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles to learn multimodal temporal embeddings of individual metabolic status. Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Overall, this explainable multimodal temporal embedding framework reveals physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how test set contamination impacts generative evaluations in AI systems, revealing performance improvements with contamination and model size, and explores mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate evaluation of AI systems is compromised by test set contamination, especially in generative tasks, yet its effects are less understood compared to discriminative tasks.

Method: Pretraining language models on contaminated MATH benchmark data, analyzing performance via scaling laws, and studying further training and inference factors like temperature and solution length.

Result: Contamination improves model performance; even minor contamination leads to lower loss. Mitigation strategies like fresh data or higher sampling temperatures reduce contamination effects.

Conclusion: Generative evaluations introduce new complexities in AI assessment due to memorization and contamination interactions, necessitating trustworthy evaluation methods.

Abstract: As frontier AI systems are pretrained on web-scale data, test set contamination has become a critical concern for accurately assessing their capabilities. While research has thoroughly investigated the impact of test set contamination on discriminative evaluations like multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has studied the impact of test set contamination on generative evaluations. In this work, we quantitatively assess the effect of test set contamination on generative evaluations through the language model lifecycle. We pretrain language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, sweeping model sizes and number of test set replicas contaminating the pretraining corpus; performance improves with contamination and model size. Using scaling laws, we make a surprising discovery: including even a single test set replica enables models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error of training on the uncontaminated corpus. We then study further training: overtraining with fresh data reduces the effects of contamination, whereas supervised finetuning on the training set can either increase or decrease performance on test data, depending on the amount of pretraining contamination. Finally, at inference, we identify factors that modulate memorization: high sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones, presenting a contrast with discriminative evaluations, where solutions are only a few tokens in length. By characterizing how generation and memorization interact, we highlight a new layer of complexity for trustworthy evaluation of AI systems.

*Mohammad Ali Javidian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods for imputing missing target variables in causal domain adaptation, using compact, stable representations and offering solutions for both linear Gaussian and nonlinear/non-Gaussian cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of imputing target variables in target domains where they are entirely missing, especially under various shifts, by learning stable representations.

Method: For linear Gaussian models, a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck (GIB) solution is derived, resembling CCA-style projections. For nonlinear/non-Gaussian cases, a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) encoder-predictor is introduced.

Result: The methods achieve accurate imputations across synthetic and real datasets, supporting high-dimensional causal models.

Conclusion: The approach provides a unified, lightweight toolkit for causal domain adaptation, effective in diverse settings.

Abstract: We tackle a common domain adaptation setting in causal systems. In this setting, the target variable is observed in the source domain but is entirely missing in the target domain. We aim to impute the target variable in the target domain from the remaining observed variables under various shifts. We frame this as learning a compact, mechanism-stable representation. This representation preserves information relevant for predicting the target while discarding spurious variation. For linear Gaussian causal models, we derive a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck (GIB) solution. This solution reduces to a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-style projection and offers Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-aware options when desired. For nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, we introduce a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) encoder-predictor. This approach scales to high dimensions and can be trained on source data and deployed zero-shot to the target domain. Across synthetic and real datasets, our approach consistently attains accurate imputations, supporting practical use in high-dimensional causal models and furnishing a unified, lightweight toolkit for causal domain adaptation.

### [286] [Phasor Agents: Oscillatory Graphs with Three-Factor Plasticity and Sleep-Staged Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04362)
*Rodja Trappe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Phasor Agents use Phasor Graphs (coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators) for representation and learning via local plasticity. Stability is ensured by separating wake tagging and offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging and sleep dynamics. Experiments validate mechanisms and show improved learning and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of stability in oscillatory substrates and ensure representational diversity, the paper introduces wake/sleep separation and REM-like replay, inspired by biological processes.

Method: Uses Phasor Graphs of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators for representation, with learning via three-factor local plasticity. Wake tagging is separated from offline consolidation, mimicking synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics.

Result: Experiments show improved learning stability (67% under matched budgets), better planning (+45.5% maze success), and emergent latent-learning signatures. Phase-coherent retrieval and other mechanisms outperform baselines.

Conclusion: The Phasor Agents framework successfully combines oscillatory dynamics with biologically inspired learning mechanisms, demonstrating robustness and efficiency in representation and planning tasks. The approach is open-source.

Abstract: Phasor Agents are dynamical systems whose internal state is a Phasor Graph: a weighted graph of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. A Stuart-Landau oscillator is a minimal stable "rhythm generator" (the normal form near a Hopf bifurcation); each oscillator is treated as an abstract computational unit (inspired by, but not claiming to model, biological oscillatory populations). In this interpretation, oscillator phase tracks relative timing (coherence), while amplitude tracks local gain or activity. Relative phase structure serves as a representational medium; coupling weights are learned via three-factor local plasticity - eligibility traces gated by sparse global modulators and oscillation-timed write windows - without backpropagation.
  A central challenge in oscillatory substrates is stability: online weight updates can drive the network into unwanted regimes (e.g., global synchrony), collapsing representational diversity. We therefore separate wake tagging from offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics: deep-sleep-like gated capture commits tagged changes safely, while REM-like replay reconstructs and perturbs experience for planning.
  A staged experiment suite validates each mechanism with ablations and falsifiers: eligibility traces preserve credit under delayed modulation; compression-progress signals pass timestamp-shuffle controls; phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x diffusive baselines under noise; wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67 percent under matched weight-norm budgets; REM replay improves maze success rate by +45.5 percentage points; and a Tolman-style latent-learning signature - immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration, consistent with an internal model - emerges from replay (Tolman, 1948).
  The codebase and all artifacts are open-source.

*Anton Roupassov-Ruiz,Yiyang Zuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PERL policies outperform NERL policies in evolutionary reinforcement learning, with PERL agents surviving 201.69 steps longer on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if programmatic policies (PERL) can match or exceed the performance of neural network policies (NERL) in evolutionary reinforcement learning tasks.

Method: Implemented PERL as soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL) and conducted survival analysis across 4000 trials using Kaplan-Meier curves and RMST metrics.

Result: PERL agents survived 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents, and SDDL agents using learning alone survived 73.67 steps longer than neural agents.

Conclusion: Programmatic policies (PERL) surpass neural policies (NERL) in survival performance in ALife tasks.

Abstract: In evolutionary reinforcement learning tasks (ERL), agent policies are often encoded as small artificial neural networks (NERL). Such representations lack explicit modular structure, limiting behavioral interpretation. We investigate whether programmatic policies (PERL), implemented as soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL), can match the performance of NERL. To support reproducible evaluation, we provide the first fully specified and open-source reimplementation of the classic 1992 Artificial Life (ALife) ERL testbed. We conduct a rigorous survival analysis across 4000 independent trials utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) metrics absent in the original study. We find a statistically significant difference in survival probability between PERL and NERL. PERL agents survive on average 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents. Moreover, SDDL agents using learning alone (no evolution) survive on average 73.67 steps longer than neural agents using both learning and evaluation. These results demonstrate that programmatic policies can exceed the survival performance of neural policies in ALife.

*Corentin Lobet,Francesca Chiaromonte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques current feature attribution methods for lacking direct alignment with model predictions and introduces PiNets, linearly readable pseudo-linear networks, to ensure explanatory alignment and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inadequacy of existing feature attribution methods in reflecting the actual prediction-making process of neural networks, leading to unreliable explanations.

Method: PiNets are proposed as pseudo-linear networks that generate instance-wise linear predictions in any feature space, ensuring explanatory alignment and faithfulness.

Result: PiNets are demonstrated effective in image classification and segmentation tasks, providing explanations that meet multiple criteria of faithfulness and alignment.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that PiNets offer a promising framework for achieving trustworthy explanations by ensuring direct alignment with model predictions.

Abstract: Feature attribution is the dominant paradigm for explaining deep neural networks. However, most existing methods only loosely reflect the model's prediction-making process, thereby merely white-painting the black box. We argue that explanatory alignment is a key aspect of trustworthiness in prediction tasks: explanations must be directly linked to predictions, rather than serving as post-hoc rationalizations. We present model readability as a design principle enabling alignment, and PiNets as a modeling framework to pursue it in a deep learning context. PiNets are pseudo-linear networks that produce instance-wise linear predictions in an arbitrary feature space, making them linearly readable. We illustrate their use on image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrating how PiNets produce explanations that are faithful across multiple criteria in addition to alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for interpretable and efficient reinforcement learning methods in continuous control, especially for safety-critical applications.

Method: Combines Fuzzified Eligibility Traces (FET) and Segmented Experience Replay (SER) with fuzzy Q-learning and a Fuzzified Bellman Equation (FBE). Uses an interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of neural networks.

Result: Achieves superior sample efficiency, reduced variance, and lower computational complexity compared to baselines. Theoretical convergence is proven.

Conclusion: Enhanced-FQL($λ$) is a promising framework for safety-critical applications due to its interpretability, efficiency, and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: This paper introduces a fuzzy reinforcement learning framework, Enhanced-FQL($λ$), that integrates novel Fuzzified Eligibility Traces (FET) and Segmented Experience Replay (SER) into fuzzy Q-learning with Fuzzified Bellman Equation (FBE) for continuous control tasks. The proposed approach employs an interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of complex neural architectures, while maintaining competitive performance through two key innovations: a fuzzified Bellman equation with eligibility traces for stable multi-step credit assignment, and a memory-efficient segment-based experience replay mechanism for enhanced sample efficiency. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed method convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive evaluations in continuous control domains demonstrate that Enhanced-FQL($λ$) achieves superior sample efficiency and reduced variance compared to n-step fuzzy TD and fuzzy SARSA($λ$) baselines, while maintaining substantially lower computational complexity than deep RL alternatives such as DDPG. The framework's inherent interpretability, combined with its computational efficiency and theoretical convergence guarantees, makes it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications where transparency and resource constraints are essential.

### [291] [Rate or Fate? RLV$^\varepsilon$R: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Noisy Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04411)
*Ali Rad,Khashayar Filom,Darioush Keivan,Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani,Ehsan Kamalinejad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) is analyzed for its sensitivity to noisy verification, revealing a phase transition based on Youden's index (J). The study shows that J>0 ensures learning, while J<0 leads to failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand whether noisy verification in RLVR merely slows learning or fundamentally alters outcomes, especially in challenging domains like coding where verification is imperfect.

Method: An analytically tractable multi-armed bandit model of RLVR dynamics is developed, using GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. The dynamics are analyzed by modeling verification errors and grouping completions into reasoning modes.

Result: The study identifies a phase transition governed by Youden's index (J=TPR-FPR): J>0 ensures learning, J=0 is neutral, and J<0 leads to anti-learning and collapse. Experiments confirm the predicted J=0 boundary.

Conclusion: Noise in RLVR primarily affects convergence time (rate) when J>0, but the outcome (fate) hinges on J. The framework provides insights into RLVR stability, convergence, and potential interventions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a simple but powerful paradigm for training LLMs: sample a completion, verify it, and update. In practice, however, the verifier is almost never clean--unit tests probe only limited corner cases; human and synthetic labels are imperfect; and LLM judges (e.g., RLAIF) are noisy and can be exploited--and this problem worsens on harder domains (especially coding) where tests are sparse and increasingly model-generated. We ask a pragmatic question: does the verification noise merely slow down the learning (rate), or can it flip the outcome (fate)?
  To address this, we develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit view of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex. The dynamics decouples into within-correct-mode competition and a one-dimensional evolution for the mass on incorrect modes, whose drift is determined solely by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. This yields a sharp phase transition: when J>0, the incorrect mass is driven toward extinction (learning); when J=0, the process is neutral; and when J<0, incorrect modes amplify until they dominate (anti-learning and collapse). In the learning regime J>0, noise primarily rescales convergence time ("rate, not fate"). Experiments on verifiable programming tasks under synthetic noise reproduce the predicted J=0 boundary. Beyond noise, the framework offers a general lens for analyzing RLVR stability, convergence, and algorithmic interventions.

*Nausherwan Malik,Zubair Khalid,Muhammad Faryad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distribution-guided framework for quantum machine unlearning is proposed, focusing on controlled optimization to balance forgetting and retaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing quantum machine unlearning methods that rely on fixed target distributions and lack explicit control over trade-offs.

Method: Introduces a tunable target distribution from model similarity statistics and uses anchor-based preservation constraints for controlled optimization.

Result: Demonstrates effective suppression of forgotten-class confidence and minimal retained-class performance degradation on Iris and Covertype datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of target design and constraint-based approaches for reliable quantum machine unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data from a learned model without full retraining. While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning. These findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.

TL;DR: This paper reviews performative prediction in machine learning, detailing its risks, mechanisms, and solutions, and introduces a practical framework ('Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix') for assessing and mitigating performativity effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of a socio-technical synthesis in performative prediction literature, providing clarity and practical guidance for practitioners navigating the dynamic effects of ML models in high-stakes environments.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive literature review, categorizing mechanisms and risks of performativity, and propose a typology alongside an assessment framework ('Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix').

Result: The study systematizes performative prediction concepts, identifies key risks and mitigation strategies, and offers a practical tool for evaluating performativity's influence on ML models.

Conclusion: The paper fills a critical gap by synthesizing performative prediction research and equipping practitioners with actionable insights and tools to manage performativity's challenges.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in high-stakes domains where their predictions can actively shape the environments in which they operate, a phenomenon known as performative prediction. This dynamic, in which the deployment of the model influences the very outcome it seeks to predict, can lead to unintended consequences, including feedback loops, performance issues, and significant societal risks. While the literature in the field has grown rapidly in recent years, a socio-technical synthesis that systemises the phenomenon concepts and provides practical guidance has been lacking. This Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of the literature on performative predictions. We provide an overview of the primary mechanisms through which performativity manifests, present a typology of associated risks, and survey the proposed solutions offered in the literature. Our primary contribution is the ``Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix" assessment framework. This practical tool is designed to help practitioners assess the potential influence and severity of performativity on their deployed predictive models and select the appropriate level of algorithmic or human intervention.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a predictive model for prolonged hospital stays (pLoS) using patient and hospital data, achieving strong performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prolonged hospital stays are linked to adverse events, necessitating tools to predict and manage them.

Method: The study uses logistic regression with feature selection based on non-correlated high-information features and graph theory cliques. Data from 120,354 admissions were split into training, test, and validation sets.

Result: The model achieved specificity (0.83), sensitivity (0.64), accuracy (0.76), precision (0.67), and AUC-ROC (0.82), identifying nine key variables.

Conclusion: The model is effective for predicting pLoS and can aid hospital management and intervention studies.

Abstract: Prolonged length of stay (pLoS) is a significant factor associated with the risk of adverse in-hospital events. We develop and explain a predictive model for pLos using admission-level patient and hospital administrative data. The approach includes a feature selection method by selecting non-correlated features with the highest information value. The method uses features weights of evidence to select a representative within cliques from graph theory. The prognosis study analyzed the records from 120,354 hospital admissions at the Hospital Alma Mater de Antioquia between January 2017 and March 2022. After a cleaning process the dataset was split into training (67%), test (22%), and validation (11%) cohorts. A logistic regression model was trained to predict the pLoS in two classes: less than or greater than 7 days. The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC metrics. The feature selection method returns nine interpretable variables, enhancing the models' transparency. In the validation cohort, the pLoS model achieved a specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82-0.84), sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.65), accuracy of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.76-0.77), precision of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.69), and AUC-ROC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81-0.83). The model exhibits strong predictive performance and offers insights into the factors that influence prolonged hospital stays. This makes it a valuable tool for hospital management and for developing future intervention studies aimed at reducing pLoS.

TL;DR: This paper explores embedding-based models to detect socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) behaviors in collaborative computational modeling environments, using multimodal data and LLM-generated summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While learning analytics has advanced in detecting individualized learning processes, there's a gap in addressing collaborative, open-ended problem-solving, which presents unique opportunities and challenges.

Method: The study employs large language models (LLMs) to generate task-aware summaries of student dialogue, combined with text-only embeddings, context-enriched embeddings, and log-derived features to train predictive models for SSRL detection.

Result: Text-only embeddings excel in detecting SSRL behaviors like enactment or group dynamics, while contextual and multimodal features improve detection of constructs like planning and reflection.

Conclusion: Embedding-based models show promise for scalable SSRL detection, enabling real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding in collaborative learning environments.

Abstract: The field of learning analytics has made notable strides in automating the detection of complex learning processes in multimodal data. However, most advancements have focused on individualized problem-solving instead of collaborative, open-ended problem-solving, which may offer both affordances (richer data) and challenges (low cohesion) to behavioral prediction. Here, we extend predictive models to automatically detect socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) behaviors in collaborative computational modeling environments using embedding-based approaches. We leverage large language models (LLMs) as summarization tools to generate task-aware representations of student dialogue aligned with system logs. These summaries, combined with text-only embeddings, context-enriched embeddings, and log-derived features, were used to train predictive models. Results show that text-only embeddings often achieve stronger performance in detecting SSRL behaviors related to enactment or group dynamics (e.g., off-task behavior or requesting assistance). In contrast, contextual and multimodal features provide complementary benefits for constructs such as planning and reflection. Overall, our findings highlight the promise of embedding-based models for extending learning analytics by enabling scalable detection of SSRL behaviors, ultimately supporting real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding in collaborative learning environments that teachers value.

TL;DR: MPM is a meta-learning algorithm that learns generative model structures directly from multiple datasets, improving adaptability and latent representation recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic graphical models struggle with model specification; MPM aims to automate this process by leveraging meta-learning across datasets.

Method: MPM uses a hierarchical architecture with shared global model specifications and dataset-specific local parameters. It employs a VAE-inspired surrogate objective and bi-level optimization for training.

Result: MPM successfully adapts generative models to data and recovers meaningful latent representations in tasks like image and text modeling.

Conclusion: MPM provides an effective way to automate and improve model specification in probabilistic graphical models through meta-learning.

Abstract: While probabilistic graphical models can discover latent structure in data, their effectiveness hinges on choosing well-specified models. Identifying such models is challenging in practice, often requiring iterative checking and revision through trial and error. To this end, we propose meta-probabilistic modeling (MPM), a meta-learning algorithm that learns generative model structure directly from multiple related datasets. MPM uses a hierarchical architecture where global model specifications are shared across datasets while local parameters remain dataset-specific. For learning and inference, we propose a tractable VAE-inspired surrogate objective, and optimize it through bi-level optimization: local variables are updated analytically via coordinate ascent, while global parameters are trained with gradient-based methods. We evaluate MPM on object-centric image modeling and sequential text modeling, demonstrating that it adapts generative models to data while recovering meaningful latent representations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models like Claude 3.5 Haiku process visual properties of text, specifically linebreaking, despite only receiving token sequences.

Method: Mechanistic investigation involving character count representation on curved manifolds, attention-driven geometric transformations, and causal interventions.

Result: Character counts are represented discretely on low-dimensional manifolds, with attention heads twisting them to estimate line boundaries. Visual illusions exploit this mechanism.

Conclusion: Early layers exhibit rich sensory processing, highlighting the complexity of attention algorithms and the value of combining feature-based and geometric interpretability approaches.

Abstract: Language models can perceive visual properties of text despite receiving only sequences of tokens-we mechanistically investigate how Claude 3.5 Haiku accomplishes one such task: linebreaking in fixed-width text. We find that character counts are represented on low-dimensional curved manifolds discretized by sparse feature families, analogous to biological place cells. Accurate predictions emerge from a sequence of geometric transformations: token lengths are accumulated into character count manifolds, attention heads twist these manifolds to estimate distance to the line boundary, and the decision to break the line is enabled by arranging estimates orthogonally to create a linear decision boundary. We validate our findings through causal interventions and discover visual illusions--character sequences that hijack the counting mechanism. Our work demonstrates the rich sensory processing of early layers, the intricacy of attention algorithms, and the importance of combining feature-based and geometric views of interpretability.

TL;DR: A hybrid federated learning (HFL) framework combines FL and FD to balance noise robustness and speed, using adaptive UE clustering and weight selection for improved performance at low SNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the weaknesses of federated learning (FL) and federated distillation (FD) in terms of noise robustness and learning speed.

Method: Proposes HFL, where UEs transmit gradients or logits, and BS selects weights per round. Uses Jenks optimization for UE clustering and damped Newton method for adaptive weight selection.

Result: HFL achieves superior test accuracy at low SNR when exploiting both degrees of freedom (DoF).

Conclusion: HFL effectively balances trade-offs between FL and FD, enhancing performance in distributed learning scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) and federated distillation (FD) are distributed learning paradigms that train UE models with enhanced privacy, each offering different trade-offs between noise robustness and learning speed. To mitigate their respective weaknesses, we propose a hybrid federated learning (HFL) framework in which each user equipment (UE) transmits either gradients or logits, and the base station (BS) selects the per-round weights of FL and FD updates. We derive convergence of HFL framework and introduce two methods to exploit degrees of freedom (DoF) in HFL, which are (i) adaptive UE clustering via Jenks optimization and (ii) adaptive weight selection via a damped Newton method. Numerical results show that HFL achieves superior test accuracy at low SNR when both DoF are exploited.

TL;DR: IGENBENCH is the first benchmark to evaluate the reliability of text-to-infographic generation, revealing significant gaps in current T2I models despite their aesthetic appeal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I models generate visually appealing infographics but may contain subtle errors, prompting the need for a standardized reliability evaluation.

Method: IGENBENCH includes 600 test cases across 30 infographic types, using an automated framework with MLLMs to verify reliability via 10 question types.

Result: Top models achieve high question-level accuracy (0.90) but struggle with infographic-level accuracy (0.49), with data-related dimensions being major bottlenecks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenges in reliable infographic generation and provides a benchmark for future model development.

Abstract: Infographics are composite visual artifacts that combine data visualizations with textual and illustrative elements to communicate information. While recent text-to-image (T2I) models can generate aesthetically appealing images, their reliability in generating infographics remains unclear. Generated infographics may appear correct at first glance but contain easily overlooked issues, such as distorted data encoding or incorrect textual content. We present IGENBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating the reliability of text-to-infographic generation, comprising 600 curated test cases spanning 30 infographic types. We design an automated evaluation framework that decomposes reliability verification into atomic yes/no questions based on a taxonomy of 10 question types. We employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to verify each question, yielding question-level accuracy (Q-ACC) and infographic-level accuracy (I-ACC). We comprehensively evaluate 10 state-of-the-art T2I models on IGENBENCH. Our systematic analysis reveals key insights for future model development: (i) a three-tier performance hierarchy with the top model achieving Q-ACC of 0.90 but I-ACC of only 0.49; (ii) data-related dimensions emerging as universal bottlenecks (e.g., Data Completeness: 0.21); and (iii) the challenge of achieving end-to-end correctness across all models.

Method: SurfFlow uses multi-modality conditional flow matching (CFM) to learn surface geometries and biochemical properties for peptide co-design.

Result: SurfFlow outperforms full-atom baselines on the PepMerge benchmark, showing improved peptide binding accuracy.

Conclusion: Integrating molecular surfaces enhances peptide discovery, highlighting the value of multi-modality approaches in therapeutic peptide design.

Abstract: Therapeutic peptides show promise in targeting previously undruggable binding sites, with recent advancements in deep generative models enabling full-atom peptide co-design for specific protein receptors. However, the critical role of molecular surfaces in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has been underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an omni-design peptides generation paradigm, called SurfFlow, a novel surface-based generative algorithm that enables comprehensive co-design of sequence, structure, and surface for peptides. SurfFlow employs a multi-modality conditional flow matching (CFM) architecture to learn distributions of surface geometries and biochemical properties, enhancing peptide binding accuracy. Evaluated on the comprehensive PepMerge benchmark, SurfFlow consistently outperforms full-atom baselines across all metrics. These results highlight the advantages of considering molecular surfaces in de novo peptide discovery and demonstrate the potential of integrating multiple protein modalities for more effective therapeutic peptide discovery.

### [301] [Not All Steps are Informative: On the Linearity of LLMs' RLVR Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04537)
*Tianle Wang,Zhongyuan Wu,Shenghao Jin,Hao Xu,Wei Chen,Ning Miao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR in LLMs exhibits strong linearity in weight and log-probability evolution, enabling future state prediction via extrapolation, which reduces computation while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of prolonged exploration in RLVR training of LLMs by leveraging observed linear trends in model evolution.

Method: Observes linearity in RLVR training dynamics and proposes Weight Extrapolation and Logits Extrapolation to predict future model states, avoiding continued training.

Result: Weight Extrapolation matches standard RL training performance with less computation, while Logits Extrapolation outperforms continued RL training across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Linear extrapolation techniques offer a computationally efficient alternative to traditional RLVR training without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central component of large language model (LLM) post-training. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable.

*Mengmeng Zhu,Yuxuan Sun,Yukuan Jia,Wei Chen,Bo Ai,Sheng Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAMP, a scheduling algorithm for collaborative perception that balances timeliness and communication resources to improve perception accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative perception faces challenges like timeliness of shared data and constrained communication resources, which impact performance.

Method: Proposes TAMP, a Lyapunov-based optimization policy using a penalty function mapping Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance.

Result: TAMP achieves up to 27% improvement in Average Precision (AP) over baselines in simulations using real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TAMP effectively addresses dynamic scheduling challenges in collaborative perception, optimizing both accuracy and resource usage.

Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) is a critical technology in applications like autonomous driving and smart cities. It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate traffic flow prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems due to urbanization. Existing models struggle with complex spatio-temporal dependencies.

Method: GEnSHIN integrates three key designs: 1) attention-enhanced GCRU with Transformer modules, 2) asymmetric dual-embedding graph generation, and 3) dynamic memory banks with learnable prototypes and graph updaters.

Result: GEnSHIN outperforms benchmarks on METR-LA in MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, showing stability during peak hours. Ablation studies confirm module effectiveness.

Conclusion: GEnSHIN addresses spatio-temporal dependencies effectively, enhancing traffic flow prediction accuracy and stability, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, intelligent transportation systems have an increasing demand for accurate traffic flow prediction. This paper proposes a novel Graph Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network (GEnSHIN) to handle the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow prediction. The model integrates three innovative designs: 1) An attention-enhanced Graph Convolutional Recurrent Unit (GCRU), which strengthens the modeling capability for long-term temporal dependencies by introducing Transformer modules; 2) An asymmetric dual-embedding graph generation mechanism, which leverages the real road network and data-driven latent asymmetric topology to generate graph structures that better fit the characteristics of actual traffic flow; 3) A dynamic memory bank module, which utilizes learnable traffic pattern prototypes to provide personalized traffic pattern representations for each sensor node, and introduces a lightweight graph updater during the decoding phase to adapt to dynamic changes in road network states. Extensive experiments on the public dataset METR-LA show that GEnSHIN achieves or surpasses the performance of comparative models across multiple metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, the model demonstrates excellent prediction stability during peak morning and evening traffic hours. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each core module and its contribution to the final performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new loss function for semi-supervised contrastive learning that uses entropy-based confidence estimation and adaptive weighting to include previously excluded samples, improving classification accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods exclude samples with low predicted class probabilities, limiting their effectiveness. The study aims to include these samples by estimating their confidence.

Method: Proposes a loss function that estimates sample confidence via entropy of predicted probabilities and uses adaptive weighting for pseudo-label assignment.

Result: The method improves classification accuracy and ensures more stable learning, especially in low-label conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances semi-supervised contrastive learning by incorporating confidence-based weighting, making it more inclusive and effective.

Abstract: Conventional semi-supervised contrastive learning methods assign pseudo-labels only to samples whose highest predicted class probability exceeds a predefined threshold, and then perform supervised contrastive learning using those selected samples. In this study, we propose a novel loss function that estimates the confidence of each sample based on the entropy of its predicted probability distribution and applies confidence-based adaptive weighting. This approach enables pseudo-label assignment even to samples that were previously excluded from training and facilitates contrastive learning that accounts for the confidence of both anchor and positive samples in a more principled manner. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves classification accuracy and achieves more stable learning performance even under low-label conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI lacks multisensory integration, limiting its ability to fully mimic human experiences. The paper aims to bridge this gap by connecting AI to human senses and diverse signals.

Method: The approach involves three themes: advanced sensing for richer data capture, scientific principles for modeling multimodal interactions, and technical challenges for synergy (integration, alignment, reasoning, etc.).

Result: The paper outlines foundational steps toward multisensory AI, supported by projects and demos from the MIT Media Lab.

Conclusion: Multisensory AI has transformative potential for human-AI interaction, requiring interdisciplinary advances in sensing, science, and synergy.

Abstract: Our experience of the world is multisensory, spanning a synthesis of language, sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience.

### [306] [Spatial-Temporal Feedback Diffusion Guidance for Controlled Traffic Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04572)
*Xiaowei Mao,Huihu Ding,Yan Lin,Tingrui Wu,Shengnan Guo,Dazhuo Qiu,Feiling Fang,Jilin Hu,Huaiyu Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FENCE improves spatial-temporal traffic data imputation by dynamically adjusting guidance scales based on posterior likelihoods and clustering nodes for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models use uniform guidance scales, which struggle with high missing data rates, causing suboptimal imputation.

Method: FENCE introduces dynamic feedback to adjust guidance scales and clusters nodes based on attention scores for better spatial-temporal correlations.

Result: FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FENCE's adaptive guidance and clustering approach offers superior performance for spatial-temporal traffic data imputation.

Abstract: Imputing missing values in spatial-temporal traffic data is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.
  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DM-RNN, a Density Matrix-based RNN for modeling musical ambiguity, leveraging quantum mechanics to capture statistical ensembles and coherences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of classical RNNs in handling musical ambiguity by proposing a quantum-inspired approach.

Method: Uses Density Matrix and Quantum Channels (CPTP maps) with Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism to ensure valid dynamics.

Result: Provides a framework for quantifying musical uncertainty (Von Neumann Entropy) and voice entanglement (QMI).

Conclusion: DM-RNN offers a rigorous mathematical solution for modeling complex, ambiguous musical structures.

Abstract: Classical Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) summarize musical context into a deterministic hidden state vector, imposing an information bottleneck that fails to capture the inherent ambiguity in music. We propose the Density Matrix RNN (DM-RNN), a novel theoretical architecture utilizing the Density Matrix. This allows the model to maintain a statistical ensemble of musical interpretations (a mixed state), capturing both classical probabilities and quantum coherences. We rigorously define the temporal dynamics using Quantum Channels (CPTP maps). Crucially, we detail a parameterization strategy based on the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, ensuring the learned dynamics remain physically valid (CPTP) by construction. We introduce an analytical framework using Von Neumann Entropy to quantify musical uncertainty and Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) to measure entanglement between voices. The DM-RNN provides a mathematically rigorous framework for modeling complex, ambiguous musical structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepHalo is a neural framework for modeling context-dependent human decision-making, offering explicit control over interaction order and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models ignore context effects in human choices, while recent models lack interpretability or flexibility. DeepHalo addresses this gap.

Method: DeepHalo uses neural networks to capture feature-based context effects, allowing control over interaction order and providing interpretability.

Result: The model performs well on synthetic and real-world datasets, offering predictive accuracy and transparency into choice drivers.

Conclusion: DeepHalo advances context-dependent choice modeling by balancing flexibility and interpretability.

Abstract: Modeling human decision-making is central to applications such as recommendation, preference learning, and human-AI alignment. While many classic models assume context-independent choice behavior, a large body of behavioral research shows that preferences are often influenced by the composition of the choice set itself -- a phenomenon known as the context effect or Halo effect. These effects can manifest as pairwise (first-order) or even higher-order interactions among the available alternatives. Recent models that attempt to capture such effects either focus on the featureless setting or, in the feature-based setting, rely on restrictive interaction structures or entangle interactions across all orders, which limits interpretability. In this work, we propose DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features while enabling explicit control over interaction order and principled interpretation of context effects. Our model enables systematic identification of interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator of context-dependent choice functions when specialized to a featureless setting. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong predictive performance while providing greater transparency into the drivers of choice.

TL;DR: The paper explores reinforcement learning (RL) post-training dynamics, linking reduced output diversity to limited feature variability, and proposes a classifier-first RL (CF-RL) strategy to improve learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why RL post-training reduces output diversity in language models and how to mitigate this effect.

Method: Uses empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) analysis to study RL dynamics and introduces CF-RL, prioritizing classifier updates before standard RL optimization.

Result: CF-RL increases model confidence and accelerates optimization, differing from supervised learning approaches.

Conclusion: The study formalizes RL post-training dynamics and suggests CF-RL as a practical improvement, encouraging further research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a critical stage in modern language model development, playing a key role in improving alignment and reasoning ability. However, several phenomena remain poorly understood, including the reduction in output diversity. To gain a broader understanding of RL post-training, we analyze the learning dynamics of RL post-training from a perspective that has been studied in supervised learning but remains underexplored in RL. We adopt an empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework and decompose the NTK into two components to characterize how RL updates propagate across training samples. Our analysis reveals that limited variability in feature representations can cause RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, providing an explanation for the commonly observed reduction in output diversity after RL post-training. Furthermore, we show that effective learning in this regime depends on rapidly shaping the classifier, which directly affects the gradient component of the NTK. Motivated by these insights, we propose classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a simple two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis by demonstrating increased model confidence and accelerated optimization under CF-RL. Additional analysis shows that the mechanism underlying CF-RL differs from that of linear-probing-then-fine-tuning in supervised learning. Overall, our study formalizes the learning dynamics of RL post-training and motivates further analysis and improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging, especially with latent confounders. Standard GL-SCMs often face overparameterization issues with finite data.

Method: Introduces CGL-SCMs, a simplified subclass of GL-SCMs with standardized exogenous variables, and presents an EM-based algorithm for parameter estimation and causal effect identification.

Result: CGL-SCMs maintain expressiveness for causal effect identifiability and effectively recover causal distributions in synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: CGL-SCMs provide a practical solution for causal effect estimation in finite observational data settings, validated by theoretical and experimental results.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data remains a fundamental challenge in causal inference, especially in the presence of latent confounders. This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating collaborative filtering embeddings into LLMs for better recommendations by projecting user and item data into the token space, improving performance over text-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based recommendation systems often underutilize collaborative signals, focusing too much on text semantics and neglecting richer user-item interaction data.

Method: The authors use lightweight projector modules to map collaborative filtering embeddings into the LLM token space and finetune the LLM to condition on these embeddings alongside text tokens for recommendations.

Result: Preliminary results indicate that combining structured interaction data with textual tokens enhances recommendation performance compared to text-only LLM baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges traditional recommendation systems with LLMs, leveraging both collaborative signals and generative capabilities for improved recommendations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising recommendation systems, offering novel ways to model user preferences through generative approaches. However, many existing methods often rely solely on text semantics or incorporate collaborative signals in a limited manner, typically using only user or item embeddings. These methods struggle to handle multiple item embeddings representing user history, reverting to textual semantics and neglecting richer collaborative information. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations. Preliminary results show that this design effectively leverages structured user-item interaction data, improves recommendation performance over text-only LLM baselines, and offers a practical path for bridging traditional recommendation systems with modern LLMs.

*Àngel Ruiz-Fas,Carlos Granell,José Francisco Ramos,Joaquín Huerta,Sergio Trilles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning-based approach uses Graph Neural Networks and Pointer Networks to optimize last-mile delivery routing by dividing routes into geographical zones, reducing delivery times compared to classical heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for efficient last-mile delivery, where small routing improvements can significantly reduce costs, speed up service, and lower emissions. Classical heuristics fail under asymmetric travel conditions like one-way streets or congestion.

Method: The method employs an encoder-decoder architecture: a Graph Neural Network encoder captures spatial relationships between stops, and a Pointer Network decoder sequentially selects stops. Routes are divided into geographical zones using a Discrete Global Grid System, with separate model instances trained per zone.

Result: Evaluation on Los Angeles routes from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Challenge shows zone-based training reduces average predicted route length compared to general training, especially as the number of stops per route increases.

Conclusion: The zone-based deep learning approach outperforms general training and classical heuristics in optimizing last-mile delivery routes, offering scalable and efficient solutions for asymmetric travel conditions.

Abstract: Rapid e-commerce growth has pushed last-mile delivery networks to their limits, where small routing gains translate into lower costs, faster service, and fewer emissions. Classical heuristics struggle to adapt when travel times are highly asymmetric (e.g., one-way streets, congestion). A deep learning-based approach to the last-mile routing problem is presented to generate geographical zones composed of stop sequences to minimize last-mile delivery times.
  The presented approach is an encoder-decoder architecture. Each route is represented as a complete directed graph whose nodes are stops and whose edge weights are asymmetric travel times. A Graph Neural Network encoder produces node embeddings that captures the spatial relationships between stops. A Pointer Network decoder then takes the embeddings and the route's start node to sequentially select the next stops, assigning a probability to each unvisited node as the next destination.
  Cells of a Discrete Global Grid System which contain route stops in the training data are obtained and clustered to generate geographical zones of similar size in which the process of training and inference are divided. Subsequently, a different instance of the model is trained per zone only considering the stops of the training routes which are included in that zone.
  This approach is evaluated using the Los Angeles routes from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Challenge. Results from general and zone-based training are compared, showing a reduction in the average predicted route length in the zone-based training compared to the general training. The performance improvement of the zone-based approach becomes more pronounced as the number of stops per route increases.

Conclusion: MQ-GNN is a scalable and efficient solution for multi-GPU GNN training, overcoming existing limitations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning graph-structured data, but their scalability is hindered by inefficient mini-batch generation, data transfer bottlenecks, and costly inter-GPU synchronization. Existing training frameworks fail to overlap these stages, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. This paper proposes MQ-GNN, a multi-queue pipelined framework that maximizes training efficiency by interleaving GNN training stages and optimizing resource utilization. MQ-GNN introduces Ready-to-Update Asynchronous Consistent Model (RaCoM), which enables asynchronous gradient sharing and model updates while ensuring global consistency through adaptive periodic synchronization. Additionally, it employs global neighbor sampling with caching to reduce data transfer overhead and an adaptive queue-sizing strategy to balance computation and memory efficiency. Experiments on four large-scale datasets and ten baseline models demonstrate that MQ-GNN achieves up to \boldmath $\bm{4.6\,\times}$ faster training time and 30% improved GPU utilization while maintaining competitive accuracy. These results establish MQ-GNN as a scalable and efficient solution for multi-GPU GNN training.

TL;DR: The paper explores INT8 quantization for KV cache compression in large language models (LLMs) to reduce memory usage during inference. It evaluates four CUDA kernel variants, achieving significant memory reduction (4×) and speedup (up to 1,694×) with minimal accuracy loss.

Result: Their vectorized kernel achieves a 1,694× speedup over CPU baselines, with reconstruction error below 0.004 and attention score error below 0.1. Memory is reduced by 4× with negligible computational overhead (6--58ms).

Conclusion: INT8 quantization is a practical solution for reducing memory pressure in LLM inference, offering significant benefits with minimal impact on model behavior.

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in large language models presents a significant memory bottleneck during inference, growing linearly with sequence length and often exceeding the memory footprint of model weights themselves. We implement and evaluate GPU-accelerated INT8 quantization for KV cache compression, achieving 4$\times$ memory reduction with minimal accuracy degradation. We develop four CUDA kernel variants -- naive, tiled, coarsened, and vectorized -- and benchmark them across realistic workload sizes up to 1 billion elements. Our vectorized kernel achieves up to 1,694$\times$ speedup over CPU baselines while maintaining reconstruction error below 0.004 and attention score error below 0.1 even for 8K-dimensional heads. These results demonstrate that INT8 quantization provides a practical approach for reducing memory pressure in LLM inference with negligible computational overhead (6--58ms) and minimal impact on downstream model behavior

*Elizabeth Donoway,Hailey Joren,Fabien Roger,Jan Leike*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether fine-tuning uncovers latent capabilities or teaches new ones in language models, using an information-theoretic framework called Excess Description Length (EDL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify the fundamental question of how fine-tuning affects language models—whether it reveals existing capabilities or imparts new ones—which is critical for evaluation and safety.

Method: The researchers develop EDL, a metric based on prequential coding, to quantify predictive structure extracted during fine-tuning. It measures the encoding cost gap between online-trained models and the final model.

Result: EDL is proven non-negative, converges to surplus description length with infinite data, and bounds generalization gain. Toy models illustrate insights about information in learning, such as the impact of rare inputs and format learning.

Conclusion: The framework rigorously distinguishes capability elicitation from teaching, aligning with empirical observations of their distinct scaling behaviors.

Abstract: Understanding whether fine-tuning elicits latent capabilities or teaches new ones is a fundamental question for language model evaluation and safety. We develop a formal information-theoretic framework for quantifying how much predictive structure fine-tuning extracts from the train dataset and writes into a model's parameters. Our central quantity, Excess Description Length (EDL), is defined via prequential coding and measures the gap between the bits required to encode training labels sequentially using an evolving model (trained online) and the residual encoding cost under the final trained model. We establish that EDL is non-negative in expectation, converges to surplus description length in the infinite-data limit, and provides bounds on expected generalization gain. Through a series of toy models, we clarify common confusions about information in learning: why random labels yield EDL near zero, how a single example can eliminate many bits of uncertainty about the underlying rule(s) that describe the data distribution, why structure learned on rare inputs contributes proportionally little to expected generalization, and how format learning creates early transients distinct from capability acquisition. This framework provides rigorous foundations for the empirical observation that capability elicitation and teaching exhibit qualitatively distinct scaling signatures.

*Kota Nakamura,Koki Kawabata,Yasuko Matsubara,Yasushi Sakurai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeCast is a dynamic framework for real-time prediction of machine failures using evolving multi-sensor data streams, offering adaptability, practicality, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting machine failures from dynamic, real-time sensor data streams with evolving patterns.

Method: TimeCast identifies time-evolving stages in data, learns individual models for each, and adapts predictions based on pattern shifts. It also scales linearly and updates models online.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while reducing computational time.

Conclusion: TimeCast effectively handles dynamic data streams and improves real-time failure prediction.

Abstract: Given real-time sensor data streams obtained from machines, how can we continuously predict when a machine failure will occur? This work aims to continuously forecast the timing of future events by analyzing multi-sensor data streams. A key characteristic of real-world data streams is their dynamic nature, where the underlying patterns evolve over time. To address this, we present TimeCast, a dynamic prediction framework designed to adapt to these changes and provide accurate, real-time predictions of future event time. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Dynamic: it identifies the distinct time-evolving patterns (i.e., stages) and learns individual models for each, enabling us to make adaptive predictions based on pattern shifts. (b) Practical: it finds meaningful stages that capture time-varying interdependencies between multiple sensors and improve prediction performance; (c) Scalable: our algorithm scales linearly with the input size and enables online model updates on data streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that TimeCast provides higher prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while finding dynamic changes in data streams with a great reduction in computational time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework evaluates seven intraday PV power forecasting models using satellite-based and physics-based approaches, showing satellite models outperform others, especially SolarSTEPS and SHADECast, with high accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess reliability, sharpness, and performance of PV power forecasting models at a national scale and visualize mesoscale cloud system impacts on PV production.

Method: Validates forecasts against satellite-derived SSI, converts irradiance to PV power via machine learning, and compares with data from 6434 Swiss PV stations.

Result: Satellite-based models outperform IFS-ENS, with SolarSTEPS and SHADECast leading in accuracy and reliability. Forecast skill drops with elevation.

Conclusion: Satellite-based models show robustness for operational use, achieving <10% error in daily PV generation forecasts for 82% of days.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for spatiotemporal photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting and use it to evaluate the reliability, sharpness, and overall performance of seven intraday PV power nowcasting models. The model suite includes satellite-based deep learning and optical-flow approaches and physics-based numerical weather prediction models, covering both deterministic and probabilistic formulations. Forecasts are first validated against satellite-derived surface solar irradiance (SSI). Irradiance fields are then converted into PV power using station-specific machine learning models, enabling comparison with production data from 6434 PV stations across Switzerland. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate spatiotemporal PV forecasting at a national scale. We additionally provide the first visualizations of how mesoscale cloud systems shape national PV production on hourly and sub-hourly timescales. Our results show that satellite-based approaches outperform the Integrated Forecast System (IFS-ENS), particularly at short lead times. Among them, SolarSTEPS and SHADECast deliver the most accurate SSI and PV power predictions, with SHADECast providing the most reliable ensemble spread. The deterministic model IrradianceNet achieves the lowest root mean square error, while probabilistic forecasts of SolarSTEPS and SHADECast provide better-calibrated uncertainty. Forecast skill generally decreases with elevation. At a national scale, satellite-based models forecast the daily total PV generation with relative errors below 10% for 82% of the days in 2019-2020, demonstrating robustness and their potential for operational use.

*Rupsa Rani Mishra,D. Chandrasekhar Rao,Ajaya Kumar Tripathy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System with a novel ML algorithm for automated cow health monitoring and disease detection, addressing challenges of manual observation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual cow health monitoring is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors, leading to delays in disease detection and increased costs. Automation is needed for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: An IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System framework is developed, incorporating a novel ML algorithm to analyze physiological and behavioral data for predicting multiple cow diseases.

Result: The proposed system enhances accuracy in disease detection and reduces operational costs by automating health monitoring, improving overall farm productivity.

Conclusion: Automating cow health monitoring using IoT and ML addresses the inefficiencies of manual methods, offering a reliable and cost-effective solution for large-scale farming.

Abstract: Manual observation and monitoring of individual cows for disease detection present significant challenges in large-scale farming operations, as the process is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to reduced accuracy. The reliance on human observation often leads to delays in identifying symptoms, as the sheer number of animals can hinder timely attention to each cow. Consequently, the accuracy and precision of disease detection are significantly compromised, potentially affecting animal health and overall farm productivity. Furthermore, organizing and managing human resources for the manual observation and monitoring of cow health is a complex and economically demanding task. It necessitates the involvement of skilled personnel, thereby contributing to elevated farm maintenance costs and operational inefficiencies. Therefore, the development of an automated, low-cost, and reliable smart system is essential to address these challenges effectively. Although several studies have been conducted in this domain, very few have simultaneously considered the detection of multiple common diseases with high prediction accuracy. However, advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Cyber-Physical Systems have enabled the automation of cow health monitoring with enhanced accuracy and reduced operational costs. This study proposes an IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System framework designed to monitor the daily activities and health status of cow. A novel ML algorithm is proposed for the diagnosis of common cow diseases using collected physiological and behavioral data. The algorithm is designed to predict multiple diseases by analyzing a comprehensive set of recorded physiological and behavioral features, enabling accurate and efficient health assessment.

*Lang Feng,Fuchao Yang,Feng Chen,Xin Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Zhenglin Wan,Ming Yan,Bo An*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AgentOCR leverages visual tokens and segment optical caching to reduce token and memory usage in LLM-based agentic systems while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agentic systems face inefficiencies due to growing textual histories, which inflate token budgets and memory usage. AgentOCR aims to address this by using visual tokens and adaptive compression.

Method: AgentOCR compresses observation-action histories into compact images, uses segment optical caching to avoid redundant re-rendering, and introduces agentic self-compression to balance task success and token efficiency.

Result: AgentOCR maintains over 95% of text-based agent performance while cutting token consumption by more than 50%. It also achieves a 20x rendering speedup and effective strategic balancing.

Conclusion: AgentOCR offers a scalable solution for deploying LLM-based agents by significantly reducing token and memory overhead without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable agentic systems trained with reinforcement learning (RL) over multi-turn interaction trajectories, but practical deployment is bottlenecked by rapidly growing textual histories that inflate token budgets and memory usage. We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency. Our further analysis validates a 20x rendering speedup from segment optical caching and the effective strategic balancing of self-compression.

*Marios Thoma,Vassilis Vassiliades,Loizos Michael*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evolutionary framework for Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) AI, enabling concurrent learning of non-differentiable symbolic policies and neural weights, overcoming limitations of predefined or differentiable policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeSy frameworks rely on predefined or differentiable symbolic policies, restricting their use when domain expertise is unavailable or policies are non-differentiable. The proposed method aims to address these limitations.

Method: The framework evolves NeSy systems through mutations (symbolic rule additions and neural weight changes) and fitness-based selection. It extends NEUROLOG, adapts Valiant's Evolvability framework, and uses Machine Coaching semantics for trainable symbolic policies.

Result: Experiments show empty-policy NeSy systems can approximate hidden non-differentiable target policies, achieving near-100% median correct performance.

Conclusion: This work advances NeSy AI by enabling learning in domains where expert-derived symbolic knowledge is hard to obtain.

Abstract: Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a promising approach for combining the learning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretable reasoning of symbolic systems. However, existing NeSy frameworks typically require either predefined symbolic policies or policies that are differentiable, limiting their applicability when domain expertise is unavailable or when policies are inherently non-differentiable. We propose a framework that addresses this limitation by enabling the concurrent learning of both non-differentiable symbolic policies and neural network weights through an evolutionary process. Our approach casts NeSy systems as organisms in a population that evolve through mutations (both symbolic rule additions and neural weight changes), with fitness-based selection guiding convergence toward hidden target policies. The framework extends the NEUROLOG architecture to make symbolic policies trainable, adapts Valiant's Evolvability framework to the NeSy context, and employs Machine Coaching semantics for mutable symbolic representations. Neural networks are trained through abductive reasoning from the symbolic component, eliminating differentiability requirements. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that NeSy systems starting with empty policies and random neural weights can successfully approximate hidden non-differentiable target policies, achieving median correct performance approaching 100%. This work represents a step toward enabling NeSy research in domains where the acquisition of symbolic knowledge from experts is challenging or infeasible.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a parallelized method for node-level explainability in GNNs using graph partitioning, improving scalability and efficiency without compromising correctness, with a memory-efficient variant for limited-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and efficient node-level explainability in GNNs, as traditional methods become time-consuming with larger graphs, and batching compromises quality.

Method: The approach decomposes the graph into disjoint subgraphs for parallel computation of explainability, with a dropout-based reconstruction mechanism for memory constraints.

Result: Experiments show significant speedups, enabling scalable and transparent explainability for large-scale GNN models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of node-level explainability in GNNs, with practical solutions for memory limitations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, by exploiting the structural information in graph-structured data. However, in node classification, computing node-level explainability becomes extremely time-consuming as the size of the graph increases, while batching strategies often degrade explanation quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to parallelizing node-level explainability in GNNs through graph partitioning. By decomposing the graph into disjoint subgraphs, we enable parallel computation of explainability for node neighbors, significantly improving the scalability and efficiency without affecting the correctness of the results, provided sufficient memory is available. For scenarios where memory is limited, we further propose a dropout-based reconstruction mechanism that offers a controllable trade-off between memory usage and explanation fidelity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial speedups, enabling scalable and transparent explainability for large-scale GNN models.

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues with handling missing node features in GNNs, introduces dense-feature datasets, and proposes GNNmim, a competitive baseline method for incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN studies overlook realistic scenarios with dense features and non-MCAR missingness, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Introduces dense-feature datasets and evaluation protocols for realistic missingness. Proposes GNNmim, a baseline method for incomplete feature data.

Result: GNNmim performs competitively across diverse datasets and missingness regimes.

Conclusion: The study advances GNN robustness evaluation and provides a simple yet effective solution for missing feature handling.

Abstract: Handling missing node features is a key challenge for deploying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in real-world domains such as healthcare and sensor networks. Existing studies mostly address relatively benign scenarios, namely benchmark datasets with (a) high-dimensional but sparse node features and (b) incomplete data generated under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanisms. For (a), we theoretically prove that high sparsity substantially limits the information loss caused by missingness, making all models appear robust and preventing a meaningful comparison of their performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce one synthetic and three real-world datasets with dense, semantically meaningful features. For (b), we move beyond MCAR and design evaluation protocols with more realistic missingness mechanisms. Moreover, we provide a theoretical background to state explicit assumptions on the missingness process and analyze their implications for different methods. Building on this analysis, we propose GNNmim, a simple yet effective baseline for node classification with incomplete feature data. Experiments show that GNNmim is competitive with respect to specialized architectures across diverse datasets and missingness regimes.

TL;DR: FibreCastML is an open ML framework predicting full fibre diameter spectra in electrospinning, outperforming linear models and highlighting solution concentration as key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML approaches predict only mean fibre diameters, neglecting the full distribution critical for scaffold performance.

Method: FibreCastML uses a meta-dataset of 1778 studies to train seven ML models, validated via nested cross-validation and interpretability tools.

Result: Non-linear models achieved high accuracy (R²>0.91); solution concentration was the dominant parameter.

Conclusion: FibreCastML improves electrospinning reproducibility and optimization by predicting full diameter distributions.

Abstract: Electrospinning is a scalable technique for producing fibrous scaffolds with tunable micro- and nanoscale architectures for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and wound care. While machine learning (ML) has been used to support electrospinning process optimisation, most existing approaches predict only mean fibre diameters, neglecting the full diameter distribution that governs scaffold performance. This work presents FibreCastML, an open, distribution-aware ML framework that predicts complete fibre diameter spectra from routinely reported electrospinning parameters and provides interpretable insights into process structure relationships.
  A meta-dataset comprising 68538 individual fibre diameter measurements extracted from 1778 studies across 16 biomedical polymers was curated. Six standard processing parameters, namely solution concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, tip to collector distance, needle diameter, and collector rotation speed, were used to train seven ML models using nested cross validation with leave one study out external folds. Model interpretability was achieved using variable importance analysis, SHapley Additive exPlanations, correlation matrices, and three dimensional parameter maps.
  Non linear models consistently outperformed linear baselines, achieving coefficients of determination above 0.91 for several widely used polymers. Solution concentration emerged as the dominant global driver of fibre diameter distributions. Experimental validation across different electrospinning systems demonstrated close agreement between predicted and measured distributions. FibreCastML enables more reproducible and data driven optimisation of electrospun scaffold architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learnable multipliers improve weight decay equilibrium in LLM pretraining by optimizing scale adaptively, outperforming muP and reducing tuning overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The equilibrium norm induced by weight decay and stochastic gradient noise is suboptimal, limiting performance. Learnable multipliers address this by adapting scale to data.

Method: Introduce learnable scalar, per-row, and per-column multipliers to matrix layers, freeing weight norms from suboptimal constraints. Validated with Adam and Muon optimizers.

Result: Outperforms muP baseline, reduces tuning overhead, and matches performance gains of switching optimizers in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Learnable multipliers offer a flexible, effective solution to suboptimal weight norms, enhancing performance and practicality in LLM training.

Abstract: Applying weight decay (WD) to matrix layers is standard practice in large-language-model pretraining. Prior work suggests that stochastic gradient noise induces a Brownian-like expansion of the weight matrices W, whose growth is counteracted by WD, leading to a WD-noise equilibrium with a certain weight norm ||W||. In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as a harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach a learnable scalar multiplier to W and confirm that the WD-noise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as a learnable, more expressive generalization of muP multipliers. It outperforms a well-tuned muP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers. Finally, we validate learnable multipliers with both Adam and Muon optimizers, where it shows improvement in downstream evaluations matching the improvement of the switching from Adam to Muon.

*Sifan Yang,Wenhao Yang,Wei Jiang,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves regret bounds for distributed online convex optimization with compressed communication by proposing a novel algorithm, achieving better dependence on compression quality and network size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regret bounds suffer from quadratic or quartic dependence on compression quality and super-linear dependence on network size, prompting the need for improvement.

Method: Proposes a two-level blocking update framework with an online gossip strategy and error compensation scheme.

Result: Achieves improved regret bounds of O~(ω^{-1/2}ρ^{-1}n√T) for convex functions and O~(ω^{-1}ρ^{-2}nlnT) for strongly convex functions.

Conclusion: The algorithm significantly improves existing bounds and establishes optimality with lower bounds, extending to bandit feedback scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate distributed online convex optimization with compressed communication, where $n$ learners connected by a network collaboratively minimize a sequence of global loss functions using only local information and compressed data from neighbors. Prior work has established regret bounds of $O(\max\{ω^{-2}ρ^{-4}n^{1/2},ω^{-4}ρ^{-8}\}n\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\max\{ω^{-2}ρ^{-4}n^{1/2},ω^{-4}ρ^{-8}\}n\ln{T})$ for convex and strongly convex functions, respectively, where $ω\in(0,1]$ is the compression quality factor ($ω=1$ means no compression) and $ρ<1$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. However, these regret bounds suffer from a \emph{quadratic} or even \emph{quartic} dependence on $ω^{-1}$. Moreover, the \emph{super-linear} dependence on $n$ is also undesirable. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that achieves improved regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(ω^{-1/2}ρ^{-1}n\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(ω^{-1}ρ^{-2}n\ln{T})$ for convex and strongly convex functions, respectively. The primary idea is to design a \emph{two-level blocking update framework} incorporating two novel ingredients: an online gossip strategy and an error compensation scheme, which collaborate to \emph{achieve a better consensus} among learners. Furthermore, we establish the first lower bounds for this problem, justifying the optimality of our results with respect to both $ω$ and $T$. Additionally, we consider the bandit feedback scenario, and extend our method with the classic gradient estimators to enhance existing regret bounds.

TL;DR: The paper introduces cardinality augmented loss functions to address class imbalance in neural network training, showing improved performance for minority classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance skews classifier performance towards majority classes, necessitating a solution to enhance minority class performance.

Method: The authors derive cardinality augmented loss functions from mathematical invariants like magnitude and spread, applying them to neural network training.

Result: The method improves performance for minority classes and overall metrics on both artificial and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Cardinality augmented loss functions effectively mitigate class imbalance, enhancing neural network training.

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common and pernicious issue for the training of neural networks. Often, an imbalanced majority class can dominate training to skew classifier performance towards the majority outcome. To address this problem we introduce cardinality augmented loss functions, derived from cardinality-like invariants in modern mathematics literature such as magnitude and the spread. These invariants enrich the concept of cardinality by evaluating the `effective diversity' of a metric space, and as such represent a natural solution to overly homogeneous training data. In this work, we establish a methodology for applying cardinality augmented loss functions in the training of neural networks and report results on both artificially imbalanced datasets as well as a real-world imbalanced material science dataset. We observe significant performance improvement among minority classes, as well as improvement in overall performance metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the belief that diverse mixtures of hard and soft constraints are essential for scaling reinforcement learning in instruction following tasks. Instead, it finds that hard-only constraints outperform mixed datasets, with reward precision being the key driver. A data-centric refinement strategy prioritizing precision improves performance and reduces training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the prevailing consensus that constraint diversity is crucial for generalizing instruction following tasks, questioning its validity.

Method: The authors conduct empirical investigations, analyze reward precision, and propose a data-centric refinement strategy focusing on high-precision rewards.

Result: Models trained on hard-only constraints outperform mixed datasets, achieving a 13.4% performance improvement and 58% reduction in training time.

Conclusion: The findings suggest shifting focus from data diversity to high-precision rewards for better alignment and generalization in instruction following tasks.

Abstract: A central belief in scaling reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for instruction following (IF) tasks is that, a diverse mixture of verifiable hard and unverifiable soft constraints is essential for generalizing to unseen instructions. In this work, we challenge this prevailing consensus through a systematic empirical investigation. Counter-intuitively, we find that models trained on hard-only constraints consistently outperform those trained on mixed datasets. Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data-centric refinement strategy that prioritizes reward precision. Evaluated on five benchmarks, our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 13.4\% in performance while achieving a 58\% reduction in training time, maintaining strong generalization beyond instruction following. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift: moving away from the indiscriminate pursuit of data diversity toward high-precision rewards.

*James Hinns,Sofie Goethals,Stephan Van der Veeken,Theodoros Evgeniou,David Martens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how cherry-picking counterfactual explanations can manipulate perceptions of model behavior and finds that detecting such manipulation is difficult due to the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to expose the potential for cherry-picking in counterfactual explanations, which can misrepresent model behavior, and to assess the feasibility of detecting such manipulation.

Method: The authors formally define cherry-picking in terms of admissible explanation spaces and utility functions, then analyze detection capabilities under three levels of auditor access: full, partial, and explanation-only.

Result: Detection of cherry-picking is limited even with full procedural access, as the flexibility in explanation specification and multiplicity of counterfactuals mask manipulation. Empirical results show cherry-picked explanations are often indistinguishable from baseline ones.

Conclusion: The paper recommends prioritizing reproducibility, standardization, and procedural constraints over post-hoc detection measures for counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are widely used to communicate how inputs must change for a model to alter its prediction. For a single instance, many valid counterfactuals can exist, which leaves open the possibility for an explanation provider to cherry-pick explanations that better suit a narrative of their choice, highlighting favourable behaviour and withholding examples that reveal problematic behaviour. We formally define cherry-picking for counterfactual explanations in terms of an admissible explanation space, specified by the generation procedure, and a utility function. We then study to what extent an external auditor can detect such manipulation. Considering three levels of access to the explanation process: full procedural access, partial procedural access, and explanation-only access, we show that detection is extremely limited in practice. Even with full procedural access, cherry-picked explanations can remain difficult to distinguish from non cherry-picked explanations, because the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals and flexibility in the explanation specification provide sufficient degrees of freedom to mask deliberate selection. Empirically, we demonstrate that this variability often exceeds the effect of cherry-picking on standard counterfactual quality metrics such as proximity, plausibility, and sparsity, making cherry-picked explanations statistically indistinguishable from baseline explanations. We argue that safeguards should therefore prioritise reproducibility, standardisation, and procedural constraints over post-hoc detection, and we provide recommendations for algorithm developers, explanation providers, and auditors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical limitations and recurring properties of GRPO-style methods in reinforcement learning for large language models.

Method: Theoretical analysis of GRPO methods within a unified surrogate formulation to study gradient biases, reward scaling effects, and optimizer momentum.

Result: Identified non-uniform group weighting biases, insensitivity to reward scaling due to AdamW, and momentum-driven policy updates beyond clipping regions.

Conclusion: The findings highlight fundamental limitations of current GRPO methods and offer principled guidance for future improvements.

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning methods, like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are widely used nowadays to post-train large language models. Despite their empirical success, they exhibit structural mismatches between reward optimization and the underlying training objective. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of GRPO style methods by studying them within a unified surrogate formulation. This perspective reveals recurring properties that affect all the methods under analysis: (i) non-uniform group weighting induces systematic gradient biases on shared prefix tokens; (ii) interactions with the AdamW optimizer make training dynamics largely insensitive to reward scaling; and (iii) optimizer momentum can push policy updates beyond the intended clipping region under repeated optimization steps. We believe that these findings highlight fundamental limitations of current approaches and provide principled guidance for the design of future formulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imputation methods treat numerical and categorical attributes independently, ignoring their interdependencies, which limits accuracy.

Method: The proposed approach integrates cross-type feature dependencies into a unified framework, utilizing both complete and incomplete data instances.

Result: Experiments show superior performance over existing techniques and enhanced effectiveness in downstream machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust solution for real-world systems with missing data by improving imputation accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: Missing value imputation is a fundamental challenge in machine intelligence, heavily dependent on data completeness. Current imputation methods often handle numerical and categorical attributes independently, overlooking critical interdependencies among heterogeneous features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel imputation approach that explicitly models cross-type feature dependencies within a unified framework. Our method leverages both complete and incomplete instances to ensure accurate and consistent imputation in tabular data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance over existing techniques and significantly enhances downstream machine learning tasks, providing a robust solution for real-world systems with missing data.

### [333] [Approximate equivariance via projection-based regularisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05028)
*Torben Berndt,Jan Stühmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a projection-based regulariser for approximate equivariance in neural networks, offering efficiency and performance improvements over sample-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The resurgence of non-equivariant models due to their runtime advantages and imperfect symmetries motivates the need for balanced approaches that respect symmetries while fitting data distributions.

Method: The paper proposes a projection-based regulariser that decomposes linear layers into equivariant and non-equivariant components, penalising non-equivariance at an operator level across the full group orbit.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms prior approaches in performance and efficiency, achieving runtime gains over sample-based regularisers.

Conclusion: The projection-based regulariser provides a more efficient and effective solution for achieving approximate equivariance in neural networks.

Abstract: Equivariance is a powerful inductive bias in neural networks, improving generalisation and physical consistency. Recently, however, non-equivariant models have regained attention, due to their better runtime performance and imperfect symmetries that might arise in real-world applications. This has motivated the development of approximately equivariant models that strike a middle ground between respecting symmetries and fitting the data distribution. Existing approaches in this field usually apply sample-based regularisers which depend on data augmentation at training time, incurring a high sample complexity, in particular for continuous groups such as $SO(3)$. This work instead approaches approximate equivariance via a projection-based regulariser which leverages the orthogonal decomposition of linear layers into equivariant and non-equivariant components. In contrast to existing methods, this penalises non-equivariance at an operator level across the full group orbit, rather than point-wise. We present a mathematical framework for computing the non-equivariance penalty exactly and efficiently in both the spatial and spectral domain. In our experiments, our method consistently outperforms prior approximate equivariance approaches in both model performance and efficiency, achieving substantial runtime gains over sample-based regularisers.

*Anees Fatima,Mohammad Abdus Salam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores ML algorithms (XGBoost, ARIMA, Fb Prophet, SVR) for demand forecasting in SCM, showing XGBoost as the most accurate when including external factors like holidays and weekdays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional demand forecasting methods often ignore external factors, leading to inefficiencies. This study aims to improve accuracy by integrating these factors using ML.

Method: Four ML algorithms (XGBoost, ARIMA, Fb Prophet, SVR) were tested for demand forecasting, incorporating external variables like weekdays and holidays.

Result: XGBoost achieved the lowest MAE (22.7), outperforming others. ARIMAX and Fb Prophet also improved, while SVR performed poorly. External factors enhanced model precision.

Conclusion: XGBoost is the most effective algorithm for demand forecasting with external factors. The study provides a framework for better inventory management in retail and vending systems.

Abstract: Demand forecasting in supply chain management (SCM) is critical for optimizing inventory, reducing waste, and improving customer satisfaction. Conventional approaches frequently neglect external influences like weather, festivities, and equipment breakdowns, resulting in inefficiencies. This research investigates the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve demand prediction in retail and vending machine sectors. Four machine learning algorithms. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Facebook Prophet (Fb Prophet), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to forecast inventory requirements. Ex-ternal factors like weekdays, holidays, and sales deviation indicators were methodically incorporated to enhance precision. XGBoost surpassed other models, reaching the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 22.7 with the inclusion of external variables. ARIMAX and Fb Prophet demonstrated noteworthy enhancements, whereas SVR fell short in performance. Incorporating external factors greatly improves the precision of demand forecasting models, and XGBoost is identified as the most efficient algorithm. This study offers a strong framework for enhancing inventory management in retail and vending machine systems.

TL;DR: DeepWeightFlow is a Flow Matching model that generates diverse, high-accuracy neural network weights efficiently without requiring fine-tuning, addressing challenges of high-dimensional weight spaces and symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses challenges in generating complete, diverse neural network weights efficiently, overcoming limitations of prior models that struggle with speed or require fine-tuning.

Method: DeepWeightFlow uses Flow Matching to generate weights directly in weight space, applying Git Re-Basin and TransFusion for canonicalization to handle neural network symmetries and improve efficiency.

Result: The model generates high-accuracy weights without fine-tuning, scales to large networks, and outperforms diffusion-based methods in speed, enabling rapid ensemble generation.

Conclusion: DeepWeightFlow advances efficient and scalable generation of diverse neural networks, with significant implications for transfer learning and model ensembling.

Abstract: Building efficient and effective generative models for neural network weights has been a research focus of significant interest that faces challenges posed by the high-dimensional weight spaces of modern neural networks and their symmetries. Several prior generative models are limited to generating partial neural network weights, particularly for larger models, such as ResNet and ViT. Those that do generate complete weights struggle with generation speed or require finetuning of the generated models. In this work, we present DeepWeightFlow, a Flow Matching model that operates directly in weight space to generate diverse and high-accuracy neural network weights for a variety of architectures, neural network sizes, and data modalities. The neural networks generated by DeepWeightFlow do not require fine-tuning to perform well and can scale to large networks. We apply Git Re-Basin and TransFusion for neural network canonicalization in the context of generative weight models to account for the impact of neural network permutation symmetries and to improve generation efficiency for larger model sizes. The generated networks excel at transfer learning, and ensembles of hundreds of neural networks can be generated in minutes, far exceeding the efficiency of diffusion-based methods. DeepWeightFlow models pave the way for more efficient and scalable generation of diverse sets of neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sub-Goal Verifiable Reward (SGVR) to improve Multimodal Large Language Models' geometric reasoning by shifting from outcome-based to subgoal-level evaluation, showing performance gains across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with complex geometric reasoning due to inadequate supervision that doesn't differentiate between guesses and rigorous deduction.

Method: The authors create GeoGoal, a benchmark with verified numeric subgoals, and propose SGVR, which uses dense rewards based on the Skeleton Rate instead of sparse signals.

Result: SGVR improves geometric reasoning (+9.7%), general math (+8.0%), and other reasoning tasks (+2.8%), showing broad applicability.

Conclusion: Subgoal-level evaluation and SGVR enhance MLLMs' reasoning quality and generalization across diverse domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with complex geometric reasoning, largely because "black box" outcome-based supervision fails to distinguish between lucky guesses and rigorous deduction. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift towards subgoal-level evaluation and learning. We first construct GeoGoal, a benchmark synthesized via a rigorous formal verification data engine, which converts abstract proofs into verifiable numeric subgoals. This structure reveals a critical divergence between reasoning quality and outcome accuracy. Leveraging this, we propose the Sub-Goal Verifiable Reward (SGVR) framework, which replaces sparse signals with dense rewards based on the Skeleton Rate. Experiments demonstrate that SGVR not only enhances geometric performance (+9.7%) but also exhibits strong generalization, transferring gains to general math (+8.0%) and other general reasoning tasks (+2.8%), demonstrating broad applicability across diverse domains.

### [338] [Sequential Subspace Noise Injection Prevents Accuracy Collapse in Certified Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05134)
*Polina Dolgova,Sebastian U. Stich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sequential noise scheduling improves practicality of certified unlearning by distributing noise across subspaces, maintaining privacy guarantees while boosting model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing certified unlearning methods based on differential privacy are impractical due to severe accuracy loss from noisy fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes sequential noise scheduling to distribute noise budget across orthogonal subspaces, mitigating accuracy loss while retaining privacy guarantees.

Result: Empirical results show improved accuracy post-unlearning and robustness to membership inference attacks.

Conclusion: Certified unlearning can achieve rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing practical utility.

Abstract: Certified unlearning based on differential privacy offers strong guarantees but remains largely impractical: the noisy fine-tuning approaches proposed so far achieve these guarantees but severely reduce model accuracy. We propose sequential noise scheduling, which distributes the noise budget across orthogonal subspaces of the parameter space, rather than injecting it all at once. This simple modification mitigates the destructive effect of noise while preserving the original certification guarantees. We extend the analysis of noisy fine-tuning to the subspace setting, proving that the same $(\varepsilon,δ)$ privacy budget is retained. Empirical results on image classification benchmarks show that our approach substantially improves accuracy after unlearning while remaining robust to membership inference attacks. These results show that certified unlearning can achieve both rigorous guarantees and practical utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FaST is a scalable framework for long-horizon and large-scale Spatial-Temporal Graph forecasting, using heterogeneity-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) to achieve one-week-ahead predictions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for Spatial-Temporal Graph forecasting are limited by short-horizon predictions, high computational costs, and memory issues when scaling to large graphs and long-term predictions.

Method: FaST introduces an adaptive graph agent attention mechanism to reduce computational burden and a parallel MoE module with Gated Linear Units (GLUs) for efficient and scalable parallel processing.

Result: Experiments show FaST outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in long-horizon predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: FaST successfully addresses the challenges of large-scale and long-horizon STG forecasting, offering a scalable and efficient solution with superior performance.

Abstract: Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) forecasting on large-scale networks has garnered significant attention. However, existing models predominantly focus on short-horizon predictions and suffer from notorious computational costs and memory consumption when scaling to long-horizon predictions and large graphs. Targeting the above challenges, we present FaST, an effective and efficient framework based on heterogeneity-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) for long-horizon and large-scale STG forecasting, which unlocks one-week-ahead (672 steps at a 15-minute granularity) prediction with thousands of nodes. FaST is underpinned by two key innovations. First, an adaptive graph agent attention mechanism is proposed to alleviate the computational burden inherent in conventional graph convolution and self-attention modules when applied to large-scale graphs. Second, we propose a new parallel MoE module that replaces traditional feed-forward networks with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), enabling an efficient and scalable parallel structure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FaST not only delivers superior long-horizon predictive accuracy but also achieves remarkable computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### [340] [An interpretable data-driven approach to optimizing clinical fall risk assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05194)
*Fardin Ganjkhanloo,Emmett Springer,Erik H. Hoyer,Daniel L. Young,Holley Farley,Kimia Ghobadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study improves fall risk prediction using a data-driven approach to adjust the JHFRAT scoring weights, enhancing performance and patient safety without changing the tool's structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better align fall risk prediction with clinically meaningful measures and improve patient safety in healthcare settings.

Method: Employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight JHFRAT scoring weights, preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds.

Result: CSO achieved AUC-ROC=0.91 vs. JHFRAT's 0.86, protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients weekly. CSO also showed robustness in risk labeling.

Conclusion: The CSO approach offers a robust, interpretable method to enhance fall risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare.

Abstract: In this study, we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

### [341] [Robust Reasoning as a Symmetry-Protected Topological Phase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05240)
*Ilmo Sung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a topological approach to address hallucinations in large language models, demonstrating robust inference through Symmetry-Protected Topological phases and outperforming traditional models like Transformers and RNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often exhibit hallucinations due to logical inconsistencies caused by semantic noise. The authors seek to address this by leveraging topological principles to ensure robust inference.

Method: The authors introduce a Holonomic Network that operates in a Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. They compare its performance against Transformers and RNNs.

Result: The Holonomic Network demonstrates a sharp topological phase transition, maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. It achieves perfect fidelity in symbolic manipulation tasks, extrapolating far beyond training limits, unlike Transformers.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold, and highlights the efficacy of topological approaches over traditional models.

Abstract: Large language models suffer from "hallucinations"-logical inconsistencies induced by semantic noise. We propose that current architectures operate in a "Metric Phase," where causal order is vulnerable to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic "mass gap," maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry. This provides strong evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold.

### [342] [Optimal Lower Bounds for Online Multicalibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05245)
*Natalie Collina,Jiuyao Lu,Georgy Noarov,Aaron Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tight lower bounds for online multicalibration are proven, showing a separation from marginal calibration. Results include Ω(T^(2/3)) bounds for group-dependent predictions and Ω̃(T^(2/3)) for context-dependent groups, matching existing upper bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to establish fundamental limits on multicalibration error, distinguishing it from marginal calibration and highlighting computational challenges.

Method: Lower bounds are derived using group functions dependent on context/predictions, employing disjoint binary groups and orthogonal function systems.

Result: For group-dependent predictions, Ω(T^(2/3)) error is proven; for context-dependent groups, Ω̃(T^(2/3)) is shown, both matching upper bounds.

Conclusion: The paper confirms tight lower bounds for multicalibration, separating it from marginal calibration and validating prior upper bounds.

Abstract: We prove tight lower bounds for online multicalibration, establishing an information-theoretic separation from marginal calibration.
  In the general setting where group functions can depend on both context and the learner's predictions, we prove an $Ω(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on expected multicalibration error using just three disjoint binary groups. This matches the upper bounds of Noarov et al. (2025) up to logarithmic factors and exceeds the $O(T^{2/3-\varepsilon})$ upper bound for marginal calibration (Dagan et al., 2025), thereby separating the two problems.
  We then turn to lower bounds for the more difficult case of group functions that may depend on context but not on the learner's predictions. In this case, we establish an $\widetildeΩ(T^{2/3})$ lower bound for online multicalibration via a $Θ(T)$-sized group family constructed using orthogonal function systems, again matching upper bounds up to logarithmic factors.
