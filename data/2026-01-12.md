### [1] [Bi-Orthogonal Factor Decomposition for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05328)
*Fenil R. Doshi,Thomas Fel,Talia Konkle,George Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BFD decomposes Vision Transformer attention into positional and content factors, revealing dominance of content interactions and specialization of attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what information (positional or semantic) attention mechanisms exchange between tokens in Vision Transformers.

Method: Introduces Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: ANOVA-based decomposition and SVD of query-key interaction matrix.

Result: Attention primarily operates through content; heads specialize in content-content, content-position, or position-position interactions; DINOv2 excels in holistic shape processing.

Conclusion: BFD clarifies token interactions in attention and their mediation by positional or semantic factors, offering insights into Vision Transformer mechanisms.

Abstract: Self-attention is the central computational primitive of Vision Transformers, yet we lack a principled understanding of what information attention mechanisms exchange between tokens. Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.
  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.

### [2] [Coding the Visual World: From Image to Simulation Using Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05344)
*Sagi Eppel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs can understand and model complex systems in images but struggle with fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore VLMs' ability to recognize and simulate systems depicted in images using the Im2Sim method.

Method: VLMs describe and generate code to simulate systems from images, producing synthetic images for comparison.

Result: VLMs show high-level system understanding but limited replication of fine details.

Conclusion: VLMs excel in abstract understanding but lack fine detail perception, revealing an asymmetry in visual comprehension.

Abstract: The ability to construct mental models of the world is a central aspect of understanding. Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image. These findings reveal an interesting asymmetry: VLMs combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details.

*Sudhakar Sah,Ravish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two new lightweight neural network families, STResNet for image classification and STYOLO for object detection, are introduced, achieving competitive accuracy and efficiency on resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight networks often sacrifice accuracy for latency, limiting their use on edge hardware like microcontrollers and NPUs.

Method: Developed STResNet (Nano to Tiny variants) for image classification and STYOLO (Micro and Milli variants) for object detection, optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and memory footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed models demonstrate superior performance in accuracy and efficiency for edge deployment, making them suitable for resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Recent advancements in lightweight neural networks have significantly improved the efficiency of deploying deep learning models on edge hardware. However, most existing architectures still trade accuracy for latency, which limits their applicability on microcontroller and neural processing unit based devices. In this work, we introduce two new model families, STResNet for image classification and STYOLO for object detection, jointly optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and memory footprint on resource constrained platforms. The proposed STResNet series, ranging from Nano to Tiny variants, achieves competitive ImageNet 1K accuracy within a four million parameter budget. Specifically, STResNetMilli attains 70.0 percent Top 1 accuracy with only three million parameters, outperforming MobileNetV1 and ShuffleNetV2 at comparable computational complexity. For object detection, STYOLOMicro and STYOLOMilli achieve 30.5 percent and 33.6 percent mean average precision, respectively, on the MS COCO dataset, surpassing YOLOv5n and YOLOX Nano in both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, when STResNetMilli is used as a backbone with the Ultralytics training environment.

### [4] [MOSAIC-GS: Monocular Scene Reconstruction via Advanced Initialization for Complex Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05368)
*Svitlana Morkva,Maximum Wilder-Smith,Michael Oechsle,Alessio Tonioni,Marco Hutter,Vaishakh Patil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSAIC-GS is a method for dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos using Gaussian Splatting, leveraging geometric cues and motion constraints for efficient and high-fidelity results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular reconstruction is challenging due to lack of multiview constraints, making it difficult to recover object geometry and temporal coherence accurately.

Method: The approach uses depth, optical flow, segmentation, and point tracking combined with rigidity-based constraints to estimate 3D dynamics. It decomposes scenes into static/dynamic parts, with dynamic Gaussians using Poly-Fourier curves for motion.

Result: MOSAIC-GS achieves faster optimization and rendering while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MOSAIC-GS offers an efficient and high-quality solution for monocular dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: We present MOSAIC-GS, a novel, fully explicit, and computationally efficient approach for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos using Gaussian Splatting. Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate recovery of object geometry and temporal coherence particularly challenging. To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding. We demonstrate that MOSAIC-GS achieves substantially faster optimization and rendering compared to existing methods, while maintaining reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art approaches across standard monocular dynamic scene benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble methods combining deep learning and radiomics outperform individual techniques in breast cancer detection from mammograms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early breast cancer diagnosis improves survival rates, and radiomics and deep learning offer promising tools for assisting radiologists.

Method: Used RSNA and TecSalud datasets; trained ConvNeXtV1-small on RSNA, developed radiomics models on TecSalud, and employed an ensemble approach.

Result: Ensemble method achieved highest AUC (0.87), outperforming ConvNeXtV1-small (0.83) and radiomics (0.80).

Conclusion: Ensemble methods combining DL and radiomics enhance breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. Radiomics and deep learning (DL) have shown significant potential in assisting radiologists with early cancer detection. This paper aims to critically assess the performance of radiomics, DL, and ensemble techniques in detecting cancer from screening mammograms. Two independent datasets were used: the RSNA 2023 Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (11,913 patients) and a Mexican cohort from the TecSalud dataset (19,400 patients). The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology. Results showed that the ensemble approach achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, compared to 0.83 for ConvNeXtV1-small and 0.80 for radiomics. In conclusion, ensemble methods combining DL and radiomics predictions significantly enhance breast cancer diagnosis from mammograms.

### [6] [EdgeLDR: Quaternion Low-Displacement Rank Neural Networks for Edge-Efficient Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05379)
*Vladimir Frants,Sos Agaian,Karen Panetta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeLDR combines quaternion neural networks with block-circulant matrices for efficient deep learning on edge devices, achieving significant compression and competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in deploying deep neural networks on edge devices by improving memory traffic and compute efficiency through structured quaternion layers.

Method: Introduces EdgeLDR framework with quaternion block-circulant layers, enabling FFT-based evaluation and efficient computation.

Result: FFT-based evaluation yields speedups and stable latency, with EdgeLDR layers providing significant compression and competitive accuracy in classification tasks.

Conclusion: EdgeLDR effectively combines parameter efficiency and structured computation, making it viable for resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on edge devices is often limited by the memory traffic and compute cost of dense linear operators. While quaternion neural networks improve parameter efficiency by coupling multiple channels through Hamilton products, they typically retain unstructured dense weights; conversely, structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in the real domain. This paper introduces EdgeLDR, a practical framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure and enables FFT-based evaluation through the complex adjoint representation. We present reference implementations of EdgeLDR layers and compare FFT-based computation against a naive spatial-domain realization of quaternion circulant products. FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over the naive implementation and keeps latency stable as block size increases, making larger compression factors computationally viable. We further integrate EdgeLDR layers into compact CNN and Transformer backbones and evaluate accuracy-compression trade-offs on 32x32 RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification (Houston 2013, Pavia University), reporting parameter counts and CPU/GPU latency. The results show that EdgeLDR layers provide significant compression with competitive accuracy.

### [7] [Sketch&Patch++: Efficient Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05394)
*Yuang Shi,Simone Gasparini,Géraldine Morin,Wei Tsang Ooi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid Gaussian representation categorizes Gaussians into Sketch Gaussians (high-frequency features) and Patch Gaussians (low-frequency regions), enabling efficient 3D scene streaming and rendering with improved quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance 3D scene representation by mimicking traditional artistic techniques, where distinct roles of Gaussians optimize structural and volumetric details for adaptive streaming and rendering.

Method: A hierarchical adaptive categorization framework uses multi-criteria density-based clustering and adaptive quality-driven refinement on 3DGS representation, eliminating reliance on external 3D line primitives.

Result: The method achieves up to 1.74 dB PSNR improvement, 6.7% SSIM, and 41.4% LPIPS gains at equivalent model sizes and maintains quality with only 0.5% of the original size for indoor scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-aware Gaussian representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and high-fidelity rendering for bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.

Abstract: We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail.
  In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.

### [8] [Multi-task Cross-modal Learning for Chest X-ray Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05399)
*Zhaohui Liang,Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman,Niccolo Marini,Zhiyun Xue,Sameer Antani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes fine-tuning BiomedCLIP for medical retrieval tasks, specifically CXR image-text retrieval, using a multi-task learning framework to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models like CLIP and BiomedCLIP lack optimization for fine-grained medical tasks, such as retrieving clinically relevant radiology reports using CXR images.

Method: A multi-task learning framework fine-tunes BiomedCLIP with an MLP projector and a composite loss function, including binary cross-entropy, supervised contrastive loss, and CLIP loss.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperforms BiomedCLIP and CLIP, achieving balanced performance in retrieval tasks and clearer semantic clustering of normal/abnormal cases.

Conclusion: Domain-adaptive, multi-task learning enhances cross-modal retrieval in biomedical applications.

Abstract: CLIP and BiomedCLIP are examples of vision-language foundation models and offer strong cross-modal embeddings; however, they are not optimized for fine-grained medical retrieval tasks, such as retrieving clinically relevant radiology reports using chest X-ray (CXR) image queries. To address this shortcoming, we propose a multi-task learning framework to fine-tune BiomedCLIP and evaluate improvements to CXR image-text retrieval. Using BiomedCLIP as the backbone, we incorporate a lightweight MLP projector head trained with a multi-task composite loss function that includes: (1) a binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish normal from abnormal CXR studies, (2) a supervised contrastive loss to reinforce intra-class consistency, and (3) a CLIP loss to maintain cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to the pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP models. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations reveal clearer semantic clustering of normal and abnormal cases, demonstrating the model's enhanced diagnostic sensitivity. These findings highlight the value of domain-adaptive, multi-task learning for advancing cross-modal retrieval in biomedical applications.

### [9] [Thinking with Map: Reinforced Parallel Map-Augmented Agent for Geolocalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05432)
*Yuxiang Ji,Yong Wang,Ziyu Ma,Yiming Hu,Hailang Huang,Xuecai Hu,Guanhua Chen,Liaoni Wu,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geolocalization method called 'Thinking with Map,' which combines map-based reasoning with agentic reinforcement learning and parallel test-time scaling, achieving significant accuracy improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models for geolocalization overlook human-like map usage. The authors aim to bridge this gap by integrating map-based reasoning and optimizing agentic capabilities.

Method: The proposed approach uses a two-stage optimization: agentic reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance sampling efficiency and parallel test-time scaling (TTS) for exploring multiple candidate paths before prediction.

Result: The method outperforms existing models, notably improving Acc@500m from 8.0% to 22.1% compared to Gemini-3-Pro with Google Search/Map grounded mode.

Conclusion: Integrating map-based reasoning and two-stage optimization significantly enhances geolocalization accuracy, as validated by the new MAPBench benchmark.

Abstract: The image geolocalization task aims to predict the location where an image was taken anywhere on Earth using visual clues. Existing large vision-language model (LVLM) approaches leverage world knowledge, chain-of-thought reasoning, and agentic capabilities, but overlook a common strategy used by humans -- using maps. In this work, we first equip the model \textit{Thinking with Map} ability and formulate it as an agent-in-the-map loop. We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS). The RL strengthens the agentic capability of model to improve sampling efficiency, and the parallel TTS enables the model to explore multiple candidate paths before making the final prediction, which is crucial for geolocalization. To evaluate our method on up-to-date and in-the-wild images, we further present MAPBench, a comprehensive geolocalization training and evaluation benchmark composed entirely of real-world images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\% to 22.1\% compared to \textit{Gemini-3-Pro} with Google Search/Map grounded mode.

### [10] [TAPM-Net: Trajectory-Aware Perturbation Modeling for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05446)
*Hongyang Xie,Hongyang He,Victor Sanchez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPM-Net, a novel network for infrared small target detection, models target-induced feature disturbances spatially and directionally, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack mechanisms to trace small targets' directional feature perturbations, essential for distinguishing signals from noise in infrared scenes.

Method: TAPM-Net uses a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) to extract feature trajectories and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB) for dynamic propagation modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K datasets.

Conclusion: TAPM-Net effectively addresses the challenge of ISTD by modeling spatial diffusion behavior, offering anisotropic state transitions at low computational cost.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) remains a long-standing challenge due to weak signal contrast, limited spatial extent, and cluttered backgrounds. Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.

### [11] [ROAP: A Reading-Order and Attention-Prior Pipeline for Optimizing Layout Transformers in Key Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05470)
*Tingwei Xie,Jinxin He,Yonghong Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROAP enhances VrDU by addressing logical reading order and visual token interference via AXG-Tree and RO-RPB, improving performance without altering pre-trained backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Multimodal Transformers' performance in visually-rich document understanding by tackling poor logical reading order modeling and visual token interference.

Method: ROAP uses AXG-Tree for hierarchical reading sequences, RO-RPB for attention integration, and TT-Prior to reduce visual noise and enhance text interactions.

Result: ROAP boosts performance on FUNSD and CORD benchmarks for models like LayoutLMv3 and GeoLayoutLM.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling reading logic and managing modality interference are key for robust document understanding, with ROAP providing a scalable solution.

Abstract: The efficacy of Multimodal Transformers in visually-rich document understanding (VrDU) is critically constrained by two inherent limitations: the lack of explicit modeling for logical reading order and the interference of visual tokens that dilutes attention on textual semantics.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents ROAP, a lightweight and architecture-agnostic pipeline designed to optimize attention distributions in Layout Transformers without altering their pre-trained backbones.
  The proposed pipeline first employs an Adaptive-XY-Gap (AXG-Tree) to robustly extract hierarchical reading sequences from complex layouts. These sequences are then integrated into the attention mechanism via a Reading-Order-Aware Relative Position Bias (RO-RPB). Furthermore, a Textual-Token Sub-block Attention Prior (TT-Prior) is introduced to adaptively suppress visual noise and enhance fine-grained text-text interactions.
  Extensive experiments on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks demonstrate that ROAP consistently improves the performance of representative backbones, including LayoutLMv3 and GeoLayoutLM.
  These findings confirm that explicitly modeling reading logic and regulating modality interference are critical for robust document understanding, offering a scalable solution for complex layout analysis. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/ROAP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel underground imaging system uses deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) to enhance root visibility and detail, outperforming existing methods and enabling better root trait analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate imaging of plant roots underground is challenging due to occlusion, soil moisture, and low contrast, hindering conventional vision-based methods.

Method: Proposes a MISR framework that integrates multiple overlapping views and leverages spatial redundancy to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved clarity. Uses a synthetic dataset simulating realistic underground conditions for training and evaluation.

Result: Quantitative improvements include a 2.3% reduction in BRISQUE (indicating better image quality) and maintains CLIP-IQA score. Enables precise measurement of root traits like hair count and density.

Conclusion: The framework advances underground root imaging, supporting agricultural and ecological research with automated, accurate trait quantification.

Abstract: Understanding plant root systems is critical for advancing research in soil-plant interactions, nutrient uptake, and overall plant health. However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density. The proposed framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification for agricultural and ecological research.

*Trishna Niraula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study uses MRI scans to show hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) versus controls and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with hippocampal volume moderately predicting MCI-to-AD conversion, but no genetic effects from APOE4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate gray matter loss, especially hippocampal atrophy, in AD and MCI progression using advanced neuroimaging techniques.

Method: Applied CAT12/SPM12 voxel-based morphometry to baseline T1-weighted MRI scans from 249 ADNI participants, using diagnostic group as primary predictor and adjusting for age and intracranial volume. Statistical analysis included voxelwise and cluster-level corrections.

Result: Found significant hippocampal atrophy in AD versus controls (Cohen's d=2.03) and MCI (d=1.61), with hippocampal volume moderately predicting MCI-to-AD conversion (AUC=0.66). APOE4 status had no significant effect on hippocampal volume.

Conclusion: Medial temporal degeneration is central to AD progression, with hippocampal atrophy as a key biomarker. Genetic effects were minimal, emphasizing structural changes over APOE4 influence.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are associated with progressive gray matter loss, particularly in medial temporal structures. In this study, CAT12/SPM12 voxel-based morphometry was applied to baseline T1-weighted MRI scans from 249 ADNI participants (CN = 90, MCI = 129, AD = 30). Gray matter volume was analyzed using a general linear model, with the diagnostic group as primary predictor and age and total intracranial volume as covariates. Statistical maps were thresholded at p < 0.001 (voxelwise) and corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level using family-wise error (FWE) correction (p < 0.05). Significant hippocampal atrophy was observed in AD relative to CN and MCI (Cohen's d = 2.03 and 1.61, respectively). Hippocampal volume demonstrated moderate predictive value for conversion from MCI to AD (AUC = 0.66). Stratification by APOE4 status did not reveal significant genetic effects on cross-sectional hippocampal volume. These results support medial temporal degeneration as a key feature of AD progression and provide insights into predictive biomarkers and genetic influences.

*Zizhong Li,Haopeng Zhang,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMViR introduces a multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation for long video understanding, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long videos due to complex events, diverse scenes, and long-range dependencies, leading to redundant or fragmented content.

Method: MMViR identifies key turning points to segment videos and constructs a three-level description combining global narratives with fine-grained details.

Result: MMViR outperforms prior methods by 19.67% in hour-long video understanding and reduces processing latency to 45.4%.

Conclusion: MMViR effectively addresses challenges in long video understanding, offering efficient query-based retrieval and generalization across scenarios.

Abstract: Long videos, ranging from minutes to hours, present significant challenges for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to their complex events, diverse scenes, and long-range dependencies. Direct encoding of such videos is computationally too expensive, while simple video-to-text conversion often results in redundant or fragmented content. To address these limitations, we introduce MMViR, a novel multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation for long video understanding. MMViR identifies key turning points to segment the video and constructs a three-level description that couples global narratives with fine-grained visual details. This design supports efficient query-based retrieval and generalizes well across various scenarios. Extensive evaluations across three tasks, including QA, summarization, and retrieval, show that MMViR outperforms the prior strongest method, achieving a 19.67% improvement in hour-long video understanding while reducing processing latency to 45.4% of the original.

*Samuel E. Johnny,Bernes L. Atabonfack,Israel Alagbe,Assane Gueye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework for breast ultrasound imaging, combining lesion segmentation and classification using SAM embeddings, achieving high accuracy and Dice scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in BUS imaging like low contrast and diverse lesion morphology necessitate advanced methods for accurate tumor segmentation and classification.

Method: A prompt-free, supervised adaptation of SAM features is used with lightweight convolutional heads or UNet decoders for segmentation, and mask-guided attention enhances classification.

Result: Achieves DSC of 0.887 and accuracy of 92.3% on the PRECISE 2025 dataset, ranking highly on the challenge leaderboard.

Conclusion: SAM-based representations with segmentation-guided learning improve lesion delineation and diagnostic prediction in BUS imaging.

Abstract: Accurate tumor segmentation and classification in breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging remain challenging due to low contrast, speckle noise, and diverse lesion morphology. This study presents a multi-task deep learning framework that jointly performs lesion segmentation and diagnostic classification using embeddings from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) vision encoder. Unlike prompt-based SAM variants, our approach employs a prompt-free, fully supervised adaptation where high-dimensional SAM features are decoded through either a lightweight convolutional head or a UNet-inspired decoder for pixel-wise segmentation. The classification branch is enhanced via mask-guided attention, allowing the model to focus on lesion-relevant features while suppressing background artifacts. Experiments on the PRECISE 2025 breast ultrasound dataset, split per class into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing, show that the proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.887 and an accuracy of 92.3 percent, ranking among the top entries on the PRECISE challenge leaderboard. These results demonstrate that SAM-based representations, when coupled with segmentation-guided learning, significantly improve both lesion delineation and diagnostic prediction in breast ultrasound imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieroSA is a framework enabling MLLMs to analyze hieroglyphic stroke structures automatically, improving cross-lingual generalization without needing script-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and MLLMs fail to model the structural logic of hieroglyphs, which encode rich semantic and cultural information. Existing methods are script-specific and labor-intensive.

Method: HieroSA transforms character images into interpretable line-segment representations in a normalized coordinate space, bypassing language-specific priors.

Result: Experiments show HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics.

Conclusion: HieroSA serves as a powerful graphematics analysis tool for hieroglyphic scripts.

Abstract: Hieroglyphs, as logographic writing systems, encode rich semantic and cultural information within their internal structural composition. Yet, current advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) usually remain structurally blind to this information. LLMs process characters as textual tokens, while MLLMs additionally view them as raw pixel grids. Both fall short to model the underlying logic of character strokes. Furthermore, existing structural analysis methods are often script-specific and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a novel and generalizable framework that enables MLLMs to automatically derive stroke-level structures from character bitmaps without handcrafted data. It transforms modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphs character images into explicit, interpretable line-segment representations in a normalized coordinate space, allowing for cross-lingual generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics, bypassing the need for language-specific priors. Experimental results highlight the potential of our work as a graphematics analysis tool for a deeper understanding of hieroglyphic scripts. View our code at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/HieroSA.

*Xuan Cheng,Jiahao Rao,Chengyang Li,Wenhao Wang,Weilin Chen,Lvqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianSwap is a new video face-swapping framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic avatars, outperforming pixel-based methods in identity preservation and interactivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video face-swapping methods lack dynamic control and interactivity, relying on static pixel representations.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting tied to FLAME parameters, camera poses, and segmentation masks, with a compound identity embedding for accuracy.

Result: Achieves better identity preservation, clarity, and temporal consistency, enabling interactive applications.

Conclusion: GaussianSwap marks a shift from pixel-based to avatar-based face swapping, offering superior performance and flexibility.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianSwap, a novel video face swapping framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting based face avatar from a target video while transferring identity from a source image to the avatar. Conventional video swapping frameworks are limited to generating facial representations in pixel-based formats. The resulting swapped faces exist merely as a set of unstructured pixels without any capacity for animation or interactive manipulation. Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning. Finally, we render the face-swapped avatar on the background frames to obtain the face-swapped video. Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianSwap achieves superior identity preservation, visual clarity and temporal consistency, while enabling previously unattainable interactive applications.

*Qiwei Yang,Pingping Zhang,Yuhao Wang,Zijing Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAS-VPReID is a novel framework for video-based person re-identification at extreme far distances, combining memory-enhanced visual features, multi-granularity temporal modeling, and shape dynamics priors to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based person re-identification is challenging at extreme far distances due to low resolution, viewpoint changes, and appearance noise.

Method: Proposes SAS-VPReID with three modules: Memory-Enhanced Visual Backbone for feature extraction, Multi-Granularity Temporal Modeling for motion cues, and Prior-Regularized Shape Dynamics for body structure.

Result: Achieves top performance on the VReID-XFD benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of each module.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in VPReID at extreme distances and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Video-based Person Re-IDentification (VPReID) aims to retrieve the same person from videos captured by non-overlapping cameras. At extreme far distances, VPReID is highly challenging due to severe resolution degradation, drastic viewpoint variation and inevitable appearance noise. To address these issues, we propose a Scale-Adaptive framework with Shape Priors for VPReID, named SAS-VPReID. The framework is built upon three complementary modules. First, we deploy a Memory-Enhanced Visual Backbone (MEVB) to extract discriminative feature representations, which leverages the CLIP vision encoder and multi-proxy memory. Second, we propose a Multi-Granularity Temporal Modeling (MGTM) to construct sequences at multiple temporal granularities and adaptively emphasize motion cues across scales. Third, we incorporate Prior-Regularized Shape Dynamics (PRSD) to capture body structure dynamics. With these modules, our framework can obtain more discriminative feature representations. Experiments on the VReID-XFD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and our final framework ranks the first on the VReID-XFD challenge leaderboard.

*Yiming Sun,Zifan Ye,Qinghua Hu,Pengfei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIFF-MF is a novel difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion, addressing imbalances in preserving infrared intensity and visible details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either prioritize infrared intensity at the expense of visible details or vice versa, leading to suboptimal fusion results.

Method: DIFF-MF uses feature discrepancy maps to guide extraction and fusion across channel (via cross-attention dual state space modeling) and spatial (via cross-modal state space scanning) dimensions.

Result: Experiments on driving and UAV datasets show DIFF-MF outperforms existing methods in visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: DIFF-MF effectively integrates multi-modal features by balancing channel-wise and spatial fusion, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple source images to produce high-quality fused images with enriched content. Although existing approaches based on state space model have achieved satisfied performance with high computational efficiency, they tend to either over-prioritize infrared intensity at the cost of visible details, or conversely, preserve visible structure while diminishing thermal target salience. To overcome these challenges, we propose DIFF-MF, a novel difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion. Our approach leverages feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by a fusion process across both channel and spatial dimensions. In the channel dimension, a channel-exchange module enhances channel-wise interaction through cross-attention dual state space modeling, enabling adaptive feature reweighting. In the spatial dimension, a spatial-exchange module employs cross-modal state space scanning to achieve comprehensive spatial fusion. By efficiently capturing global dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, DIFF-MF effectively integrates complementary multi-modal features. Experimental results on the driving scenarios and low-altitude UAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGen is a user-friendly multi-object image generation method that improves alignment between language descriptions and image regions, addressing inconsistencies in object quantities and attributes. It uses Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) and Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) modules for precise control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with precise alignment of localized image regions and language semantics, leading to inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. Dependency on external controls limits flexibility.

Method: MoGen introduces RSA for anchoring phrase units to image regions and AMG for adaptive integration of multi-source controls, enabling dynamic fine-grained control.

Result: MoGen outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, offering superior accessibility and flexibility.

Conclusion: MoGen effectively addresses limitations of current multi-object image generation methods, providing precise alignment and flexible control without rigid dependencies.

Abstract: Existing multi-object image generation methods face difficulties in achieving precise alignment between localized image generation regions and their corresponding semantics based on language descriptions, frequently resulting in inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility.

TL;DR: VIB-Probe is a novel framework using Variational Information Bottleneck theory to detect and mitigate hallucinations in Vision-Language Models by analyzing internal attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suffer from hallucinations where generated text deviates from visual content, and current detection methods overlook internal mechanisms.

Method: Proposes VIB-Probe to extract discriminative patterns from attention heads using Variational Information Bottleneck theory, filtering noise and enabling inference-time intervention.

Result: VIB-Probe outperforms existing baselines in hallucination detection and mitigation across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses hallucinations in VLMs by leveraging internal attention signals and offers public code for further research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, but remain susceptible to hallucinations, where generated text deviates from the underlying visual content. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings. Our code will be made publicly available.

*Bin-Bin Gao,Chengjie Wang*

TL;DR: UniADet simplifies universal visual anomaly detection by decoupling classification and segmentation tasks and cross-level features, using minimal learnable parameters while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual-language models for anomaly detection involve complex prompt engineering and adaptation modules, limiting flexibility and generality. UniADet addresses these inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed framework decouples classification and segmentation tasks and cross-level features, learning independent weights for each. It eliminates the need for a language encoder in anomaly detection.

Result: UniADet surpasses state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot and full-shot methods on 14 benchmarks across industrial and medical domains, using only 0.002M parameters.

Conclusion: UniADet provides a simple, parameter-efficient, and highly effective solution for universal anomaly detection, adaptable to various foundational models.

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify anomaly images and segment anomaly regions towards open and dynamic scenarios, following zero- and few-shot paradigms without any dataset-specific fine-tuning. We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains. We will make the code and model of UniADet available at https://github.com/gaobb/UniADet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm using Dynamic Threshold Adjustment and Selective Negative Learning achieves state-of-the-art results without full labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled facial expression data is costly to acquire, necessitating efficient semi-supervised methods.

Method: Uses Dynamic Threshold Adjustment and Selective Negative Learning, with local attention enhancement and random dropout for robust feature extraction.

Result: Achieves top performance on RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets, surpassing fully supervised methods without full labeled data.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages unlabeled data and adapts dynamically, proving superior to traditional supervised approaches.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is a key task in human-computer interaction and affective computing. However, acquiring a large amount of labeled facial expression data is often costly. Therefore, it is particularly important to design a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm that makes full use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets. Our method surpasses fully supervised methods even without using the entire dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our approach.

*Fanxiao Li,Jiaying Wu,Tingchao Fu,Dayang Li,Herun Wan,Wei Zhou,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OMGuard, a pipeline addressing interpretation drift caused by misleading social-media news previews, improving detection and correction through multimodal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading social-media news previews can subtly distort readers' understanding by omitting context, a harm less detectable than explicit misinformation.

Method: Developed MM-Misleading benchmark, evaluated LVLMs, and proposed OMGuard with Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning and Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction.

Result: OMGuard improved detection accuracy and correction effectiveness, identifying local narrative shifts and visual-driven misleading scenarios.

Conclusion: Multimodal interventions are essential for addressing misleading previews, with OMGuard demonstrating significant improvements over existing LVLMs.

Abstract: Even when factually correct, social-media news previews (image-headline pairs) can induce interpretation drift: by selectively omitting crucial context, they lead readers to form judgments that diverge from what the full article conveys. This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding, enabling construction of the MM-Misleading benchmark. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate open-source LVLMs and uncover pronounced blind spots to omission-based misleadingness detection. We further propose OMGuard, which integrates (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning, which used to improve multimodal misleadingness detection and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction, which uses explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting and reduce misleading impressions. Experiments show that OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers markedly stronger end-to-end correction. Further analysis reveals that misleadingness typically stems from local narrative shifts (e.g., missing background) rather than global frame changes, and identifies image-driven scenarios where text-only correction fails, highlighting the necessity of visual interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of UMMs in maintaining visual consistency and disambiguating cues across multiple input images.

Method: Introduce learnable latent separators and sinusoidal index encoding for disentangled conditioning and generalization.

Result: Improvements in semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and cross-image integration over prior baselines.

Conclusion: The framework validates advantages in consistency and generalization for multi-image editing tasks.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate multimodal understanding and generation, yet they are limited to maintaining visual consistency and disambiguating visual cues when referencing details across multiple input images. In this work, we propose a scalable multi-image editing framework for UMMs that explicitly distinguishes image identities and generalizes to variable input counts. Algorithmically, we introduce two innovations: 1) The learnable latent separators explicitly differentiate each reference image in the latent space, enabling accurate and disentangled conditioning. 2) The sinusoidal index encoding assigns visual tokens from the same image a continuous sinusoidal index embedding, which provides explicit image identity while allowing generalization and extrapolation on a variable number of inputs. To facilitate training and evaluation, we establish a high-fidelity benchmark using an inverse dataset construction methodology to guarantee artifact-free, achievable outputs. Experiments show clear improvements in semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and cross-image integration over prior baselines on diverse multi-image editing tasks, validating our advantages on consistency and generalization ability.

Method: Key methods include scalable 3D asset synthesis, model-in-the-loop annotation, symmetry-aware periodic distribution fitting, and multi-frame architecture for relative rotation prediction.

Result: Orient Anything V2 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on orientation estimation, 6DoF pose estimation, and symmetry recognition across 11 benchmarks, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: The model significantly advances orientation estimation capabilities, demonstrating broad applicability and superior performance in diverse tasks.

Abstract: This work presents Orient Anything V2, an enhanced foundation model for unified understanding of object 3D orientation and rotation from single or paired images. Building upon Orient Anything V1, which defines orientation via a single unique front face, V2 extends this capability to handle objects with diverse rotational symmetries and directly estimate relative rotations. These improvements are enabled by four key innovations: 1) Scalable 3D assets synthesized by generative models, ensuring broad category coverage and balanced data distribution; 2) An efficient, model-in-the-loop annotation system that robustly identifies 0 to N valid front faces for each object; 3) A symmetry-aware, periodic distribution fitting objective that captures all plausible front-facing orientations, effectively modeling object rotational symmetry; 4) A multi-frame architecture that directly predicts relative object rotations. Extensive experiments show that Orient Anything V2 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on orientation estimation, 6DoF pose estimation, and object symmetry recognition across 11 widely used benchmarks. The model demonstrates strong generalization, significantly broadening the applicability of orientation estimation in diverse downstream tasks.

TL;DR: A novel three-stage domain continual learning framework is proposed to adaptively detect AI-generated images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of detecting evolving AI-generated images due to rapid advancements in generative models.

Method: A three-stage approach: fine-tuning for generalization, continual learning with data augmentation and K-FAC, and capturing model commonalities via Linear Mode Connectivity.

Result: Offline detectors improved mean average precision by +5.51%, and continual learning achieved 92.20% accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively adapts to new generative models, enhancing detection performance.

Abstract: The malicious misuse and widespread dissemination of AI-generated images pose a significant threat to the authenticity of online information. Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 27 generative models, including GANs, deepfakes, and diffusion models, chronologically structured up to August 2024 to simulate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our initial offline detectors surpass the leading baseline by +5.51% in terms of mean average precision. Our continual learning strategy achieves an average accuracy of 92.20%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing convergence rate and rendering quality in 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, especially for complex motions.

Conclusion: GS-DMSR effectively enhances modeling efficiency and performance in dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: In the field of 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, how to balance model convergence rate and rendering quality has long been a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed, particularly in high-precision modeling of scenes with complex dynamic motions. To tackle this issue, this study proposes the GS-DMSR method. By quantitatively analyzing the dynamic evolution process of Gaussian attributes, this mechanism achieves adaptive gradient focusing, enabling it to dynamically identify significant differences in the motion states of Gaussian models. It then applies differentiated optimization strategies to Gaussian models with varying degrees of significance, thereby significantly improving the model convergence rate. Additionally, this research integrates a multi-scale manifold enhancement module, which leverages the collaborative optimization of an implicit nonlinear decoder and an explicit deformation field to enhance the modeling efficiency for complex deformation scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a frame rate of up to 96 FPS on synthetic datasets, while effectively reducing both storage overhead and training time.Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GS-DMSR-2212.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new metric evaluates dataset shape-texture balance, and a method adjusts max-pooling dilation to enhance shape bias in CNNs, improving performance on shape-dominant datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs favor textures over shapes, which harms performance on shape-dominant data. Existing solutions lack a quantitative way to identify datasets needing shape bias.

Method: Proposes a metric using SSIM to quantify shape-texture balance, and adjusts max-pooling dilation to enhance shape bias without retraining convolutional weights.

Result: The method improves classification accuracy on shape-dominant datasets, especially in low-data settings, by training only the final layer.

Conclusion: The proposed metric and adaptation method effectively address CNN texture bias, enhancing performance on shape-focused datasets efficiently.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to exhibit a strong texture bias, favoring local patterns over global shape information--a tendency inherent to their convolutional architecture. While this bias is beneficial for texture-rich natural images, it often degrades performance on shape-dominant data such as illustrations and sketches. Although prior work has proposed shape-biased models to mitigate this issue, these approaches lack a quantitative metric for identifying which datasets would actually benefit from such modifications. To address this gap, we propose a data-driven metric that quantifies the shape-texture balance of a dataset by computing the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between each image's luminance channel and its L0-smoothed counterpart. Building on this metric, we further introduce a computationally efficient adaptation method that promotes shape bias by modifying the dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen. Experimental results show that this approach consistently improves classification accuracy on shape-dominant datasets, particularly in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical, requiring training only the final classification layer.

TL;DR: SceneAlign improves multimodal reasoning by using scene graphs to create contrastive pairs, enhancing visual grounding and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models often fail in complex visual scenes due to hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, and skipped steps. Existing methods rely on textual perturbations, which bypass visual grounding.

Method: SceneAlign uses scene graphs for controllable structural interventions, identifying critical nodes and perturbing them to create hard negative rationales. These are used in Direct Preference Optimization to improve reasoning faithfulness.

Result: SceneAlign consistently enhances answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness across seven visual reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for improving multimodal reasoning in complex visual scenes.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models often struggle with faithful reasoning in complex visual scenes, where intricate entities and relations require precise visual grounding at each step. This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning. Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for multimodal reasoning.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on Gait3D, GREW, CCPG, and SUSTech1K datasets across various gait conditions.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling gait variations as geometric transformations leads to effective identity-invariant feature learning, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: The goal of gait recognition is to extract identity-invariant features of an individual under various gait conditions, e.g., cross-view and cross-clothing. Most gait models strive to implicitly learn the common traits across different gait conditions in a data-driven manner to pull different gait conditions closer for recognition. However, relatively few studies have explicitly explored the inherent relations between different gait conditions. For this purpose, we attempt to establish connections among different gait conditions and propose a new perspective to achieve gait recognition: variations in different gait conditions can be approximately viewed as a combination of geometric transformations. In this case, all we need is to determine the types of geometric transformations and achieve geometric invariance, then identity invariance naturally follows. As an initial attempt, we explore three common geometric transformations (i.e., Reflect, Rotate, and Scale) and design a $\mathcal{R}$eflect-$\mathcal{R}$otate-$\mathcal{S}$cale invariance learning framework, named ${\mathcal{RRS}}$-Gait. Specifically, it first flexibly adjusts the convolution kernel based on the specific geometric transformations to achieve approximate feature equivariance. Then these three equivariant-aware features are respectively fed into a global pooling operation for final invariance-aware learning. Extensive experiments on four popular gait datasets (Gait3D, GREW, CCPG, SUSTech1K) show superior performance across various gait conditions.

TL;DR: LatentVLA is a framework that improves autonomous driving models by addressing limitations like numerical imprecision, linguistic bias, and inefficiency in Vision-Language-Action models. It uses self-supervised latent action prediction and knowledge distillation for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving models struggle with rare scenarios and face challenges like numerical imprecision, linguistic bias, and computational inefficiency in Vision-Language-Action models.

Method: LatentVLA employs self-supervised latent action prediction to train without language annotations and uses knowledge distillation to transfer capabilities to efficient vision-based networks.

Result: LatentVLA achieves a PDMS score of 92.4 on NAVSIM and shows strong zero-shot generalization on nuScenes.

Conclusion: LatentVLA addresses key challenges in autonomous driving models, offering robust performance and real-time efficiency.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained on largescale datasets perform well in common scenarios but struggle with rare, long-tail situations due to limited scenario diversity. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage broad knowledge from pre-trained visionlanguage models to address this limitation, yet face critical challenges: (1) numerical imprecision in trajectory prediction due to discrete tokenization, (2) heavy reliance on language annotations that introduce linguistic bias and annotation burden, and (3) computational inefficiency from multi-step chain-of-thought reasoning hinders real-time deployment. We propose LatentVLA, a novel framework that employs self-supervised latent action prediction to train VLA models without language annotations, eliminating linguistic bias while learning rich driving representations from unlabeled trajectory data. Through knowledge distillation, LatentVLA transfers the generalization capabilities of VLA models to efficient vision-based networks, achieving both robust performance and real-time efficiency. LatentVLA establishes a new state-of-the-art on the NAVSIM benchmark with a PDMS score of 92.4 and demonstrates strong zeroshot generalization on the nuScenes benchmark.

TL;DR: Proposes a method to reduce encoder size in deep learning models for image compression using simplified knowledge distillation, maintaining quality while being resource-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for image compression are often too complex and resource-heavy for hardware-constrained applications, necessitating lighter solutions.

Method: Simplified knowledge distillation is used to approximate the latent space of original heavyweight encoders, reducing their size and training requirements.

Result: Lightweight encoders preserve reconstruction quality and statistical fidelity better than traditional training methods.

Conclusion: The approach is practical for resource-limited environments, offering a balance between performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Deep learning models for image compression often face practical limitations in hardware-constrained applications. Although these models achieve high-quality reconstructions, they are typically complex, heavyweight, and require substantial training data and computational resources. We propose a methodology to partially compress these networks by reducing the size of their encoders. Our approach uses a simplified knowledge distillation strategy to approximate the latent space of the original models with less data and shorter training, yielding lightweight encoders from heavyweight ones. We evaluate the resulting lightweight encoders across two different architectures on the image compression task. Experiments show that our method preserves reconstruction quality and statistical fidelity better than training lightweight encoders with the original loss, making it practical for resource-limited environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGDrive enhances VLMs for autonomous driving by structuring representation learning around driving-specific hierarchies (scene-agent-goal), improving performance on NAVSIM benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs lack specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning, struggling with spatial-temporal representations critical for safe planning.

Method: SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy, mirroring human cognition, and integrates this into a pre-trained VLM backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NAVSIM benchmarks (PDMS and EPDMS) among camera-only methods.

Conclusion: Hierarchical knowledge structuring effectively adapts generalist VLMs to autonomous driving, addressing their limitations.

Abstract: Recent end-to-end autonomous driving approaches have leveraged Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance planning capabilities in complex driving scenarios. However, VLMs are inherently trained as generalist models, lacking specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time. When applied to autonomous driving, these models struggle to establish structured spatial-temporal representations that capture geometric relationships, scene context, and motion patterns critical for safe trajectory planning. To address these limitations, we propose SGDrive, a novel framework that explicitly structures the VLM's representation learning around driving-specific knowledge hierarchies. Built upon a pre-trained VLM backbone, SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition: drivers first perceive the overall environment (scene context), then attend to safety-critical agents and their behaviors, and finally formulate short-term goals before executing actions. This hierarchical decomposition provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that SGDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance among camera-only methods on both PDMS and EPDMS, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical knowledge structuring for adapting generalist VLMs to autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchVL, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), introduces FinePO, a novel RL algorithm for fine-grained credit assignment, improving chart understanding by 7.23% over base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated chart understanding is challenging for MLLMs due to complex visual reasoning and poor credit assignment in existing RL-trained models.

Method: SketchVL uses FinePO, an RL algorithm with a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM), to score each reasoning step by drawing intermediate markers on images.

Result: SketchVL achieves a 7.23% performance gain over its base model across chart, natural image, and math datasets.

Conclusion: FinePO enables fine-grained reinforcement signals, offering a promising direction for training powerful reasoning models.

Abstract: Charts are high-density visual carriers of complex data and medium for information extraction and analysis. Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.

Conclusion: RCM provides a robust solution for high-quality 3D character generation and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D characters from single images remains a significant challenge in digital content creation, particularly due to complex body poses and self-occlusion. In this paper, we present RCM (Rotate your Character Model), an advanced image-to-video diffusion framework tailored for high-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) and 3D character generation. Compared to existing diffusion-based approaches, RCM offers several key advantages: (1) transferring characters with any complex poses into a canonical pose, enabling consistent novel view synthesis across the entire viewing orbit, (2) high-resolution orbital video generation at 1024x1024 resolution, (3) controllable observation positions given different initial camera poses, and (4) multi-view conditioning supporting up to 4 input images, accommodating diverse user scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques like GRPO struggle with consistent reward improvements in image-to-video models. TAGRPO addresses this gap.

Method: Uses contrastive learning and a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, alongside a memory bank for rollout videos.

Result: TAGRPO outperforms DanceGRPO in image-to-video generation, showing significant improvements.

Conclusion: TAGRPO is a simple yet effective solution for enhancing reward consistency in image-to-video models.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of integrating Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into flow matching models, particularly for text-to-image and text-to-video generation. However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve SLAM systems by integrating strong semantics beyond basic RGB-D input, enabling new downstream tasks and enhancing tracking and mapping accuracy.

Method: Unifies camera tracking with photorealistic mapping via 3D Gaussian Splatting, incorporating dense feature rasterization aligned with a visual foundation model.

Result: Achieves 9% lower pose error and 8% higher mapping accuracy compared to baselines, with real-time performance and improved stability.

Conclusion: FeatureSLAM enhances both tracking and mapping subsystems, enabling new applications while matching offline model performance.

Abstract: We present a real-time tracking SLAM system that unifies efficient camera tracking with photorealistic feature-enriched mapping using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our main contribution is integrating dense feature rasterization into the novel-view synthesis, aligned with a visual foundation model. This yields strong semantics, going beyond basic RGB-D input, aiding both tracking and mapping accuracy. Unlike previous semantic SLAM approaches (which embed pre-defined class labels) FeatureSLAM enables entirely new downstream tasks via free-viewpoint, open-set segmentation. Across standard benchmarks, our method achieves real-time tracking, on par with state-of-the-art systems while improving tracking stability and map fidelity without prohibitive compute. Quantitatively, we obtain 9\% lower pose error and 8\% higher mapping accuracy compared to recent fixed-set SLAM baselines. Our results confirm that real-time feature-embedded SLAM, is not only valuable for enabling new downstream applications. It also improves the performance of the underlying tracking and mapping subsystems, providing semantic and language masking results that are on-par with offline 3DGS models, alongside state-of-the-art tracking, depth and RGB rendering.

TL;DR: ViTNT-FIQA is a training-free method for face image quality assessment by analyzing patch embedding stability across ViT blocks, achieving competitive performance with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FIQA methods rely on final-layer representations or require multiple passes/backpropagation. ViTNT-FIQA addresses this by leveraging intermediate block stability.

Method: Measures stability of patch embeddings across ViT blocks using Euclidean distances between L2-normalized embeddings from consecutive blocks, aggregating into quality scores.

Result: Validated on synthetic datasets and outperforms benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.), showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ViTNT-FIQA offers computational efficiency, requires no backpropagation/modifications, and works with any pre-trained ViT model.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) is essential for reliable face recognition systems. Current approaches primarily exploit only final-layer representations, while training-free methods require multiple forward passes or backpropagation. We propose ViTNT-FIQA, a training-free approach that measures the stability of patch embedding evolution across intermediate Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels. Unlike existing training-free approaches, ViTNT-FIQA requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation or architectural modifications. Through extensive evaluation on eight benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, IJB-C), we show that ViTNT-FIQA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and immediate applicability to any pre-trained ViT-based face recognition model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs operate near humans for various applications, requiring accurate perception of human poses from aerial viewpoints, which current methods struggle with due to resolution, angles, and occlusion.

Method: FlyPose uses a top-down pipeline trained on multi-dataset inputs, including Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV, and a custom dataset.

Result: Achieves 6.8 mAP improvement in detection and 16.3 mAP in pose estimation, with ~20ms inference latency on Jetson Orin AGX.

Conclusion: FlyPose offers efficient, accurate aerial human pose estimation, demonstrated in flight tests, and introduces FlyPose-104 dataset for further research.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in close proximity to humans for applications such as parcel delivery, traffic monitoring, disaster response and infrastructure inspections. Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint. This perspective challenges existing methods with low resolution, steep viewing angles and (self-)occlusion, especially if the application demands realtime feasibile models. We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset. For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ~20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments. We also publish FlyPose-104, a small but challenging aerial human pose estimation dataset, that includes manual annotations from difficult aerial perspectives: https://github.com/farooqhassaan/FlyPose.

TL;DR: ADRL addresses multi-view multi-label learning challenges by feature completion, disentangled representation, and label semantics modeling, achieving robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle feature absence and incomplete annotations in multi-view multi-label learning, overcoming limitations in feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling.

Method: ADRL uses feature-level affinity propagation, stochastic masking, mutual-information-based objectives, and prototype-specific feature selection with pseudo-label generation.

Result: ADRL demonstrates superior performance in experiments on public datasets and real-world applications.

Conclusion: ADRL effectively addresses multi-view multi-label learning challenges through innovative representation learning and feature completion techniques.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label learning frequently suffers from simultaneous feature absence and incomplete annotations, due to challenges in data acquisition and cost-intensive supervision. To tackle the complex yet highly practical problem while overcoming the existing limitations of feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling, we propose an Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning method (ADRL). ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category. The structural characteristics of the pseudo-label space are then exploited to guide a discriminative trade-off during view fusion. Finally, extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of ADRL.

Motivation: Existing methods lack functional complexity, especially for articulated objects crucial for robotic manipulation and navigation.

Method: Uses LLM for layout generation and diffusion-based sampling for populating scenes with articulated assets, guided by differentiable functions.

Result: Produces structurally valid, semantically coherent, and interactive 3D environments suitable for scalable AI research.

Conclusion: SceneFoundry advances robotic learning by generating realistic, functional 3D environments efficiently.

Abstract: The ability to automatically generate large-scale, interactive, and physically realistic 3D environments is crucial for advancing robotic learning and embodied intelligence. However, existing generative approaches often fail to capture the functional complexity of real-world interiors, particularly those containing articulated objects with movable parts essential for manipulation and navigation. This paper presents SceneFoundry, a language-guided diffusion framework that generates apartment-scale 3D worlds with functionally articulated furniture and semantically diverse layouts for robotic training. From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates structurally valid, semantically coherent, and functionally interactive environments across diverse scene types and conditions, enabling scalable embodied AI research.

TL;DR: Send-VAE improves semantic disentanglement in VAEs by aligning latent spaces with VFMs, enhancing image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods use the same alignment targets for VAEs and LDMs, ignoring their different representational needs. VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement.

Method: Proposes Send-VAE, optimized for disentangled representation learning by aligning its latent space with VFMs' semantic hierarchy using a non-linear mapper network.

Result: Send-VAE improves semantic disentanglement (measured via linear probing) and generation performance, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores.

Conclusion: Send-VAE bridges attribute-level disentanglement and high-level semantics, significantly improving VAE performance in image generation tasks.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) generate high-quality images by operating in a compressed latent space, typically obtained through image tokenizers such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In pursuit of a generation-friendly VAE, recent studies have explored leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as representation alignment targets for VAEs, mirroring the approach commonly adopted for LDMs. Although this yields certain performance gains, using the same alignment target for both VAEs and LDMs overlooks their fundamentally different representational requirements. We advocate that while LDMs benefit from latents retaining high-level semantic concepts, VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement, enabling encoding of attribute-level information in a structured way. To address this, we propose the Semantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE), explicitly optimized for disentangled representation learning through aligning its latent space with the semantic hierarchy of pre-trained VFMs. Our approach employs a non-linear mapper network to transform VAE latents, aligning them with VFMs to bridge the gap between attribute-level disentanglement and high-level semantics, facilitating effective guidance for VAE learning. We evaluate semantic disentanglement via linear probing on attribute prediction tasks, showing strong correlation with improved generation performance. Finally, using Send-VAE, we train flow-based transformers SiTs; experiments show Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 and 1.75 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256x256.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving, but prior methods overlook inherent geometric structure.

Method: Utilizes foundation models as pseudo geometry priors, introduces a view synthesis pipeline with dense depth reconstruction, and employs adaptive joint motion learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DDAD and nuScenes datasets.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the importance of geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.

Abstract: Accurate surround-view depth estimation provides a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors and is essential for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving. While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with specifying precise goals for dynamic tasks, as text instructions are too abstract and target images are often infeasible.

Method: The authors train a video generation model on synthetic causal primitives (e.g., elastic collisions, falling dominos) to propagate forces through time and space, grounding the model in fundamental physics.

Result: The model demonstrates zero-shot generalization to complex real-world scenarios like tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains, despite being trained on simple physics data.

Conclusion: Grounding video generation in physical interactions allows models to function as implicit neural physics simulators, facilitating precise and physics-aware planning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the development of ``world models'' capable of simulating potential futures for robotics and planning. However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines. We release all datasets, code, model weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

The method combines Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIMs), and Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQ-GANs). Unlike prior slice-wise approaches, our method operates directly on an image volume and leverages weak supervision with only case-level pseudo-labels. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art supervised segmentation and detection models. This study demonstrates the feasibility and promise of 3D latent diffusion for weakly supervised anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The framework advances high-fidelity 3D human asset creation, with potential for practical use in virtual try-ons and immersive experiences.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decomposing arbitrarily posed humans into animatable multi-layered 3D human avatars, separating the body and garments. Conventional single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. We overcome both limitations by encoding each layer as a set of 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, and inpainting hidden regions with a pretrained 2D diffusion model via score-distillation sampling (SDS). Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

### [48] [Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction for Semi-Supervised Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05855)
*Kaiwen Huang,Yizhe Zhang,Yi Zhou,Tianyang Xu,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a BCSI framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, addressing error accumulation and noise through SSP, CR, and BCI strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised methods suffer from error accumulation, structural complexity, and lack of interaction between labeled and unlabeled data.

Method: Introduces SSP for data perturbation and consistency, CR for selective channel interaction, and BCI for semantic enhancement.

Result: Outperforms existing semi-supervised methods on multiple 3D medical datasets.

Conclusion: The BCSI framework effectively improves segmentation accuracy by addressing key limitations in current approaches.

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an effective method for addressing scenarios with limited labeled data. Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.

*Zhen-Xin Lin,Shang-Kuan Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phase4DFD is a phase-aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that leverages phase information via attention to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods focus on spectral magnitude and underutilize phase information, which may contain crucial manipulation artifacts.

Method: Phase4DFD combines RGB, FFT magnitude, and LBP representations, using a learnable phase-aware attention module to highlight manipulation artifacts. It employs a BNext M backbone with optional channel-spatial attention.

Result: Phase4DFD outperforms state-of-the-art detectors on CIFAKE and DFFD datasets, confirming phase information's complementary role.

Conclusion: Explicit phase modeling enhances deepfake detection, providing non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only approaches.

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection methods have increasingly explored frequency domain representations to reveal manipulation artifacts that are difficult to detect in the spatial domain. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction. The attended multi domain representation is processed by an efficient BNext M backbone, with optional channel spatial attention applied for semantic feature refinement. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model Phase4DFD outperforms state of the art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that explicit phase modeling provides complementary and non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations.

*Yohann Perron,Vladyslav Sydorov,Christophe Pottier,Loic Landrieu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using relay tokens in vision transformers to segment ultra high-resolution images, balancing local detail and global context without significant parameter increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with ultra high-resolution image segmentation, either losing global context or fine details.

Method: Proposes parallel processing at local (high-res) and global (low-res) scales with relay tokens to aggregate features between branches.

Result: Achieves consistent gains, up to 15% relative mIoU improvement on benchmarks like Archaeoscape and Cityscapes.

Conclusion: The method effectively preserves detail and context with minimal added parameters, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Current approaches for segmenting ultra high resolution images either slide a window, thereby discarding global context, or downsample and lose fine detail. We propose a simple yet effective method that brings explicit multi scale reasoning to vision transformers, simultaneously preserving local details and global awareness. Concretely, we process each image in parallel at a local scale (high resolution, small crops) and a global scale (low resolution, large crops), and aggregate and propagate features between the two branches with a small set of learnable relay tokens. The design plugs directly into standard transformer backbones (eg ViT and Swin) and adds fewer than 2 % parameters. Extensive experiments on three ultra high resolution segmentation benchmarks, Archaeoscape, URUR, and Gleason, and on the conventional Cityscapes dataset show consistent gains, with up to 15 % relative mIoU improvement. Code and pretrained models are available at https://archaeoscape.ai/work/relay-tokens/ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Vision Transformer-based model showed strong performance for segmenting pancreatic tumors in EUS images, but challenges like dataset heterogeneity and occasional errors call for further refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic cancer's poor survival rates and the subjectivity of EUS diagnosis motivated the development of a deep learning segmentation model to improve accuracy.

Method: The study used a Vision Transformer backbone within the USFM framework, trained and validated on 17,367 EUS images via 5-fold cross-validation, and tested on an independent dataset of 350 images.

Result: The model achieved mean DSC of 0.651, IoU of 0.579, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5% in validation, with slightly better performance in external testing.

Conclusion: While promising, the model requires further refinement due to dataset heterogeneity and occasional errors, emphasizing the need for standardization and prospective studies.

Abstract: Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers, with poor survival rates. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on an independent dataset of 350 EUS images from another public dataset, manually segmented by radiologists. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%. Results were consistent, but 9.7% of cases exhibited erroneous multiple predictions. Conclusions: The Vision Transformer-based model demonstrated strong performance for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS images. However, dataset heterogeneity and limited external validation highlight the need for further refinement, standardization, and prospective studies.

### [52] [Context-Aware Decoding for Faithful Vision-Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05939)
*Mehrdad Fazli,Bowen Wei,Ziwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) and introduces Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a training-free method to reduce inconsistencies in tasks like image captioning. CEI leverages layer-wise generation dynamics to improve visual fidelity, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LVLMs, where responses don't match visual inputs, are a major limitation in tasks like image captioning and visual reasoning. The study aims to understand the mechanisms behind hallucinations and develop an effective mitigation strategy.

Method: The authors analyze layer-wise generation dynamics using the Logit Lens and identify a commitment-depth gap between truthful and hallucinatory tokens. They propose CEI, a method that uses the hidden state of the last input token (context embedding) to maintain visual fidelity.

Result: Evaluated on benchmarks like CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench, CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with its dynamic variant achieving the lowest hallucination rates.

Conclusion: The study combines mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention (CEI) to effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs, advancing the field of vision-language modeling.

Abstract: Hallucinations, generating responses inconsistent with the visual input, remain a critical limitation of large vision-language models (LVLMs), especially in open-ended tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.

*Chanchan Wang,Yuanfang Wang,Qing Xu,Guanxin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveRNet is a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation, addressing domain shift challenges by integrating frequency-domain information and refining SAM's limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in retinal vessel segmentation due to non-uniform illumination and varying contrast, along with SAM's oversight of frequency-domain information and loss of fine details, motivates this work.

Method: WaveRNet introduces a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM), Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF), and Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) to leverage wavelet decomposition and refine segmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on four retinal datasets under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol.

Conclusion: WaveRNet effectively addresses domain shift and preserves fine vessel details, demonstrating superior generalization for retinal vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation is critical for automated ophthalmic diagnosis, yet faces significant challenges from domain shift induced by non-uniform illumination and varying contrast, compounded by the difficulty of preserving fine vessel structures. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot capabilities, existing SAM-based methods rely on simple adapter fine-tuning while overlooking frequency-domain information that encodes domain-invariant features, resulting in degraded generalization under illumination and contrast variations. Furthermore, SAM's direct upsampling inevitably loses fine vessel details. To address these limitations, we propose WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we devise a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) that integrates wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, enabling the separation of illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency vessel boundaries while facilitating domain-specific feature generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) module that performs intelligent test-time domain selection through wavelet-based frequency similarity and soft-weighted fusion. Finally, we present a Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) that overcomes SAM's upsampling limitation through coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate that WaveRNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAR is a scalable, efficient autoregressive framework for video generation, combining multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling to improve long-term consistency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational intensity and scalability issues of existing diffusion and flow-matching models in video generation.

Method: Uses intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer. Introduces techniques like Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask for consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 and reducing inference steps by over 10x, while matching performance of larger diffusion models.

Conclusion: VideoAR bridges the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion models, offering a scalable and efficient solution for video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been dominated by diffusion and flow-matching models, which produce high-quality results but remain computationally intensive and difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger. These results demonstrate that VideoAR narrows the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, offering a scalable, efficient, and temporally consistent foundation for future video generation research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AC-CAR is a contrast-agnostic deformable image registration framework using random convolution-based augmentation and feature modulation for generalizability to unseen imaging contrasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformable multi-contrast image registration is complex due to non-linear intensity relationships, and existing methods lack generalizability.

Method: Proposes AC-CAR with adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) and variance network for contrast-invariant feature learning and uncertainty estimation.

Result: AC-CAR outperforms baseline methods in accuracy and generalizes better to unseen contrasts.

Conclusion: AC-CAR offers a reliable, contrast-agnostic solution for deformable image registration.

Abstract: Deformable multi-contrast image registration is a challenging yet crucial task due to the complex, non-linear intensity relationships across different imaging contrasts. Conventional registration methods typically rely on iterative optimization of the deformation field, which is time-consuming. Although recent learning-based approaches enable fast and accurate registration during inference, their generalizability remains limited to the specific contrasts observed during training. In this work, we propose an adaptive conditional contrast-agnostic deformable image registration framework (AC-CAR) based on a random convolution-based contrast augmentation scheme. AC-CAR can generalize to arbitrary imaging contrasts without observing them during training. To encourage contrast-invariant feature learning, we propose an adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) that adaptively modulates the features and the contrast-invariant latent regularization to enforce the consistency of the learned feature across different imaging contrasts. Additionally, we enable our framework to provide contrast-agnostic registration uncertainty by integrating a variance network that leverages the contrast-agnostic registration encoder to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of AC-CAR. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-CAR outperforms baseline methods in registration accuracy and exhibits superior generalization to unseen imaging contrasts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combines LLM-generated embeddings with lightweight transaction models to improve semantic understanding and operational efficiency in payment network analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the semantic information loss in current transaction analysis models and the computational challenges of using LLMs in real-time financial applications.

Method: The approach uses LLM-generated embeddings for semantic initialization, multi-source data fusion for merchant field enrichment, and noise filtering for data quality.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvements in transaction understanding tasks on large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework effectively balances semantic richness with computational efficiency, enhancing transaction analysis.

Abstract: The ubiquity of payment networks generates vast transactional data encoding rich consumer and merchant behavioral patterns. Recent foundation models for transaction analysis process tabular data sequentially but rely on index-based representations for categorical merchant fields, causing substantial semantic information loss by converting rich textual data into discrete tokens. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can address this limitation through superior semantic understanding, their computational overhead challenges real-time financial deployment. We introduce a hybrid framework that uses LLM-generated embeddings as semantic initializations for lightweight transaction models, balancing interpretability with operational efficiency. Our approach employs multi-source data fusion to enrich merchant categorical fields and a one-word constraint principle for consistent embedding generation across LLM architectures. We systematically address data quality through noise filtering and context-aware enrichment. Experiments on large-scale transaction datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple transaction understanding tasks.

*Tim Menzner,Jochen L. Leidner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study shifts focus from political spectrum labels to how bias is expressed linguistically in news sentences, developing a detailed taxonomy of 38 bias types categorized into six families and visualized as a 'table of media-bias elements.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public debates often oversimplify media bias by categorizing outlets as left- or right-wing, ignoring the nuanced linguistic maneuvers that convey bias. This study aims to uncover these subtle expressions.

Method: The research analyzed 26,464 sentences from various sources, combining close-reading, interdisciplinary theory, and pilot annotation to create a fine-grained taxonomy of media bias and propaganda.

Result: The study produced a two-tier schema with 38 bias types grouped into six functional families, along with definitions, examples, and recognition guidance. A quantitative survey showed prevalence differences, and comparisons with other taxonomies revealed improved coverage and clarity.

Conclusion: The developed taxonomy provides a more precise and comprehensive tool for identifying media bias at the sentence level, surpassing existing frameworks in clarity and coverage.

Abstract: Public debates about "left-" or "right-wing" news overlook the fact that bias is usually conveyed by concrete linguistic manoeuvres that transcend any single political spectrum. We therefore shift the focus from where an outlet allegedly stands to how partiality is expressed in individual sentences. Drawing on 26,464 sentences collected from newsroom corpora, user submissions and our own browsing, we iteratively combine close-reading, interdisciplinary theory and pilot annotation to derive a fine-grained, sentence-level taxonomy of media bias and propaganda. The result is a two-tier schema comprising 38 elementary bias types, arranged in six functional families and visualised as a "table of media-bias elements". For each type we supply a definition, real-world examples, cognitive and societal drivers, and guidance for recognition. A quantitative survey of a random 155-sentence sample illustrates prevalence differences, while a cross-walk to the best-known NLP and communication-science taxonomies reveals substantial coverage gains and reduced ambiguity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates multilingual tool-calling robustness in LLMs, revealing failures due to language mismatch and partial mitigation via inference strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM tool-calling robustness beyond English, focusing on multilingual user interactions.

Method: Introduce MLCL benchmark; evaluate across Chinese, Hindi, and Igbo with fine-grained error analysis.

Result: Failures persist despite correct intent; parameter language mismatch is a key issue; inference strategies improve but don’t match English performance.

Conclusion: Current LLM tool-calling lacks full multilingual robustness; language mismatch remains a challenge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that invoke external tools through structured function calls. While recent work reports strong tool-calling performance under standard English-centric evaluations, the robustness of tool calling under multilingual user interactions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MLCL, a diagnostic benchmark, and conduct a systematic evaluation of multilingual tool calling across Chinese, Hindi, and the low-resource language Igbo. Through fine-grained error analysis, we show that many failures occur despite correct intent understanding and tool selection. We identify parameter value language mismatch as a dominant failure mode, where models generate semantically appropriate parameter values in the user's language, violating language-invariant execution conventions. We further evaluate several inference-time system strategies and find that while these strategies substantially reduce language-induced execution errors, none of them can fully recover English-level performance.

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit behavioral biases in financial contexts, prompting the creation of MFMDScen, a benchmark evaluating these biases across diverse economic scenarios using multilingual misinformation detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM bias research overlooks complex financial environments and multilingual misinformation detection tasks, necessitating a comprehensive benchmark.

Method: Constructed MFMDScen with three financial scenarios (role/personality, role/region, role/ethnicity/religion) and a multilingual dataset (English, Chinese, Greek, Bengali) to evaluate 22 LLMs.

Result: Pronounced behavioral biases found in both commercial and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: MFMDScen provides a systematic tool for assessing LLM biases in financial misinformation detection, highlighting persistent biases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied across various domains of finance. Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (\mfmd). In this work, we propose \mfmdscen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in \mfmd across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, \mfmdscen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models.

*Minda Zhao,Yilun Du,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs fail to consistently sample from specified probability distributions, especially in independent requests, impacting downstream tasks requiring statistical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for LLMs to reliably sample from probability distributions, a requirement for applications like educational assessment and synthetic data construction.

Method: The audit benchmarks 11 LLMs across 15 distributions using Batch Generation (N=1000 samples per response) and Independent Requests (N=1000 stateless calls).

Result: Batch generation shows modest validity (13% median pass rate), while independent requests collapse (10/11 models fail all distributions). Sampling fidelity worsens with complexity and sampling horizon.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack reliable internal samplers, necessitating external tools for tasks requiring statistical guarantees.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from chat interfaces to integral components of stochastic pipelines across domains like educational assessment and synthetic data construction, the ability to faithfully sample from specified probability distributions has become a functional requirement rather than a theoretical curiosity. We present the first large-scale, statistically powered audit of native probabilistic sampling in frontier LLMs, benchmarking 11 models across 15 distributions. To disentangle failure modes, we employ a dual-protocol design: Batch Generation, where a model produces N=1000 samples within one response, and Independent Requests, comprising $N=1000$ stateless calls. We observe a sharp protocol asymmetry: batch generation achieves only modest statistical validity, with a 13% median pass rate, while independent requests collapse almost entirely, with 10 of 11 models passing none of the distributions. Beyond this asymmetry, we reveal that sampling fidelity degrades monotonically with distributional complexity and aggravates as the requested sampling horizon N increases. Finally, we demonstrate the propagation of these failures into downstream tasks: models fail to enforce uniform answer-position constraints in MCQ generation and systematically violate demographic targets in attribute-constrained text-to-image prompt synthesis. These findings indicate that current LLMs lack a functional internal sampler, necessitating the use of external tools for applications requiring statistical guarantees.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores whether LLMs internally structure moral concepts like humans by analyzing two models using Moral Foundations Theory, layer-wise analysis, and causal interventions. Findings suggest moral foundations are represented in a structured, human-aligned way, with partially disentangled mechanisms and causal links to outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs' moral judgments reflect genuine internal conceptual structures or mere mimicry, using Moral Foundations Theory for deeper mechanistic insights.

Method: Multi-level analysis including layer-wise examination, sparse autoencoders for feature identification, and causal steering interventions with dense vectors and sparse features.

Result: Both models represent moral foundations in a structured, human-aligned manner, with SAE features linked to specific foundations and causal steering altering moral outputs predictably.

Conclusion: Moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, emerging from language statistics without explicit training, suggesting latent pluralistic moral structure.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce human-like moral judgments, but it is unclear whether this reflects an internal conceptual structure or superficial ``moral mimicry.'' Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone.

*Haoming Xu,Ningyuan Zhao,Yunzhi Yao,Weihong Xu,Hongru Wang,Xinle Deng,Shumin Deng,Jeff Z. Pan,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB) to measure belief robustness in LLMs, showing existing evaluations mask brittleness. NCB evaluates coherence under contextual interference, validated by experiments. Structure-Aware Training (SAT) improves belief stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations like Self-Consistency fail to capture brittle beliefs in LLMs, which can collapse under mild contextual perturbations. Reliable deployment requires more robust measures.

Method: Proposes NCB for evaluating belief robustness across conceptual neighborhoods and introduces SAT to optimize context-invariant belief structure.

Result: Experiments show high-NCB data resists interference better. SAT reduces knowledge brittleness by ~30%.

Conclusion: NCB and SAT address belief brittleness in LLMs, enhancing robustness for real-world deployment.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings, correctness alone is insufficient. Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%.

### [64] [Do LLMs Need Inherent Reasoning Before Reinforcement Learning? A Study in Korean Self-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05459)
*Hongjin Kim,Jaewook Lee,Kiyoung Lee,Jong-hun Shin,Soojong Lim,Oh-Woog Kwon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study shows that reinforcement learning (RL) alone isn't enough to improve Korean reasoning in LLMs; fine-tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers is key, leading to significant gains in reasoning and self-correction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning abilities in LLMs for low-resource languages like Korean, addressing the gap compared to high-resource languages like English.

Method: Investigates RL's impact, explores fine-tuning strategies (e.g., aligning Korean-specific neurons), and introduces a self-correction code-switching dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning Korean-specific neurons unlocks RL's effectiveness, yielding significant improvements in mathematical reasoning and self-correction.

Conclusion: Multilingual reasoning enhancement relies on aligning existing capabilities, not adding new linguistic knowledge, highlighting the role of internal translation and neuron-level tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and self-correction abilities in high-resource languages like English, but their performance remains limited in low-resource languages such as Korean. In this study, we investigate whether reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance Korean reasoning abilities to a degree comparable to English. Our findings reveal that RL alone yields limited improvements when applied to models lacking inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks. Ultimately, we conclude that the crucial factor in multilingual reasoning enhancement is not injecting new linguistic knowledge, but effectively eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities. Our study provides a new perspective on how internal translation and neuron-level tuning contribute to multilingual reasoning alignment in LLMs.

*Jingsheng Zheng,Jintian Zhang,Yujie Luo,Yuren Mao,Yunjun Gao,Lun Du,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to bypass the Execution Bottleneck in autonomous machine learning agents by using predictive reasoning instead of costly physical execution, achieving faster convergence and higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autonomous agents are limited by the Generate-Execute-Feedback paradigm, which is slowed by expensive physical execution. The paper aims to overcome this bottleneck.

Method: The authors internalize execution priors and use predictive reasoning, formalizing Data-centric Solution Preference and creating a corpus of 18,438 pairwise comparisons. LLMs are primed with Verified Data Analysis Reports for prediction.

Result: The method achieves 61.5% accuracy and robust confidence calibration. The FOREAGENT framework accelerates convergence by 6x and outperforms execution-based baselines by 6%.

Conclusion: Predictive reasoning can effectively substitute physical execution, offering significant speed and accuracy improvements for autonomous machine learning agents.

Abstract: Autonomous machine learning agents have revolutionized scientific discovery, yet they remain constrained by a Generate-Execute-Feedback paradigm. Previous approaches suffer from a severe Execution Bottleneck, as hypothesis evaluation relies strictly on expensive physical execution. To bypass these physical constraints, we internalize execution priors to substitute costly runtime checks with instantaneous predictive reasoning, drawing inspiration from World Models. In this work, we formalize the task of Data-centric Solution Preference and construct a comprehensive corpus of 18,438 pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLMs exhibit significant predictive capabilities when primed with a Verified Data Analysis Report, achieving 61.5% accuracy and robust confidence calibration. Finally, we instantiate this framework in FOREAGENT, an agent that employs a Predict-then-Verify loop, achieving a 6x acceleration in convergence while surpassing execution-based baselines by +6%. Our code and dataset will be publicly available soon at https://github.com/zjunlp/predict-before-execute.

*Zhihao Yuan,Yunze Xiao,Ming Li,Weihao Xuan,Richard Tong,Mona Diab,Tom Mitchell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for simulating students using LLMs, addressing the 'competence paradox' by focusing on epistemic fidelity through constrained generation and ESS. It also proposes a Goal-by-Environment framework and highlights open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unrealistic error patterns in LLM-based student simulations by ensuring epistemic fidelity rather than surface realism.

Method: Constrained generation governed by Epistemic State Specification (ESS) and a Goal-by-Environment framework.

Result: A formalized approach to designing LLM-based student simulations with focus on validity and ethical considerations.

Conclusion: Epistemic fidelity is crucial for reliable use of LLM-based student simulations in education.

Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and methodological framework for large language model (LLM) based student simulation in educational settings. The authors identify a core failure mode, termed the "competence paradox" in which broadly capable LLMs are asked to emulate partially knowledgeable learners, leading to unrealistic error patterns and learning dynamics. To address this, the paper reframes student simulation as a constrained generation problem governed by an explicit Epistemic State Specification (ESS), which defines what a simulated learner can access, how errors are structured, and how learner state evolves over time. The work further introduces a Goal-by-Environment framework to situate simulated student systems according to behavioral objectives and deployment contexts. Rather than proposing a new system or benchmark, the paper synthesizes prior literature, formalizes key design dimensions, and articulates open challenges related to validity, evaluation, and ethical risks. Overall, the paper argues for epistemic fidelity over surface realism as a prerequisite for using LLM-based simulated students as reliable scientific and pedagogical instruments.

*Herun Wan,Jiaying Wu,Minnan Luo,Fanxiao Li,Zhi Zeng,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are vulnerable to sophisticated misleading evidence despite resisting direct misinformation. The MisBelief framework exposes this weakness, and Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS) is proposed as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure LLMs maintain factual accuracy against deceptive evidence, as current models fail against refined misinformation.

Method: Introduces MisBelief, a framework generating misleading evidence via multi-role LLM interactions, and evaluates 7 LLMs using 4,800 instances across difficulty levels.

Result: Models are robust to direct misinformation but highly sensitive to refined falsehoods, with belief scores increasing by 93.0%. DIS mitigates this by detecting deceptive intent.

Conclusion: Sophisticated misleading evidence undermines LLMs' reliability, but DIS offers an effective governance mechanism to counteract this vulnerability.

Abstract: To reliably assist human decision-making, LLMs must maintain factual internal beliefs against misleading injections. While current models resist explicit misinformation, we uncover a fundamental vulnerability to sophisticated, hard-to-falsify evidence. To systematically probe this weakness, we introduce MisBelief, a framework that generates misleading evidence via collaborative, multi-round interactions among multi-role LLMs. This process mimics subtle, defeasible reasoning and progressive refinement to create logically persuasive yet factually deceptive claims. Using MisBelief, we generate 4,800 instances across three difficulty levels to evaluate 7 representative LLMs. Results indicate that while models are robust to direct misinformation, they are highly sensitive to this refined evidence: belief scores in falsehoods increase by an average of 93.0\%, fundamentally compromising downstream recommendations. To address this, we propose Deceptive Intent Shielding (DIS), a governance mechanism that provides an early warning signal by inferring the deceptive intent behind evidence. Empirical results demonstrate that DIS consistently mitigates belief shifts and promotes more cautious evidence evaluation.

*Zhiyu Shen,Ziming Wu,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian,Yanghui Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemBuilder is a reinforcement learning framework designed to improve long-term dialogue consistency in LLMs by addressing sparse rewards and multi-dimensional memory attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard retrieval mechanisms fail to capture temporal evolution in dialogues, and current memory-augmented systems rely on static prompting or ineffective training.

Method: MemBuilder uses synthetic session-level questions for dense rewards and contribution-aware gradient weighting for memory attribution.

Result: A 4B-parameter model trained with MemBuilder outperforms closed-source baselines and generalizes well across benchmarks.

Conclusion: MemBuilder effectively enhances long-term dialogue consistency through dense rewards and multi-dimensional memory management.

Abstract: Maintaining consistency in long-term dialogues remains a fundamental challenge for LLMs, as standard retrieval mechanisms often fail to capture the temporal evolution of historical states. While memory-augmented frameworks offer a structured alternative, current systems rely on static prompting of closed-source models or suffer from ineffective training paradigms with sparse rewards. We introduce MemBuilder, a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to orchestrate multi-dimensional memory construction with attributed dense rewards. MemBuilder addresses two key challenges: (1) Sparse Trajectory-Level Rewards: we employ synthetic session-level question generation to provide dense intermediate rewards across extended trajectories; and (2) Multi-Dimensional Memory Attribution: we introduce contribution-aware gradient weighting that scales policy updates based on each component's downstream impact. Experimental results show that MemBuilder enables a 4B-parameter model to outperform state-of-the-art closed-source baselines, exhibiting strong generalization across long-term dialogue benchmarks.

### [69] [FlashMem: Distilling Intrinsic Latent Memory via Computation Reuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05505)
*Yubo Hou,Zhisheng Chen,Tao Wan,Zengchang Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlashMem is a framework that integrates intrinsic memory into Large Language Models by reusing computation and leveraging hidden states, improving efficiency and long-term cognition without redundant processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stateless architectures of Large Language Models lack dynamic context preservation, leading to inefficiencies in handling long-horizon tasks. Existing memory solutions are segregated and rely on auxiliary encoders, which decouple memory from the reasoning process.

Method: FlashMem introduces a framework that distills intrinsic memory from transient reasoning states using computation reuse. It identifies the last hidden state as a sufficient statistic for interaction history and employs a Shared-KV Consolidator to synthesize memory by attending to the frozen cache. A parameter-free Cognitive Monitor uses attention entropy to trigger consolidation adaptively.

Result: FlashMem achieves performance comparable to heavy baselines while reducing inference latency by 5 times, effectively balancing efficiency and persistent cognition.

Conclusion: FlashMem successfully bridges the gap between efficiency and long-term memory in stateless architectures, offering a scalable solution for dynamic context preservation in Large Language Models.

Abstract: The stateless architecture of Large Language Models inherently lacks the mechanism to preserve dynamic context, compelling agents to redundantly reprocess history to maintain long-horizon autonomy. While latent memory offers a solution, current approaches are hindered by architectural segregation, relying on auxiliary encoders that decouple memory from the reasoning backbone. We propose FlashMem, a framework that distills intrinsic memory directly from transient reasoning states via computation reuse. Leveraging the property that internal representations uniquely encode input trajectories, FlashMem identifies the last hidden state as a sufficient statistic for the interaction history. This enables a Shared-KV Consolidator to synthesize memory by attending directly to the backbone's frozen cache, eliminating redundant re-parameterization. Furthermore, a parameter-free Cognitive Monitor leverages attention entropy to adaptively trigger consolidation only when high epistemic uncertainty is detected. Experiments demonstrate that FlashMem matches the performance of heavy baselines while reducing inference latency by 5 times, effectively bridging the gap between efficiency and persistent cognition.

### [70] [CHisAgent: A Multi-Agent Framework for Event Taxonomy Construction in Ancient Chinese Cultural Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05520)
*Xuemei Tang,Chengxi Yan,Jinghang Gu,Chu-Ren Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CHisAgent is a multi-agent LLM framework designed to automate historical taxonomy construction in ancient Chinese contexts, improving coherence and coverage compared to manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with historical and cultural reasoning, especially in non-English contexts like Chinese history. Taxonomic structures can organize knowledge, but manual construction is costly and hard to scale.

Method: CHisAgent uses three specialized stages: Inducer (bottom-up hierarchy creation), Expander (top-down introduction of missing concepts), and Enricher (integration of external historical resources).

Result: The framework constructs a large-scale event taxonomy from the Twenty-Four Histories, covering ancient China's politics, military, diplomacy, and social life. Evaluations show improved coherence and coverage.

Conclusion: CHisAgent effectively automates historical taxonomy construction, enhancing LLM performance in non-English contexts and supporting cross-cultural alignment.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on many tasks, large language models (LLMs) show limited ability in historical and cultural reasoning, particularly in non-English contexts such as Chinese history. Taxonomic structures offer an effective mechanism to organize historical knowledge and improve understanding. However, manual taxonomy construction is costly and difficult to scale. Therefore, we propose \textbf{CHisAgent}, a multi-agent LLM framework for historical taxonomy construction in ancient Chinese contexts. CHisAgent decomposes taxonomy construction into three role-specialized stages: a bottom-up \textit{Inducer} that derives an initial hierarchy from raw historical corpora, a top-down \textit{Expander} that introduces missing intermediate concepts using LLM world knowledge, and an evidence-guided \textit{Enricher} that integrates external structured historical resources to ensure faithfulness. Using the \textit{Twenty-Four Histories}, we construct a large-scale, domain-aware event taxonomy covering politics, military, diplomacy, and social life in ancient China. Extensive reference-free and reference-based evaluations demonstrate improved structural coherence and coverage, while further analysis shows that the resulting taxonomy supports cross-cultural alignment.

*Yuhao Shen,Tianyu Liu,Junyi Shen,Jinyang Wu,Quan Kong,Li Huan,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PSD accelerates Speculative Decoding via overlapping draft generation and verification but faces theoretical speedup limits and computational waste. Double introduces synchronous retrieval mechanisms to break limits and reduce rejections without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Parallel Speculative Decoding (PSD) methods are limited by theoretical speedup ceilings and inefficient token rejections. The goal is to overcome these challenges while maintaining efficiency and avoiding training overhead.

Method: Double employs a synchronous retrieval mechanism: the draft model iteratively retrieves speculations while the target model performs authoritative multi-token retrieval to guide generation. This avoids rollbacks and breaks speedup limits.

Result: Double achieves speedups of 5.3× on LLaMA3.3-70B and 2.8× on Qwen3-32B, outperforming EAGLE-3, which requires extensive training.

Conclusion: Double bridges SD and PSD gaps, offering training-free, lossless acceleration with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Parallel Speculative Decoding (PSD) accelerates traditional Speculative Decoding (SD) by overlapping draft generation with verification. However, it remains hampered by two fundamental challenges: (1) a theoretical speedup ceiling dictated by the speed ratio between the draft and target models, and (2) high computational waste and pipeline stall due to mid-sequence token rejections of early errors. To address these limitations, we introduce \textsc{Double} (Double Retrieval Speculative Parallelism). By bridging the gap between SD and PSD, our framework resolves the Retrieval \emph{Precision-Efficiency Dilemma} through a novel synchronous mechanism. Specifically, we enable the draft model to execute iterative retrieval speculations to break the theoretical speedup limits; to alleviate rejections without rollback, the target model performs authoritative retrieval to generate multi-token guidance. \textsc{Double} is entirely training-free and lossless. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art speedup of $\textbf{5.3}\times$ on LLaMA3.3-70B and $\textbf{2.8}\times$ on Qwen3-32B, significantly outperforming the advanced method EAGLE-3 that requires extensive model training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TARS, a reinforcement-learning framework, addresses the speech-text reasoning gap in large language models by aligning trajectories with asymmetric rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reasoning performance gap between speech and text inputs in large language models persists, possibly due to representational drift and behavior deviations.

Method: TARS uses reinforcement learning with asymmetric rewards, incorporating representation and behavior alignment signals.

Result: TARS significantly reduces the modality reasoning gap and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like MMSU and OBQA.

Conclusion: The framework effectively aligns speech and text trajectories, improving reasoning performance in speech-based large language models.

Abstract: Although speech large language models have achieved notable progress, a substantial modality reasoning gap remains: their reasoning performance on speech inputs is markedly weaker than on text. This gap could be associated with representational drift across Transformer layers and behavior deviations in long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce TARS, a reinforcement-learning framework that aligns text-conditioned and speech-conditioned trajectories through an asymmetric reward design. The framework employs two dense and complementary signals: representation alignment, which measures layer-wise hidden-state similarity between speech- and text-conditioned trajectories, and behavior alignment, which evaluates semantic consistency between generated outputs and reference text completions. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including MMSU and OBQA, show that our approach significantly narrows the modality reasoning gap and achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale Speech LLMs.

TL;DR: The study highlights flaws in AES and LLMs for detecting harmful essays, introduces HED benchmark, and calls for ethical improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in AES and LLMs' ability to identify and score harmful essays, focusing on ethical and moral content.

Method: Developed Harmful Essay Detection (HED) benchmark with essays on sensitive topics to evaluate LLMs.

Result: LLMs struggle to distinguish harmful from argumentative essays; AES and LLMs neglect ethical scoring.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the necessity for AES systems to better incorporate ethical considerations in scoring.

Abstract: This study addresses critical gaps in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) with regard to their ability to effectively identify and score harmful essays. Despite advancements in AES technology, current models often overlook ethically and morally problematic elements within essays, erroneously assigning high scores to essays that may propagate harmful opinions. In this study, we introduce the Harmful Essay Detection (HED) benchmark, which includes essays integrating sensitive topics such as racism and gender bias, to test the efficacy of various LLMs in recognizing and scoring harmful content. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs require further enhancement to accurately distinguish between harmful and argumentative essays, and (2) both current AES models and LLMs fail to consider the ethical dimensions of content during scoring. The study underscores the need for developing more robust AES systems that are sensitive to the ethical implications of the content they are scoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the KEEM dataset for improving memory updates in conversational systems by integrating emotional and factual data dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for memory updates in conversational systems often lead to conflicts and inaccuracies in tracking user states, lacking emotional and contextual depth.

Method: The KEEM dataset dynamically generates integrative memories, preserving essential facts and incorporating emotional context and causal relationships.

Result: The approach enhances empathy and response quality in open-domain conversations by updating memory with emotional and essential data.

Conclusion: KEEM advances conversational systems by enabling nuanced understanding and meaningful interactions through integrative memory updates.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Keep Emotional and Essential Memory (KEEM) dataset, a novel generation-based dataset designed to enhance memory updates in long-term conversational systems. Unlike existing approaches that rely on simple accumulation or operation-based methods, which often result in information conflicts and difficulties in accurately tracking a user's current state, KEEM dynamically generates integrative memories. This process not only preserves essential factual information but also incorporates emotional context and causal relationships, enabling a more nuanced understanding of user interactions. By seamlessly updating a system's memory with both emotional and essential data, our approach promotes deeper empathy and enhances the system's ability to respond meaningfully in open-domain conversations.

TL;DR: ReasonAny, a novel merging framework, resolves performance collapse in 'Reasoning + X' models by leveraging Contrastive Gradient Identification to retain reasoning and domain-specific capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of equipping domain-specialized models with reasoning capabilities without performance collapse motivates the development of ReasonAny.

Method: ReasonAny uses Contrastive Gradient Identification to merge models, focusing on parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity to preserve reasoning abilities.

Result: Experiments in safety, biomedicine, and finance show ReasonAny outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining robust reasoning performance.

Conclusion: ReasonAny effectively addresses the 'Reasoning + X' challenge by avoiding performance collapse and enhancing domain-specific utility.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with long chain-of-thought reasoning have recently achieved remarkable success. Yet, equipping domain-specialized models with such reasoning capabilities, referred to as "Reasoning + X", remains a significant challenge. While model merging offers a promising training-free solution, existing methods often suffer from a destructive performance collapse: existing methods tend to both weaken reasoning depth and compromise domain-specific utility. Interestingly, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon underlying this failure: reasoning ability predominantly resides in parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity, contrary to the common assumption that domain capabilities correspond to high-magnitude parameters. Motivated by this insight, we propose ReasonAny, a novel merging framework that resolves the reasoning-domain performance collapse through Contrastive Gradient Identification. Experiments across safety, biomedicine, and finance domains show that ReasonAny effectively synthesizes "Reasoning + X" capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while retaining robust reasoning performance.

*Sung-Yoo Lim,Koki Sato,Kiyoshi Takami,Giancarlos Parady,Eui-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TL;DR: The study explores using LLMs to automate the interpretation of group chat data for analyzing joint activity-travel decisions, focusing on eating-out activities in Japan. While LLMs excel at extracting explicit factors, they struggle with nuanced implicit ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage unstructured chat data for understanding complex joint decision-making processes in social activities, reducing reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation.

Method: A prompting framework inspired by knowledge acquisition extracts decision-making factors (e.g., restaurant choices, preferences) from group chats, converting unstructured data into structured tables. Quantitative and qualitative analyses compare LLM outputs with human-annotated ground truth.

Result: LLMs reliably capture explicit factors but struggle with nuanced implicit ones. Specific contexts are identified where LLM-based extraction is trustworthy versus requiring human oversight.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for automating annotation of non-traditional data but have limitations in handling implicit factors, emphasizing the need for human oversight in certain contexts.

Abstract: Social activities result from complex joint activity-travel decisions between group members. While observing the decision-making process of these activities is difficult via traditional travel surveys, the advent of new types of data, such as unstructured chat data, can help shed some light on these complex processes. However, interpreting these decision-making processes requires inferring both explicit and implicit factors. This typically involves the labor-intensive task of manually annotating dialogues to capture context-dependent meanings shaped by the social and cultural norms. This study evaluates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and complement human annotation in interpreting decision-making processes from group chats, using data on joint eating-out activities in Japan as a case study. We designed a prompting framework inspired by the knowledge acquisition process, which sequentially extracts key decision-making factors, including the group-level restaurant choice set and outcome, individual preferences of each alternative, and the specific attributes driving those preferences. This structured process guides the LLM to interpret group chat data, converting unstructured dialogues into structured tabular data describing decision-making factors. To evaluate LLM-driven outputs, we conduct a quantitative analysis using a human-annotated ground truth dataset and a qualitative error analysis to examine model limitations. Results show that while the LLM reliably captures explicit decision-making factors, it struggles to identify nuanced implicit factors that human annotators readily identified. We pinpoint specific contexts when LLM-based extraction can be trusted versus when human oversight remains essential. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based analysis for incorporating non-traditional data sources on social activities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Adaptive Context Refactoring (ACR) Framework to address issues like contextual inertia and state drift in LLMs during multi-turn dialogues, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with alignment, dependency tracking, and factual consistency in long interactions, and existing solutions fail to fully address contextual inertia and state drift.

Method: The ACR Framework dynamically monitors and reshapes interaction history using context refactoring operators and a teacher-guided training paradigm.

Result: ACR significantly outperforms baselines in multi-turn dialogue and reduces token consumption.

Conclusion: The ACR Framework effectively mitigates contextual inertia and state drift, improving LLM performance in multi-turn dialogues.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in multi-turn dialogue. However, in multi-turn dialogue, models still struggle to stay aligned with what has been established earlier, follow dependencies across many turns, and avoid drifting into incorrect facts as the interaction grows longer. Existing approaches primarily focus on extending the context window, introducing external memory, or applying context compression, yet these methods still face limitations such as \textbf{contextual inertia} and \textbf{state drift}. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}ontext \textbf{R}efactoring \textbf{(ACR)} Framework, which dynamically monitors and reshapes the interaction history to mitigate contextual inertia and state drift actively. ACR is built on a library of context refactoring operators and a teacher-guided self-evolving training paradigm that learns when to intervene and how to refactor, thereby decoupling context management from the reasoning process. Extensive experiments on multi-turn dialogue demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines while reducing token consumption.

Result: Detection accuracies: 61-72% (isiXhosa) and 72-86% (Yorùbá), with ROC-AUC up to 0.88. Rewriting detoxified all toxic sentences while keeping non-toxic ones intact.

Conclusion: The hybrid method is scalable, interpretable, and efficient for African languages, setting a new benchmark for low-resource Text Style Transfer.

Abstract: Toxic language is one of the major barrier to safe online participation, yet robust mitigation tools are scarce for African languages. This study addresses this critical gap by investigating automatic text detoxification (toxic to neutral rewriting) for two low-resource African languages, isiXhosa and Yorùbá. The work contributes a novel, pragmatic hybrid methodology: a lightweight, interpretable TF-IDF and Logistic Regression model for transparent toxicity detection, and a controlled lexicon- and token-guided rewriting component. A parallel corpus of toxic to neutral rewrites, which captures idiomatic usage, diacritics, and code switching, was developed to train and evaluate the model. The detection component achieved stratified K-fold accuracies of 61-72% (isiXhosa) and 72-86% (Yorùbá), with per-language ROC-AUCs up to 0.88. The rewriting component successfully detoxified all detected toxic sentences while preserving 100% of non-toxic sentences. These results demonstrate that scalable, interpretable machine learning detectors combined with rule-based edits offer a competitive and resource-efficient solution for culturally adaptive safety tooling, setting a new benchmark for low-resource Text Style Transfer (TST) in African languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in LLMs' 'practical wisdom' by proposing game-based informal learning and a Nested Training Framework to enhance generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in formal tasks but lack human-like 'practical wisdom.' Informal learning through games is proposed to bridge this gap.

Method: Introduces a Nested Training Framework using sequential task composition (explicit 'AND' objective) and GRPO-based reinforcement learning across games.

Result: Integrating game-based learning prevents task interference and improves generalization in broad ability-oriented benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLMs' diverse competencies through game-based informal learning.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in formal learning tasks such as mathematics and code generation, they still struggle with the "practical wisdom" and generalizable intelligence, such as strategic creativity and social reasoning, that characterize human cognition. This gap arises from a lack of informal learning, which thrives on interactive feedback rather than goal-oriented instruction. In this paper, we propose treating Games as a primary environment for LLM informal learning, leveraging their intrinsic reward signals and abstracted complexity to cultivate diverse competencies. To address the performance degradation observed in multi-task learning, we introduce a Nested Training Framework. Unlike naive task mixing optimizing an implicit "OR" objective, our framework employs sequential task composition to enforce an explicit "AND" objective, compelling the model to master multiple abilities simultaneously to achieve maximal rewards. Using GRPO-based reinforcement learning across Matrix Games, TicTacToe, and Who's the Spy games, we demonstrate that integrating game-based informal learning not only prevents task interference but also significantly bolsters the model's generalization across broad ability-oriented benchmarks. The framework and implementation are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores multilingual unlearning in large language models, focusing on data and concept unlearning across ten languages, revealing stability in high-resource languages and syntactic similarity as key predictor of unlearning behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in ensuring safety and fairness of multilingual language models, particularly in cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases.

Method: Uses the Aya-Expanse 8B model for data and concept unlearning; benchmarks extended to ten languages via translation.

Result: Unlearning in high-resource languages is more stable; syntactic similarity predicts cross-lingual unlearning behavior.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of linguistic similarity and resource levels in multilingual unlearning, aiding future model safety efforts.

Abstract: As multilingual large language models become more widely used, ensuring their safety and fairness across diverse linguistic contexts presents unique challenges. While existing research on machine unlearning has primarily focused on monolingual settings, typically English, multilingual environments introduce additional complexities due to cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases embedded in both pretraining and fine-tuning data. In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian. These languages span five language families and a wide range of resource levels. Our experiments show that unlearning in high-resource languages is generally more stable, with asymmetric transfer effects observed between typologically related languages. Furthermore, our analysis of linguistic distances indicates that syntactic similarity is the strongest predictor of cross-lingual unlearning behavior.

*Sejun Park,Yoonah Park,Jongwon Lim,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a context-aware user profiling framework to improve persuasiveness prediction by leveraging a persuadee's past activities, outperforming existing methods by up to +13.77%p F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack systematic frameworks to optimize persuasiveness prediction by considering a persuadee's characteristics and past activities.

Method: The proposed framework includes a query generator to retrieve relevant records from a user's history and a profiler to summarize these into informative profiles for prediction.

Result: Evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset showed consistent improvements, with gains up to +13.77%p F1 score.

Conclusion: Task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling is crucial for personalized persuasiveness prediction, emphasizing dynamic profiling over static attributes.

Abstract: Estimating the persuasiveness of messages is critical in various applications, from recommender systems to safety assessment of LLMs. While it is imperative to consider the target persuadee's characteristics, such as their values, experiences, and reasoning styles, there is currently no established systematic framework to optimize leveraging a persuadee's past activities (e.g., conversations) to the benefit of a persuasiveness prediction model. To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity. Together, these results highlight the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction.

TL;DR: Stephanie2 is a step-wise dialogue agent with active waiting and pacing adaptation, outperforming Stephanie1 in naturalness and engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI chatting systems lack active waiting and natural pacing, leading to unnatural conversations. Stephanie2 aims to address these issues.

Method: Stephanie2 uses active waiting and pacing adaptation, modeling latency as thinking and typing time. A dual-agent system generates pseudo dialogue histories for evaluation.

Result: Stephanie2 outperforms Stephanie1 in naturalness, engagement, and pass rate on human evaluation.

Conclusion: Stephanie2 improves conversational naturalness and engagement, demonstrating the effectiveness of its step-wise decision-making approach.

Abstract: Instant-messaging human social chat typically progresses through a sequence of short messages. Existing step-by-step AI chatting systems typically split a one-shot generation into multiple messages and send them sequentially, but they lack an active waiting mechanism and exhibit unnatural message pacing. In order to address these issues, we propose Stephanie2, a novel next-generation step-wise decision-making dialogue agent. With active waiting and message-pace adaptation, Stephanie2 explicitly decides at each step whether to send or wait, and models latency as the sum of thinking time and typing time to achieve more natural pacing. We further introduce a time-window-based dual-agent dialogue system to generate pseudo dialogue histories for human and automatic evaluations. Experiments show that Stephanie2 clearly outperforms Stephanie1 on metrics such as naturalness and engagement, and achieves a higher pass rate on human evaluation with the role identification Turing test.

TL;DR: Afri-MCQA introduces the first multilingual cultural QA benchmark for 15 African languages, highlighting LLMs' poor performance on native language/speech tasks and advocating for inclusive AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underrepresentation of African languages in AI research by creating a culturally and linguistically diverse benchmark.

Method: Developed Afri-MCQA with 7.5k parallel Q&A pairs across 15 African languages and English, created by native speakers. Benchmarked LLMs on text and speech tasks.

Result: Open-weight LLMs performed poorly, especially in native language/speech tasks, with significant gaps between native languages and English.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for speech-first approaches, culturally grounded pretraining, and cross-lingual cultural transfer in AI development for African languages.

Abstract: Africa is home to over one-third of the world's languages, yet remains underrepresented in AI research. We introduce Afri-MCQA, the first Multilingual Cultural Question-Answering benchmark covering 7.5k Q&A pairs across 15 African languages from 12 countries. The benchmark offers parallel English-African language Q&A pairs across text and speech modalities and was entirely created by native speakers. Benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on Afri-MCQA shows that open-weight models perform poorly across evaluated cultures, with near-zero accuracy on open-ended VQA when queried in native language or speech. To evaluate linguistic competence, we include control experiments meant to assess this specific aspect separate from cultural knowledge, and we observe significant performance gaps between native languages and English for both text and speech. These findings underscore the need for speech-first approaches, culturally grounded pretraining, and cross-lingual cultural transfer. To support more inclusive multimodal AI development in African languages, we release our Afri-MCQA under academic license or CC BY-NC 4.0 on HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Atnafu/Afri-MCQA)

TL;DR: MICL enables speech LLMs to learn and improve ASR for unseen languages using multimodal context, outperforming traditional methods without needing target-language data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of supervised data for ASR in low-resource languages by leveraging multimodal in-context learning with speech LLMs.

Method: Experiments with Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni on endangered languages, analyzing MICL's effectiveness, cross-lingual transfer, and attention patterns.

Result: MICL improves ASR performance, leveraging both speech and text, with cross-lingual transfer matching or outperforming corpus-trained models.

Conclusion: MICL is effective for unseen languages, showcasing potential for ASR improvements without requiring extensive target-language data.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) still covers only a small fraction of the world's languages, mainly due to supervised data scarcity. In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) addresses this problem, but prior work largely focuses on high-resource languages covered during training and text-only settings. This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses. Results show that MICL consistently improves ASR performance, and that cross-lingual transfer learning matches or outperforms corpus-trained language models without using target-language data. Our code is publicly available.

TL;DR: A novel tool using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on word embeddings reveals information flow in natural language expressions, offering insights into LLM representations and model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods analyze LLMs using single-word embeddings, ignoring context. The study addresses this by examining how information flows in natural language expressions.

Method: Applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings to visualize and analyze information flow within LLM layers.

Result: DTI reveals information flow patterns, aids in comparing model structures, and identifies under-utilized layers for pruning. It also detects differences in tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection.

Conclusion: The tool provides deeper insights into LLM representations of natural language, enhancing interpretability beyond isolated word embeddings.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) represent natural language is a central challenge in natural language processing (NLP) research. Many existing methods extract word embeddings from an LLM, visualise the embedding space via point-plots, and compare the relative positions of certain words. However, this approach only considers single words and not whole natural language expressions, thus disregards the context in which a word is used. Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection. Our results show that our model permits novel insights into how LLMs represent actual natural language expressions, extending the comparison of isolated word embeddings and improving the interpretability of NLP models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how LLMs generate persuasive language based on recipient gender, sender intent, and language, revealing gender biases consistent with stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how user instructions influence persuasive language generation in LLMs and whether it varies across target groups, genders, or languages.

Method: A framework evaluating 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompts, assessing persuasive language categories via an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology.

Result: Significant gender differences were found in persuasive language across models, aligning with documented gender-stereotypical linguistic tendencies.

Conclusion: The study highlights biases in LLM-generated persuasive language, emphasizing the need for addressing these issues in model development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for everyday communication tasks, including drafting interpersonal messages intended to influence and persuade. Prior work has shown that LLMs can successfully persuade humans and amplify persuasive language. It is therefore essential to understand how user instructions affect the generation of persuasive language, and to understand whether the generated persuasive language differs, for example, when targeting different groups. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, or output language. We evaluate 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions. We evaluate model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science. Our results reveal significant gender differences in the persuasive language generated across all models. These patterns reflect biases consistent with gender-stereotypical linguistic tendencies documented in social psychology and sociolinguistics.

TL;DR: AutoMonitor-Bench evaluates LLM-based monitors for misbehavior detection, using diverse tasks and failure modes, revealing a trade-off between miss rate and false alarm rate. Fine-tuning models improves performance on unseen misbehaviors, but challenges remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess the reliability of LLM-based misbehavior monitors and identify gaps in their performance across different tasks and failure modes.

Method: Introduces AutoMonitor-Bench with 3,010 annotated samples, evaluates monitors using MR and FAR, and fine-tunes Qwen3-4B-Instruction on a large-scale corpus to test performance on unseen misbehaviors.

Result: Significant variability in monitoring performance and a trade-off between MR and FAR. Fine-tuning improves detection of unseen misbehaviors but highlights scalability challenges.

Conclusion: Reliable misbehavior monitoring remains challenging, emphasizing the need for future work on task-aware design and training strategies.

Abstract: We introduce AutoMonitor-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of LLM-based misbehavior monitors across diverse tasks and failure modes. AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.

*Benedikt Ebing,Lennart Keller,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Romanization improves cross-lingual transfer in multilingual LMs, but its impact on high-resource languages with diverse scripts is unclear. This study pretrains models on romanized and original texts for six languages, finding minimal performance loss for segmental scripts but degradation for morphosyllabic ones. Higher-fidelity romanization helps but doesn’t fully recover performance. No negative interference from increased subword overlap was found, and romanization boosts encoding efficiency for segmental scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine if romanization is beneficial for pretraining general-purpose multilingual language models, especially for high-resource languages, by addressing potential information loss and cross-lingual interference.

Method: Pretrained encoder LMs from scratch on romanized and original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages. Investigated script-specific information loss and cross-lingual interference using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles.

Result: Negligible performance loss for segmental scripts, but degradation for morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese, Japanese). Higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but doesn’t fully recover performance. No evidence of negative interference from increased subword overlap. Romanization improves encoding efficiency for segmental scripts.

Conclusion: Romanization is effective for segmental scripts with minimal trade-offs but problematic for morphosyllabic scripts. It enhances encoding efficiency without causing cross-lingual interference, suggesting selective use in multilingual LM pretraining.

Abstract: Exposing latent lexical overlap, script romanization has emerged as an effective strategy for improving cross-lingual transfer (XLT) in multilingual language models (mLMs). Most prior work, however, focused on setups that favor romanization the most: (1) transfer from high-resource Latin-script to low-resource non-Latin-script languages and/or (2) between genealogically closely related languages with different scripts. It thus remains unclear whether romanization is a good representation choice for pretraining general-purpose mLMs, or, more precisely, if information loss associated with romanization harms performance for high-resource languages. We address this gap by pretraining encoder LMs from scratch on both romanized and original texts for six typologically diverse high-resource languages, investigating two potential sources of degradation: (i) loss of script-specific information and (ii) negative cross-lingual interference from increased vocabulary overlap. Using two romanizers with different fidelity profiles, we observe negligible performance loss for languages with segmental scripts, whereas languages with morphosyllabic scripts (Chinese and Japanese) suffer degradation that higher-fidelity romanization mitigates but cannot fully recover. Importantly, comparing monolingual LMs with their mLM counterpart, we find no evidence that increased subword overlap induces negative interference. We further show that romanization improves encoding efficiency (i.e., fertility) for segmental scripts at a negligible performance cost.

Motivation: To evaluate the tradeoff between fine-tuning and prompt engineering for text simplification tasks using encoder-decoder LLMs.

Method: Comparative study across multiple benchmarks with various evaluation metrics, assessing fine-tuned models versus prompt engineering approaches.

Result: Fine-tuned models perform better in structural simplification, while prompting achieves higher semantic similarity but copies inputs more often. Human evaluators prefer fine-tuned outputs.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning is more effective for text simplification in terms of structural quality and human preference, though prompting excels semantically. Released resources support future work.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable strong text generation, and in general there is a practical tradeoff between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. We introduce Simplify-This, a comparative study evaluating both paradigms for text simplification with encoder-decoder LLMs across multiple benchmarks, using a range of evaluation metrics. Fine-tuned models consistently deliver stronger structural simplification, whereas prompting often attains higher semantic similarity scores yet tends to copy inputs. A human evaluation favors fine-tuned outputs overall. We release code, a cleaned derivative dataset used in our study, checkpoints of fine-tuned models, and prompt templates to facilitate reproducibility and future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnvScaler is an automated framework for creating scalable tool-interaction environments for LLMs, addressing limitations like restricted access, hallucinations, and manual scaling. It uses programmatic synthesis to generate diverse environments and scenarios, improving LLMs' performance in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training LLMs as agents face challenges like restricted access to real systems, hallucinations in simulated environments, and scalability issues with manual sandboxes.

Method: EnvScaler consists of SkelBuilder for creating environment skeletons and ScenGenerator for producing task scenarios and validation functions. It synthesizes environments programmatically.

Result: EnvScaler generated 191 environments and ~7K scenarios, enhancing Qwen3 models' performance in multi-turn, multi-tool tasks across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: EnvScaler effectively addresses scalability and quality issues in tool-interaction environments, significantly boosting LLMs' task-solving abilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are expected to be trained to act as agents in various real-world environments, but this process relies on rich and varied tool-interaction sandboxes. However, access to real systems is often restricted; LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies; and manually built sandboxes are hard to scale. In this paper, we propose EnvScaler, an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis. EnvScaler comprises two components. First, SkelBuilder constructs diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation. Then, ScenGenerator generates multiple task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment. With EnvScaler, we synthesize 191 environments and about 7K scenarios, and apply them to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Qwen3 series models. Results on three benchmarks show that EnvScaler significantly improves LLMs' ability to solve tasks in complex environments involving multi-turn, multi-tool interactions.

We evaluate the usefulness of our trained LLM Journalists in leading conversations with both simulated and human researchers. %compared to the general-purpose ones. Our experiments indicate that LLMs trained using our framework ask more relevant questions that address the societal impact of research, prompting researchers to clarify and elaborate on their findings. In the user study, the majority of participants who interacted with our trained LLM Journalist appreciated it more than interacting with general-purpose LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines political framing biases in LLM-generated summaries across nine models, revealing a tendency toward centrist framing and identifying Grok 4 as the most ideologically expressive, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Llama 3.1 perform best in bias-rating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about political framing in journalism prompted research into LLMs' alignment of bias signals with framing behavior in generated summaries.

Method: The study compared few-shot ideology predictions against LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT labels, generated steered summaries under different prompts, and scored outputs using a fixed ideology evaluator.

Result: Findings show ideological center-collapse in ratings and generated text, with Grok 4 being the most expressive and Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Llama 3.1 excelling in bias-rating.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit systematic centrist framing tendencies, with variability in ideological expressiveness and bias-rating performance across models.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based summarization and text generation are increasingly used for producing and rewriting text, raising concerns about political framing in journalism where subtle wording choices can shape interpretation. Across nine state-of-the-art LLMs, we study political framing by testing whether LLMs' classification-based bias signals align with framing behavior in their generated summaries. We first compare few-shot ideology predictions against LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT labels. We then generate "steered" summaries under FAITHFUL, CENTRIST, LEFT, and RIGHT prompts, and score all outputs using a single fixed ideology evaluator. We find pervasive ideological center-collapse in both article-level ratings and generated text, indicating a systematic tendency toward centrist framing. Among evaluated models, Grok 4 is by far the most ideologically expressive generator, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Llama 3.1 achieve the strongest bias-rating performance among commercial and open-weight models, respectively.

Result: High F1-scores for entity and relation extraction, with improved schema completeness and interoperability compared to baseline methods, validated on the MIMIC-IV Clinical Database Demo.

Conclusion: The proposed NLP-driven pipeline effectively transforms unstructured EHR data into interoperable digital twins, enhancing clinical decision support.

Abstract: Digital twins -- virtual replicas of physical entities -- are gaining traction in healthcare for personalized monitoring, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support. However, generating interoperable patient digital twins from unstructured electronic health records (EHRs) remains challenging due to variability in clinical documentation and lack of standardized mappings. This paper presents a semantic NLP-driven pipeline that transforms free-text EHR notes into FHIR-compliant digital twin representations. The pipeline leverages named entity recognition (NER) to extract clinical concepts, concept normalization to map entities to SNOMED-CT or ICD-10, and relation extraction to capture structured associations between conditions, medications, and observations. Evaluation on MIMIC-IV Clinical Database Demo with validation against MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR reference mappings demonstrates high F1-scores for entity and relation extraction, with improved schema completeness and interoperability compared to baseline methods.

*Sandeep Mishra,Devichand Budagam,Anubhab Mandal,Bishal Santra,Pawan Goyal,Manish Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), leveraging visual and textual context for better predictions in live chats, outperforming text-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance auto-completion by incorporating visual context, improving user intent capture and satisfaction.

Method: Developed MAC using adapted datasets (MMDialog, ImageChat), evaluated VLMs vs. textual models, and introduced Router-Suggest for dynamic model selection.

Result: Router-Suggest achieved 2.3x-10x speedup over VLMs; VLMs excelled in user satisfaction and typing effort reduction.

Conclusion: Multimodal context is crucial for smarter auto-completion, improving user-aware assistants.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal auto-completion is essential for digital assistants, chatbots, design tools, and healthcare consultations, where user inputs rely on shared visual context. We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations. These findings underscore the need for multimodal context in auto-completions, leading to smarter, user-aware assistants.

TL;DR: Integration of curriculum learning into preference optimization algorithms improves multilingual machine translation by mitigating catastrophic forgetting of easy examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of large language models in zero-shot multilingual machine translation by exploring the impact of data sample order during training.

Method: Introduced a curriculum learning strategy with restarts (CLewR), which reiterates easy-to-hard curriculum multiple times during training.

Result: Consistent improvements in translation performance across various model families (Gemma2, Qwen2.5, Llama3.1) and preference optimization techniques.

Conclusion: CLewR effectively boosts multilingual machine translation by addressing the issue of catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated competitive performance in zero-shot multilingual machine translation (MT). Some follow-up works further improved MT performance via preference optimization, but they leave a key aspect largely underexplored: the order in which data samples are given during training. We address this topic by integrating curriculum learning into various state-of-the-art preference optimization algorithms to boost MT performance. We introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy with restarts (CLewR), which reiterates easy-to-hard curriculum multiple times during training to effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of easy examples. We demonstrate consistent gains across several model families (Gemma2, Qwen2.5, Llama3.1) and preference optimization techniques. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/alexandra-dragomir/CLewR.

*Jonathan Downie,Joss Moorkens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores automated methods for measuring interpreting quality but concludes they fail to account for communicative context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing demand for efficient quality measurement in interpreting technologies.

Method: Examination of recently-proposed automated quality measurement methods.

Result: Current automatic metrics lack consideration of communicative context.

Conclusion: Automated metrics alone are insufficient for assessing interpreting quality; context is crucial.

Abstract: With the growth of interpreting technologies, from remote interpreting and Computer-Aided Interpreting to automated speech translation and interpreting avatars, there is now a high demand for ways to quickly and efficiently measure the quality of any interpreting delivered. A range of approaches to fulfil the need for quick and efficient quality measurement have been proposed, each involving some measure of automation. This article examines these recently-proposed quality measurement methods and will discuss their suitability for measuring the quality of authentic interpreting practice, whether delivered by humans or machines, concluding that automatic metrics as currently proposed cannot take into account the communicative context and thus are not viable measures of the quality of any interpreting provision when used on their own. Across all attempts to measure or even categorise quality in Interpreting Studies, the contexts in which interpreting takes place have become fundamental to the final analysis.

*Maxime Dassen,Rebecca Kotula,Kenton Murray,Andrew Yates,Dawn Lawrie,Efsun Kayi,James Mayfield,Kevin Duh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FACTUM introduces mechanistic scores to measure citation trustworthiness, revealing scale-dependent signatures of correct citations and outperforming baselines by up to 37.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address citation hallucinations in RAG models by understanding the dynamic interplay of internal mechanisms rather than attributing them solely to parametric knowledge reliance.

Method: Develops FACTUM, a framework with four mechanistic scores analyzing attention and FFN pathways and their alignment.

Result: Identifies evolving signatures of correct citations (e.g., pathway alignment varies with model scale) and achieves a 37.5% improvement in AUC.

Conclusion: Citation hallucination is a complex, scale-dependent phenomenon, and FACTUM offers a nuanced approach for more reliable RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models are critically undermined by citation hallucinations, a deceptive failure where a model confidently cites a source that fails to support its claim. Existing work often attributes hallucination to a simple over-reliance on the model's parametric knowledge. We challenge this view and introduce FACTUM (Framework for Attesting Citation Trustworthiness via Underlying Mechanisms), a framework of four mechanistic scores measuring the distinct contributions of a model's attention and FFN pathways, and the alignment between them. Our analysis reveals two consistent signatures of correct citation: a significantly stronger contribution from the model's parametric knowledge and greater use of the attention sink for information synthesis. Crucially, we find the signature of a correct citation is not static but evolves with model scale. For example, the signature of a correct citation for the Llama-3.2-3B model is marked by higher pathway alignment, whereas for the Llama-3.1-8B model, it is characterized by lower alignment, where pathways contribute more distinct, orthogonal information. By capturing this complex, evolving signature, FACTUM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 37.5% in AUC. Our findings reframe citation hallucination as a complex, scale-dependent interplay between internal mechanisms, paving the way for more nuanced and reliable RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate catastrophic forgetting in SLMs adapted from LLMs, especially for low-resource languages, by employing continual learning techniques.

Method: Uses POS-based code-switching and a replay adapter strategy to prevent catastrophic forgetting during SLM training.

Result: Successful application in vision-language tasks like visual question answering and language modeling.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting, enhancing SLM performance in multilingual settings.

Abstract: Modelling a language model for a multi-lingual scenario includes several potential challenges, among which catastrophic forgetting is the major challenge. For example, small language models (SLM) built for low-resource languages by adapting large language models (LLMs) pose the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. This work proposes to employ a continual learning strategy using parts-of-speech (POS)-based code-switching along with a replay adapter strategy to mitigate the identified gap of catastrophic forgetting while training SLM from LLM. Experiments conducted on vision language tasks such as visual question answering and language modelling task exhibits the success of the proposed architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iReasoner is a self-evolving framework that enhances large multimodal models' reasoning by explicitly rewarding intermediate chain-of-thought steps, improving performance without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-evolving frameworks focus on rewarding final outcomes, neglecting the importance of intermediate reasoning steps in visually grounded decision making.

Method: iReasoner uses a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, augmenting outcome-level rewards with trajectory-aware signals for intermediate reasoning.

Result: Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner improves performance by up to 2.1 points across multimodal reasoning benchmarks in unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: iReasoner advances reasoning-aware self-improvement for LMMs in unsupervised environments, highlighting the potential of trajectory-aware learning.

Abstract: Recent work shows that large multimodal models (LMMs) can self-improve from unlabeled data via self-play and intrinsic feedback. Yet existing self-evolving frameworks mainly reward final outcomes, leaving intermediate reasoning weakly constrained despite its importance for visually grounded decision making. We propose iReasoner, a self-evolving framework that improves an LMM's implicit reasoning by explicitly eliciting chain-of-thought (CoT) and rewarding its internal agreement. In a Proposer--Solver loop over unlabeled images, iReasoner augments outcome-level intrinsic rewards with a trajectory-aware signal defined over intermediate reasoning steps, providing learning signals that distinguish reasoning paths leading to the same answer without ground-truth labels or external judges. Starting from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, iReasoner yields up to $+2.1$ points across diverse multimodal reasoning benchmarks under fully unsupervised post-training. We hope this work serves as a starting point for reasoning-aware self-improvement in LMMs in purely unsupervised settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates gender bias in LLMs' responses to a family law scenario, revealing potential risks for laypeople relying on them for legal advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs exhibit gender bias in legal guidance, given laypeople's increasing reliance on them for self-help.

Method: Evaluates four LLMs using gendered and neutral versions of a divorce scenario, testing nine legally relevant factors for influence on outcomes.

Result: Preliminary results show differences across models and gender-dependent patterns in outcomes.

Conclusion: Highlights risks of laypeople relying on LLMs and calls for better evaluation of model behavior in legal contexts.

Abstract: Access to justice remains limited for many people, leading laypersons to increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal self-help. Laypeople use these tools intuitively, which may lead them to form expectations based on incomplete, incorrect, or biased outputs. This study examines whether leading LLMs exhibit gender bias in their responses to a realistic family law scenario. We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts. We present exploratory and descriptive evidence intended to identify systematic asymmetries rather than to establish causal effects.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how preference-tuning impacts generalization under domain shift and evaluates adaptation strategies to mitigate degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the degradation in performance and helpfulness caused by preference-tuning outside the training domain.

Method: Comparative study of five alignment objectives and adaptation strategies (e.g., target-domain fine-tuning, pseudo-labeling) across summarization and question-answering tasks.

Result: Pseudo-labeling-based adaptation strategies significantly reduce domain-shift degradation, with systematic differences observed among alignment objectives.

Conclusion: Adaptation strategies, especially pseudo-labeling, effectively mitigate domain-shift issues in preference-tuning, improving generalization.

Abstract: Preference tuning aligns pretrained language models to human judgments of quality, helpfulness, or safety by optimizing over explicit preference signals rather than likelihood alone. Prior work has shown that preference-tuning degrades performance and reduces helpfulness when evaluated outside the training domain. However, the extent to which adaptation strategies mitigate this domain shift remains unexplored. We address this challenge by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of alignment generalization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. Our findings reveal systematic differences in generalization across alignment objectives under domain shift. We show that adaptation strategies based on pseudo-labeling can substantially reduce domain-shift degradation

*Zihang Tian,Rui Li,Jingsen Zhang,Xiaohe Bo,Wei Huo,Xu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAPS is a hierarchical LLM routing framework that jointly searches architectures and parameters for better task performance, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routing approaches focus on architectures but neglect parameter settings, which impact performance.

Method: HAPS uses a high-level router for architectures and a low-level router for parameters, with shared parameters via a parameter generation network. Training involves a reward-augmented objective.

Result: HAPS outperforms baselines on two benchmarks.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing architectures and parameters improves LLM routing performance, as demonstrated by HAPS.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routing aims to exploit the specialized strengths of different LLMs for diverse tasks. However, existing approaches typically focus on selecting LLM architectures while overlooking parameter settings, which are critical for task performance. In this paper, we introduce HAPS, a hierarchical LLM routing framework that jointly searches over model architectures and parameters. Specifically, we use a high-level router to select among candidate LLM architectures, and then search for the optimal parameters for the selected architectures based on a low-level router. We design a parameter generation network to share parameters between the two routers to mutually enhance their capabilities. In the training process, we design a reward-augmented objective to effectively optimize our framework. Experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that HAPS consistently outperforms strong routing baselines. We have released our code at https://github.com/zihangtian/HAPS.

TL;DR: Pantagruel models are self-supervised encoders for French text and speech, outperforming baselines like CamemBERT and FlauBERT across multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified model for French text and speech representation learning that captures linguistic and acoustic regularities effectively.

Method: Pre-training separate models on large-scale French corpora (text and speech) using feature-space self-supervised objectives, avoiding modality-specific targets.

Result: Pantagruel achieves competitive or superior performance on French benchmarks (FLUE, LeBenchmark) compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: Pantagruel is effective for French multimodal representation learning and serves as a robust foundation for speech-text understanding.

Abstract: We release Pantagruel models, a new family of self-supervised encoder models for French text and speech. Instead of predicting modality-tailored targets such as textual tokens or speech units, Pantagruel learns contextualized target representations in the feature space, allowing modality-specific encoders to capture linguistic and acoustic regularities more effectively. Separate models are pre-trained on large-scale French corpora, including Wikipedia, OSCAR and CroissantLLM for text, together with MultilingualLibriSpeech, LeBenchmark, and INA-100k for speech. INA-100k is a newly introduced 100,000-hour corpus of French audio derived from the archives of the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel (INA), the national repository of French radio and television broadcasts, providing highly diverse audio data. We evaluate Pantagruel across a broad range of downstream tasks spanning both modalities, including those from the standard French benchmarks such as FLUE or LeBenchmark. Across these tasks, Pantagruel models show competitive or superior performance compared to strong French baselines such as CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and LeBenchmark2.0, while maintaining a shared architecture that can seamlessly handle either speech or text inputs. These results confirm the effectiveness of feature-space self-supervised objectives for French representation learning and highlight Pantagruel as a robust foundation for multimodal speech-text understanding.

TL;DR: The paper explores why LLMs struggle with Long CoT reasoning and identifies stable molecular-like structures as key. It introduces Mole-Syn for synthesizing effective Long CoT structures, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often fail at Long CoT reasoning, prompting investigation into learnable structures and interactions.

Method: The study analyzes distilled trajectories to identify three interaction types and introduces Mole-Syn, a method to synthesize effective Long CoT structures.

Result: Long CoT fine-tuning reveals stable structures, and Mole-Syn enhances performance and RL stability in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effective Long CoT learning relies on specific stable structures, and Mole-Syn successfully guides their synthesis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to learn effective long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) reasoning from human or non-Long-CoT LLMs imitation. To understand this, we propose that effective and learnable Long CoT trajectories feature stable molecular-like structures in unified view, which are formed by three interaction types: Deep-Reasoning (covalent-like), Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like), and Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like). Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation. We introduce Effective Semantic Isomers and show that only bonds promoting fast entropy convergence support stable Long CoT learning, while structural competition impairs training. Drawing on these findings, we present Mole-Syn, a distribution-transfer-graph method that guides synthesis of effective Long CoT structures, boosting performance and RL stability across benchmarks.

TL;DR: Prompt caching significantly reduces costs (45-80%) and improves latency (13-31%) for multi-turn LLM agent tasks, with strategic caching outperforming naive full-context caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the underexplored benefits of prompt caching for agentic workloads in LLMs, quantifying cost savings and comparing caching strategies.

Method: Evaluate three caching strategies across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google using DeepResearchBench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark with real-world tool calls.

Result: Strategic caching (e.g., excluding dynamic tool results) reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves TTFT by 13-31%, outperforming full-context caching.

Conclusion: Strategic prompt caching is highly effective for agentic tasks, with provider-specific nuances; practical implementation guidance is provided.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have enabled complex multi-turn agentic tasks requiring extensive tool calling, where conversations can span dozens of API calls with increasingly large context windows. However, although major LLM providers offer prompt caching to reduce cost and latency, its benefits for agentic workloads remain underexplored in the research literature. To our knowledge, no prior work quantifies these cost savings or compares caching strategies for multi-turn agentic tasks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of prompt caching across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) and compare three caching strategies, including full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. We evaluate on DeepResearchBench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute real-world web search tool calls to answer complex research questions, measuring both API cost and time to first token (TTFT) across over 500 agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts. Our results demonstrate that prompt caching reduces API costs by 45-80% and improves time to first token by 13-31% across providers. We find that strategic prompt cache block control, such as placing dynamic content at the end of the system prompt, avoiding dynamic traditional function calling, and excluding dynamic tool results, provides more consistent benefits than naive full-context caching, which can paradoxically increase latency. Our analysis reveals nuanced variations in caching behavior across providers, and we provide practical guidance for implementing prompt caching in production agentic systems.

TL;DR: CaRR and C-GRPO introduce fine-grained rewards and optimized training for LLM-based deep search agents, improving reasoning comprehensiveness and factual grounding while reducing shortcut exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for deep search agents rely on binary rewards, which overlook reasoning quality and lead to undesirable behaviors like hallucinations.

Method: CaRR decomposes questions into verifiable rubrics, requiring agents to cite evidence and build complete chains. C-GRPO combines CaRR with outcome rewards for training.

Result: C-GRPO outperforms standard RL baselines, reduces shortcuts, and enhances reasoning in deep search benchmarks.

Conclusion: CaRR and C-GRPO effectively improve agent robustness and generalization in open-ended research tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing LLM-based deep search agents. However, existing approaches primarily rely on binary outcome rewards, which fail to capture the comprehensiveness and factuality of agents' reasoning process, and often lead to undesirable behaviors such as shortcut exploitation and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Citation-aware Rubric Rewards (CaRR)}, a fine-grained reward framework for deep search agents that emphasizes reasoning comprehensiveness, factual grounding, and evidence connectivity. CaRR decomposes complex questions into verifiable single-hop rubrics and requires agents to satisfy these rubrics by explicitly identifying hidden entities, supporting them with correct citations, and constructing complete evidence chains that link to the predicted answer. We further introduce \textbf{Citation-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)}, which combines CaRR and outcome rewards for training robust deep search agents. Experiments show that C-GRPO consistently outperforms standard outcome-based RL baselines across multiple deep search benchmarks. Our analysis also validates that C-GRPO effectively discourages shortcut exploitation, promotes comprehensive, evidence-grounded reasoning, and exhibits strong generalization to open-ended deep research tasks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/CaRR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaFuse is an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically adjusts fusion granularity during generation, outperforming fixed-granularity methods by 6.88% on average across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble approaches lack flexibility for mid-generation adaptation and fail to handle varying task characteristics.

Method: AdaFuse uses uncertainty-based criteria to decide ensembling steps and employs diversity-aware scaling for uncertain states, aligning words as building blocks.

Result: AdaFuse outperforms strong baselines, achieving a 6.88% relative improvement in tasks like question answering, reasoning, and translation.

Conclusion: AdaFuse effectively combines adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, enhancing performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.

TL;DR: MoEBlaze is a memory-efficient MoE training framework addressing memory bottlenecks in large-scale MoE architectures, achieving 4x speedups and 50% memory savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The "memory wall" bottleneck in MoE architectures limits batch size, sequence length, and performance due to sparse compute and activation memory overheads.

Method: MoEBlaze uses co-designed system approaches: optimized token dispatch/training data structures and kernels with smart activation checkpointing.

Result: Achieves over 4x speedups and 50% memory savings compared to existing MoE frameworks.

Conclusion: MoEBlaze effectively mitigates memory pressure and improves performance in MoE training.

Abstract: The pervasive "memory wall" bottleneck is significantly amplified in modern large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. MoE's inherent architectural sparsity leads to sparse arithmetic compute and also introduces substantial activation memory overheads -- driven by large token routing buffers and the need to materialize and buffer intermediate tensors. This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance. We demonstrate that MoEBlaze can achieve over 4x speedups and over 50% memory savings compared to existing MoE frameworks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dialogue models lack temporal awareness and often use inefficient reasoning traces.

Method: TIME uses a behavioral alignment framework with temporal tags and short reasoning blocks, trained via a four-phase curriculum.

Result: TIME improves temporal reasoning scores and significantly reduces reasoning tokens across model scales.

Conclusion: TIME effectively enhances dialogue models' temporal intelligence and efficiency.

Abstract: Reasoning oriented large language models often expose explicit "thinking" as long, turn-global traces at the start of every response, either always on or toggled externally at inference time. While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude. Our training data and code are available at https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIME and TIMEBench is available at https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIMEBench

Conclusion: Topological structure can enhance gradient-based optimization without compromising interpretability or computational efficiency.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic reasoning systems face fundamental challenges in maintaining semantic coherence while satisfying physical and logical constraints. Building upon our previous work on Ontology Neural Networks, we present an enhanced framework that integrates topological conditioning with gradient stabilization mechanisms. The approach employs Forman-Ricci curvature to capture graph topology, Deep Delta Learning for stable rank-one perturbations during constraint projection, and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy for parameter optimization. Experimental evaluation across multiple problem sizes demonstrates that the method achieves mean energy reduction to 1.15 compared to baseline values of 11.68, with 95 percent success rate in constraint satisfaction tasks. The framework exhibits seed-independent convergence and graceful scaling behavior up to twenty-node problems, suggesting that topological structure can inform gradient-based optimization without sacrificing interpretability or computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EquFL is a server-side debiasing method for federated learning that reduces bias without modifying client protocols, ensuring fairness while maintaining model convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness challenges in federated learning, EquFL aims to mitigate bias without altering client training protocols or requiring inflexible aggregation strategies.

Method: EquFL enables the server to generate a calibrated update from client model updates, which is then integrated with aggregated updates to reduce bias in the global model.

Result: EquFL theoretically converges to FedAvg's optimal global model and empirically reduces fairness loss, proving its effectiveness in bias mitigation.

Conclusion: EquFL provides a flexible and effective solution for fairness-aware debiasing in federated learning, maintaining convergence and reducing bias.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative distributed learning paradigm, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model under the coordination of a central server without sharing their raw training data. While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness.

### [115] [GlyRAG: Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Blood Glucose Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05353)
*Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GlyRAG, a context-aware framework using LLMs for blood glucose forecasting, outperforms existing methods by leveraging semantic understanding from CGM traces without extra sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models treat glucose readings as numerical sequences, missing context or requiring additional sensors, which limits scalability.

Method: GlyRAG uses an LLM to generate clinical summaries, fuses them with glucose data via a multimodal transformer, and retrieves similar historical cases for forecasting.

Result: GlyRAG reduces RMSE by up to 39% and improves dysglycemic event prediction by 51%, placing 85% of predictions in safe zones.

Conclusion: LLM-based contextualization enhances glucose forecasting accuracy and reliability, supporting future diabetes management tools without extra sensors.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of blood glucose from CGM is essential for preventing dysglycemic events, thus enabling proactive diabetes management. However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts. These results indicate that LLM-based contextualization and retrieval over CGM traces can enhance the accuracy and clinical reliability of long-horizon glucose forecasting without the need for extra sensors, thus supporting future agentic decision-support tools for diabetes management.

TL;DR: HINT introduces a hierarchical KD framework for MARL, addressing bottlenecks like OOD reasoning and observation mismatches, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation in MARL faces challenges like synthesizing teaching policies, OOD reasoning, and observation mismatches.

Method: HINT uses hierarchical RL for scalable teaching, pseudo off-policy RL for OOD adaptation, and performance-based filtering.

Result: HINT achieves improvements of 60% to 165% in success rate across benchmarks.

Conclusion: HINT effectively addresses MARL distillation bottlenecks and outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has the potential to accelerate MARL by employing a centralized teacher for decentralized students but faces key bottlenecks. Specifically, there are (1) challenges in synthesizing high-performing teaching policies in complex domains, (2) difficulties when teachers must reason in out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and (3) mismatches between the decentralized students' and the centralized teacher's observation spaces. To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation. HINT also applies performance-based filtering to retain only outcome-relevant guidance, reducing observation mismatches. We evaluate HINT on challenging cooperative domains (e.g., FireCommander for resource allocation, MARINE for tactical combat). Across these benchmarks, HINT outperforms baselines, achieving improvements of 60% to 165% in success rate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian optimization framework for kernel selection in Gaussian Process regression, using kernel-of-kernels geometry and MDS embedding to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting an appropriate covariance kernel is critical yet challenging in GP regression. Current methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Uses Bayesian optimization with kernel-of-kernels geometry and MDS embedding to map kernel space smoothly.

Result: Achieves superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a reusable probabilistic geometry for kernel search, enhancing GP modeling and deep kernel learning.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a powerful nonparametric Bayesian framework, but its performance depends critically on the choice of covariance kernel. Selecting an appropriate kernel is therefore central to model quality, yet remains one of the most challenging and computationally expensive steps in probabilistic modeling. We present a Bayesian optimization framework built on kernel-of-kernels geometry, using expected divergence-based distances between GP priors to explore kernel space efficiently. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search. This framework establishes a reusable probabilistic geometry for kernel search, with direct relevance to GP modeling and deep kernel learning.

### [118] [Inverting Non-Injective Functions with Twin Neural Network Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05378)
*Sebastian J. Wetzel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deterministic framework using twin neural network regression and k-nearest neighbor search to invert non-injective functions, demonstrated on toy problems and robot arm control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-injective functions lack invertibility, but local restrictions or preferred solutions can enable inversion. The paper aims to address this challenge.

Method: Twin neural network regression is trained to adjust known inputs for new target outputs. Combined with k-nearest neighbor search, it forms a deterministic inversion framework.

Result: The method successfully inverts non-injective functions in both data-defined and formula-based scenarios, including toy problems and robot arm control.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles the inversion of non-injective functions, proving useful in practical applications like robotics.

Abstract: Non-injective functions are not invertible. However, non-injective functions can be restricted to sub-domains on which they are locally injective and surjective and thus invertible if the dimensionality between input and output spaces are the same. Further, even if the dimensionalities do not match it is often possible to choose a preferred solution from many possible solutions. Twin neural network regression is naturally capable of incorporating these properties to invert non-injective functions. Twin neural network regression is trained to predict adjustments to well known input variables $\mathbf{x}^{\text{anchor}}$ to obtain an estimate for an unknown $\mathbf{x}^{\text{new}}$ under a change of the target variable from $\mathbf{y}^{\text{anchor}}$ to $\mathbf{y}^{\text{new}}$. In combination with k-nearest neighbor search, I propose a deterministic framework that finds input parameters to a given target variable of non-injective functions. The method is demonstrated by inverting non-injective functions describing toy problems and robot arm control that are a) defined by data or b) known as mathematical formula.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a taxonomy for classifying experts in imitation learning (IL) for combinatorial optimisation, focusing on uncertainty handling, optimality, and interaction modes. It proposes a generalised DAgger algorithm and validates its framework on a physician-to-patient assignment problem, showing stochastic experts outperform others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unifying framework to characterise experts in IL for combinatorial optimisation motivates this study, aiming to systematically classify experts and improve learning performance.

Method: The paper classifies experts along three dimensions: treatment of uncertainty, level of optimality, and interaction mode with the learner. It proposes a generalised DAgger algorithm supporting multiple expert queries and flexible interaction strategies.

Result: Experiments on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem show policies from stochastic experts outperform deterministic or full-information ones, and interactive learning improves solutions using fewer demonstrations.

Conclusion: The introduced taxonomy and framework enhance IL in combinatorial optimisation, demonstrating the superiority of stochastic experts and the effectiveness of aggregated deterministic experts when stochastic optimisation is challenging.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) provides a data-driven framework for approximating policies for large-scale combinatorial optimisation problems formulated as sequential decision problems (SDPs), where exact solution methods are computationally intractable. A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.
  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.
  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations. Aggregated deterministic experts provide an effective alternative when stochastic optimisation becomes computationally challenging.

*Namrata Banerji,Tanya Berger-Wolf*

TL;DR: Proposes a dynamic edge-biased spatiotemporal model for accurate multistep forecasting of node attributes on dynamic graphs, outperforming baselines on RMSE and MAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitation of existing spatiotemporal graph neural networks that assume static adjacency matrices, focusing on applications like financial and biological networks.

Method: Uses a transformer-based model to inject dynamic adjacency matrices as adaptable attention biases, with pretraining and scheduled sampling to handle evolving graphs.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong baselines on RMSE and MAE, accommodating dynamic graphs across multi-system settings.

Conclusion: The model effectively handles dynamic graphs and improves forecasting accuracy for node attributes, applicable to diverse real-world systems.

Abstract: Accurate multistep forecasting of node-level attributes on dynamic graphs is critical for applications ranging from financial trust networks to biological networks. Existing spatiotemporal graph neural networks typically assume a static adjacency matrix. In this work, we propose an end-to-end dynamic edge-biased spatiotemporal model that ingests a multi-dimensional timeseries of node attributes and a timeseries of adjacency matrices, to predict multiple future steps of node attributes. At each time step, our transformer-based model injects the given adjacency as an adaptable attention bias, allowing the model to focus on relevant neighbors as the graph evolves. We further deploy a masked node-time pretraining objective that primes the encoder to reconstruct missing features, and train with scheduled sampling and a horizon-weighted loss to mitigate compounding error over long horizons. Unlike prior work, our model accommodates dynamic graphs that vary across input samples, enabling forecasting in multi-system settings such as brain networks across different subjects, financial systems in different contexts, or evolving social systems. Empirical results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

*Yiqun T Chen,Sizhu Lu,Sijia Li,Moran Guo,Shengyi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes two approaches—measurement-error correction and surrogate-outcome methods—for improving LLM-based evaluation of generative AI outputs, unifying them under semiparametric efficiency theory and comparing their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are imperfect evaluators ('LLM-as-a-judge') with systematic errors, prompting the need for methods to correct bias and improve accuracy.

Method: The study unifies measurement-error correction and prediction-powered inference (PPI) estimators using semiparametric efficiency theory and characterizes conditions for PPI's superior asymptotic variance.

Result: Theoretical results are verified via simulations, and real-data examples demonstrate the methods' effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified framework for debiasing LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, with tools and comparisons available on GitHub.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic evaluators of generative AI outputs, a paradigm often referred to as "LLM-as-a-judge." In practice, LLM judges are imperfect predictions for the underlying truth and can exhibit systematic, non-random errors. Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections. We verify our theoretical results in simulations and demonstrate the methods on real-data examples. We provide an implementation of the benchmarked methods and comparison utilities at https://github.com/yiqunchen/debias-llm-as-a-judge.

TL;DR: A VAE-based DSI framework predicts pressure, stress, strain, and fault slip tendency in CO₂ storage projects, bypassing the need for posterior geomodels by using prior simulations and observed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate assessment of fault slip potential is crucial for subsurface operations, but conventional model-based methods face challenges in coupled flow-geomechanics problems.

Method: A VAE with convolutional LSTM layers is trained on prior simulation results to represent key fields using latent variables, applied with DSI for posterior predictions using observed data.

Result: The DSI-VAE framework provides accurate predictions for pressure, strain, stress, and fault slip tendency, reducing uncertainty in geomechanical and fault parameters.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bypasses the need for posterior geomodels, offering accurate and efficient predictions for subsurface operations.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the potential for fault slip is essential in many subsurface operations. Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults. In this work, we implement a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based data-space inversion (DSI) framework to predict pressure, stress and strain fields, and fault slip tendency, in CO${_2}$ storage projects. The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables. The VAE parameterization is used with DSI for posterior predictions, with monitoring wells providing observed pressure and strain data. Posterior results for synthetic true models demonstrate that the DSI-VAE framework gives accurate predictions for pressure, strain, and stress fields and for fault slip tendency. The framework is also shown to reduce uncertainty in key geomechanical and fault parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality training data limits progress in text-to-SQL systems, as manual creation is expensive and existing synthetic methods lack reliability or scalability.

Method: RingSQL uses schema-independent query templates paired with LLM-based paraphrasing to generate natural language questions, ensuring SQL correctness and linguistic variety.

Result: Models trained on RingSQL-generated data show an average accuracy gain of +2.3% across six benchmarks compared to other synthetic data methods.

Conclusion: RingSQL effectively balances correctness and scalability in data generation, improving text-to-SQL model performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-SQL systems have been driven by larger models and improved datasets, yet progress is still limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data. Manual data creation is expensive, and existing synthetic methods trade off reliability and scalability. Template-based approaches ensure correct SQL but require schema-specific templates, while LLM-based generation scales easily but lacks quality and correctness guarantees. We introduce RingSQL, a hybrid data generation framework that combines schema-independent query templates with LLM-based paraphrasing of natural language questions. This approach preserves SQL correctness across diverse schemas while providing broad linguistic variety. In our experiments, we find that models trained using data produced by RingSQL achieve an average gain in accuracy of +2.3% across six text-to-SQL benchmarks when compared to models trained on other synthetic data. We make our code available at https://github.com/nu-c3lab/RingSQL.

TL;DR: ALVGL enhances differentiable causal discovery by learning a sparse and low-rank precision matrix decomposition, constructing a super-structure to guide optimization, and improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing differentiable causal discovery methods face challenges with high-dimensional data and latent confounders due to vast search spaces and complex constraints.

Method: ALVGL uses sparse and low-rank decomposition of the precision matrix, optimized via ADMM, to construct a super-structure for guiding causal discovery.

Result: ALVGL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and optimization efficiency across Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, including cases with unmeasured confounders.

Conclusion: ALVGL is a reliable and effective enhancement for differentiable causal discovery, addressing key challenges in efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, differentiable causal discovery has emerged as a promising approach to improve the accuracy and efficiency of existing methods. However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.
  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.
  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ALVGL not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly improves optimization efficiency, making it a reliable and effective solution for differentiable causal discovery.

TL;DR: MaxCode addresses LLMs' challenges in code optimization by integrating inference-time search algorithms and natural language feedback, improving performance benchmarks significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with writing optimized code due to its complexity and interpreting performance metrics beyond correctness.

Method: MaxCode uses a max-reward RL framework with modular observation/action functions, natural language critiques, and generative reward-to-go models for exploration.

Result: MaxCode achieves 20.3% and 10.1% improvements in speedup value and ranking on CUDA and C++ benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances LLM-driven code optimization through iterative refinement and richer feedback.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general coding tasks but encounter two key challenges when optimizing code: (i) the complexity of writing optimized code (such as performant CUDA kernels and competition-level CPU code) requires expertise in systems, algorithms and specific languages and (ii) requires interpretation of performance metrics like timing and device utilization beyond binary correctness. In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far. Together, these provide richer input to the code proposal function. To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions. Testing on the KernelBench (CUDA) and PIE (C++) optimization benchmarks shows that MaxCode improves optimized code performance compared to baselines, achieving 20.3% and 10.1% relative improvements in absolute speedup value and relative speedup ranking, respectively.

*Feihu Jin,Ying Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hi-ZFO is a hybrid optimization framework combining zeroth- and first-order methods to improve LLM fine-tuning by balancing precision and exploratory behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard first-order optimization leads to poor generalization, while zeroth-order methods are slow and noisy, especially in generative tasks. A hybrid approach is needed.

Method: Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model, applying first-order updates to critical layers and zeroth-order optimization to others, introducing beneficial stochasticity.

Result: Hi-ZFO outperforms pure methods in generative, mathematical, and code reasoning tasks, reducing training time.

Conclusion: Hierarchical hybrid optimization (Hi-ZFO) effectively balances precision and exploration for LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using standard first-order (FO) optimization often drives training toward sharp, poorly generalizing minima. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) methods offer stronger exploratory behavior without relying on explicit gradients, yet suffer from slow convergence. More critically, our analysis reveals that in generative tasks, the vast output and search space significantly amplify estimation variance, rendering ZO methods both noisy and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{Z}eroth- and \textbf{F}irst-\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones. Notably, ZO in Hi-ZFO is not merely a memory-saving surrogate; it is intentionally introduced as a source of "beneficial stochasticity" to help the model escape the local minima where pure FO optimization tends to stagnate. Validated across diverse generative, mathematical, and code reasoning tasks, Hi-ZFO consistently achieves superior performance while significantly reducing the training time. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical hybrid optimization for LLM fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and hallucinations caused by unnecessary searches in search-augmented LLMs.

Method: Systematic evaluation across query types, model categories, retrieval conditions, and multi-turn conversations. Introduces Tokens Per Correctness (TPC) as a metric.

Result: Search improves accuracy for answerable queries but harms abstention for unanswerable ones. Over-searching worsens with noisy retrieval and multi-turn conversations. Negative evidence improves abstention.

Conclusion: Mitigation strategies are proposed at query and retrieval levels, and OverSearchQA is released for further research.

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external retrieval. However, they often over-search -- unnecessarily invoking search tool even when it does not improve response quality, which leads to computational inefficiency and hallucinations by incorporating irrelevant context. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of over-searching across multiple dimensions, including query types, model categories, retrieval conditions, and multi-turn conversations. Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention. To quantify over-searching, we introduce Tokens Per Correctness (TPC), an evaluation metric that captures the performance-cost trade-off for search-augmented LLMs. Lastly, we investigate mitigation approaches at both the query and retrieval levels and release the OverSearchQA to foster continued research into efficient search-augmented LLMs.

### [128] [Toward an Integrated Cross-Urban Accident Prevention System: A Multi-Task Spatial-Temporal Learning Framework for Urban Safety Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05521)
*Jiayu Fang,Zhiqi Shao,Haoning Xi,Boris Choy,Junbin Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed MLA-STNet improves cross-city accident prediction by integrating spatial-temporal modules, achieving better accuracy and robustness compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneity, inconsistent reporting, and noisy urban accident data hinder unified accident prevention systems.

Method: MLA-STNet combines STG-MA (for stability) and STS-MA (for cross-city training) in a multi-task learning framework.

Result: Outperforms baselines with 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, even under noisy inputs.

Conclusion: MLA-STNet unifies heterogeneous data into a scalable, robust system for coordinated urban safety management.

Abstract: The development of a cross-city accident prevention system is particularly challenging due to the heterogeneity, inconsistent reporting, and inherently clustered, sparse, cyclical, and noisy nature of urban accident data. These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise. These results demonstrate that MLA-STNet effectively unifies heterogeneous urban datasets within a scalable, robust, and interpretable Cross-City Accident Prevention System, paving the way for coordinated and data-driven urban safety management.

*Rui An,Haohao Qu,Wenqi Fan,Xuequn Shang,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone, improves MTS analysis by addressing vanilla Mamba's limitations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers dominate MTS analysis but suffer from high computational costs. Mamba offers linear-time complexity but lacks cross-variate modeling and struggles with disentangling intra- and inter-series dynamics.

Method: DeMa introduces intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interaction decomposition, a Mamba-SSD module for long-range dynamics, and a Mamba-DALA module for cross-variate dependencies.

Result: DeMa excels in long-/short-term forecasting, data imputation, anomaly detection, and series classification, outperforming others with high efficiency.

Conclusion: DeMa effectively addresses Mamba's limitations, enhancing MTS analysis scalability and performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient multivariate time series (MTS) analysis is increasingly critical for a wide range of intelligent applications. Within this realm, Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture due to their strong ability to capture pairwise dependencies. However, Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in long-term and large-scale MTS modeling. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising linear-time alternative with high expressiveness. Nevertheless, directly applying vanilla Mamba to MTS remains suboptimal due to three key limitations: (i) the lack of explicit cross-variate modeling, (ii) difficulty in disentangling the entangled intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions, and (iii) insufficient modeling of latent time-lag interaction effects. These issues constrain its effectiveness across diverse MTS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone. DeMa preserves Mamba's linear-complexity advantage while substantially improving its suitability for MTS settings. Specifically, DeMa introduces three key innovations: (i) it decomposes the MTS into intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions; (ii) it develops a temporal path with a Mamba-SSD module to capture long-range dynamics within each individual series, enabling series-independent, parallel computation; and (iii) it designs a variate path with a Mamba-DALA module that integrates delay-aware linear attention to model cross-variate dependencies. Extensive experiments on five representative tasks, long- and short-term forecasting, data imputation, anomaly detection, and series classification, demonstrate that DeMa achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering remarkable computational efficiency.

*Wei Zhou,Hong Huang,Ruize Shi,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOPE addresses the Linear Projection Bottleneck in HGNNs by introducing prototype-based routing and expert orthogonalization, improving performance with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HGNNs suffer from a Linear Projection Bottleneck, where a single shared linear head fails to handle contextual diversity and long-tail shifts in heterogeneous graphs.

Method: The proposed HOPE framework replaces the standard prediction head with prototype-based routing to assign instances to experts by similarity and includes expert orthogonalization to prevent collapse.

Result: Experiments on four real datasets demonstrate consistent improvements across state-of-the-art HGNN backbones with minimal additional cost.

Conclusion: HOPE effectively mitigates the limitations of linear projection in HGNNs, enhancing performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks(HGNNs) have advanced mainly through better encoders, yet their decoding/projection stage still relies on a single shared linear head, assuming it can map rich node embeddings to labels. We call this the Linear Projection Bottleneck: in heterogeneous graphs, contextual diversity and long-tail shifts make a global head miss fine semantics, overfit hub nodes, and underserve tail nodes. While Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) could help, naively applying it clashes with structural imbalance and risks expert collapse. We propose a Heterogeneous-aware Orthogonal Prototype Experts framework named HOPE, a plug-and-play replacement for the standard prediction head. HOPE uses learnable prototype-based routing to assign instances to experts by similarity, letting expert usage follow the natural long-tail distribution, and adds expert orthogonalization to encourage diversity and prevent collapse. Experiments on four real datasets show consistent gains across SOTA HGNN backbones with minimal overhead.

### [131] [Buffered AUC maximization for scoring systems via mixed-integer optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05544)
*Moe Shiina,Shunnosuke Ikeda,Yuichi Takano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) framework to create scoring systems by directly maximizing buffered AUC (bAUC), outperforming baseline methods in AUC performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC is a critical evaluation metric for scoring systems, but previous MIO techniques did not directly optimize it. This study aims to fill that gap by maximizing bAUC.

Method: The framework uses MILO to maximize bAUC under a group sparsity constraint, ensuring interpretability and limiting the number of variables.

Result: Experiments show the MILO method achieves higher AUC values than regularization and stepwise regression baselines.

Conclusion: The research advances MIO techniques for building interpretable scoring systems with improved AUC performance.

Abstract: A scoring system is a linear classifier composed of a small number of explanatory variables, each assigned a small integer coefficient. This system is highly interpretable and allows predictions to be made with simple manual calculations without the need for a calculator. Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system. Computational experiments using publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our MILO method can build scoring systems with superior AUC values compared to the baseline methods based on regularization and stepwise regression. This research contributes to the advancement of MIO techniques for developing highly interpretable classification models.

### [132] [Learn to Evolve: Self-supervised Neural JKO Operator for Wasserstein Gradient Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05583)
*Xue Feng,Li Wang,Deanna Needell,Rongjie Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised method to learn the JKO solution operator, avoiding costly repeated subproblem computations, and demonstrates its effectiveness through numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The JKO scheme is computationally expensive due to repeated subproblem solutions, limiting its practical use. The paper aims to overcome this by learning a JKO operator directly.

Method: A Learn-to-Evolve algorithm alternates between generating trajectories and updating the JKO operator, using initial densities for training and enhancing generalization through data augmentation.

Result: The proposed method shows accuracy, stability, and robustness across various energies and initial conditions in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The self-supervised approach efficiently learns the JKO operator, bypassing traditional computational bottlenecks and improving practical applicability.

Abstract: The Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme provides a stable variational framework for computing Wasserstein gradient flows, but its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of repeatedly solving the JKO subproblems. We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions.

TL;DR: The paper connects Poisson hyperplane processes (PHP) with two-layer ReLU neural networks, showing PHP with a Gaussian prior as an alternative probabilistic representation. It proposes scalability via decomposition and an annealed sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, outperforming classic ReLU networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a novel probabilistic link between PHP and ReLU networks, aiming for scalable and efficient Bayesian inference in neural networks.

Method: Introduces PHP with Gaussian prior as a probabilistic analog to ReLU networks, proposes decomposition for scalability, and develops an annealed sequential Monte Carlo algorithm.

Result: Numerical experiments show the proposed method outperforms classic two-layer ReLU networks.

Conclusion: The PHP-based approach offers a scalable and effective alternative to traditional ReLU networks, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Neural networks have shown state-of-the-art performances in various classification and regression tasks. Rectified linear units (ReLU) are often used as activation functions for the hidden layers in a neural network model. In this article, we establish the connection between the Poisson hyperplane processes (PHP) and two-layer ReLU neural networks. We show that the PHP with a Gaussian prior is an alternative probabilistic representation to a two-layer ReLU neural network. In addition, we show that a two-layer neural network constructed by PHP is scalable to large-scale problems via the decomposition propositions. Finally, we propose an annealed sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the classic two-layer ReLU neural network. The implementation of our proposed model is available at https://github.com/ShufeiGe/Pois_Relu.git.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaCoRe is a parallel reasoning framework that scales test-time compute beyond sequential limits, improving performance across domains, notably mathematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitation of language models' inability to scale test-time compute beyond sequential reasoning under fixed context windows.

Method: Uses parallel exploration coordinated via message-passing, synthesizing findings across rounds, trained with outcome-based reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves strong improvements, e.g., an 8B model scores 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2%.

Conclusion: PaCoRe successfully scales reasoning beyond sequential limits and outperforms frontier systems.

Abstract: We introduce Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe), a training-and-inference framework designed to overcome a central limitation of contemporary language models: their inability to scale test-time compute (TTC) far beyond sequential reasoning under a fixed context window. PaCoRe departs from the traditional sequential paradigm by driving TTC through massive parallel exploration coordinated via a message-passing architecture in multiple rounds. Each round launches many parallel reasoning trajectories, compacts their findings into context-bounded messages, and synthesizes these messages to guide the next round and ultimately produce the final answer. Trained end-to-end with large-scale, outcome-based reinforcement learning, the model masters the synthesis abilities required by PaCoRe and scales to multi-million-token effective TTC without exceeding context limits. The approach yields strong improvements across diverse domains, and notably pushes reasoning beyond frontier systems in mathematics: an 8B model reaches 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2% by scaling effective TTC to roughly two million tokens. We open-source model checkpoints, training data, and the full inference pipeline to accelerate follow-up work.

### [135] [Good Allocations from Bad Estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05597)
*Sílvia Casacuberta,Moritz Hardt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that coarse treatment effect estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocation, reducing sample complexity from O(M/ε²) to O(M/ε) while maintaining effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize treatment allocation in heterogeneous populations with fewer samples, challenging the traditional CATE approach's higher sample requirements.

Method: The paper introduces an algorithm leveraging coarse treatment effect estimates and budget flexibility to reduce sample complexity without sacrificing allocation quality.

Result: Results show the algorithm achieves near-optimal treatment allocations with significantly fewer samples (O(M/ε)) compared to CATE (O(M/ε²)), validated on real-world RCT datasets.

Conclusion: The key takeaway is that treatment allocation requires fewer samples than precise effect estimation, offering a more efficient approach for practical applications.

Abstract: Conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation is the de facto gold standard for targeting a treatment to a heterogeneous population. The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $ε> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/ε^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $ε$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/ε)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples. Our work highlights the fundamental distinction between treatment effect estimation and treatment allocation: the latter requires far fewer samples.

*Zijun Min,Bingshuai Liu,Ante Wang,Long Zhang,Anxiang Zeng,Haibo Zhang,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DHPO bridges token-level and sequence-level RLVR methods for stable, high-performance optimization in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods (GRPO, GSPO) have complementary strengths but suffer from instability or loss of granularity.

Method: Dynamic Hybrid Policy Optimization (DHPO) combines token- and sequence-level importance ratios with clipping strategies.

Result: DHPO outperforms GRPO and GSPO across seven math reasoning benchmarks on Qwen3 models.

Conclusion: DHPO offers a balanced, stable approach for optimizing language models in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising framework for optimizing large language models in reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR algorithms focus on different granularities, and each has complementary strengths and limitations. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) updates the policy with token-level importance ratios, which preserves fine-grained credit assignment but often suffers from high variance and instability. In contrast, Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) applies single sequence-level importance ratios across all tokens in a response that better matches sequence-level rewards, but sacrifices token-wise credit assignment. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Policy Optimization (DHPO) to bridge GRPO and GSPO within a single clipped surrogate objective. DHPO combines token-level and sequence-level importance ratios using weighting mechanisms. We explore two variants of the mixing mechanism, including an averaged mixing and an entropy-guided mixing. To further stabilize training, we employ a branch-specific clipping strategy that constrains token-level and sequence-level ratios within separate trust regions before mixing, preventing outliers in either branch from dominating the update. Across seven challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, experiments on both dense and MoE models from the Qwen3 series show that DHPO consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO. We will release our code upon acceptance of this paper.

*Yiming Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Hao Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PiXTime is a novel federated learning model for time series forecasting, addressing multi-granularity and heterogeneous variable sets across nodes with personalized Patch Embedding and a global VE Table. It achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series data is valuable but often non-shareable, and federated learning faces challenges due to diverse sampling standards and variable sets across nodes. PiXTime aims to overcome these issues.

Method: PiXTime uses personalized Patch Embedding to unify time series dimensions and a global VE Table for variable alignment. A transformer-based shared model captures auxiliary series representations and uses cross-attention for target series prediction.

Result: PiXTime achieves state-of-the-art performance in federated settings and outperforms eight real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: PiXTime effectively addresses federated learning challenges for time series forecasting, demonstrating superior performance and cross-node transferability.

Abstract: Time series are highly valuable and rarely shareable across nodes, making federated learning a promising paradigm to leverage distributed temporal data. However, different sampling standards lead to diverse time granularities and variable sets across nodes, hindering classical federated learning. We propose PiXTime, a novel time series forecasting model designed for federated learning that enables effective prediction across nodes with multi-granularity and heterogeneous variable sets. PiXTime employs a personalized Patch Embedding to map node-specific granularity time series into token sequences of a unified dimension for processing by a subsequent shared model, and uses a global VE Table to align variable category semantics across nodes, thereby enhancing cross-node transferability. With a transformer-based shared model, PiXTime captures representations of auxiliary series with arbitrary numbers of variables and uses cross-attention to enhance the prediction of the target series. Experiments show PiXTime achieves state-of-the-art performance in federated settings and demonstrates superior performance on eight widely used real-world traditional benchmarks.

*Zhi Wang,Zhongbin Wu,Yanni Li,Bing Liu,Guangxi Li,Yuping Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) to address catastrophic forgetting and ensure positive knowledge transfer in sequential tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning (CL) methods focus on mitigating catastrophic forgetting (CF) but overlook positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT). The paper aims to optimize CL tasks for both positive FKT and BKT.

Method: ETCL models CL as an optimization problem, using task-specific binary masks to isolate sub-networks, gradient alignment for positive FKT, and bi-objective optimization for positive BKT. It also includes online task similarity detection.

Result: ETCL demonstrates superior performance over baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences, achieving forgetting-free and positive KT.

Conclusion: ETCL effectively balances learning plasticity and memory stability while ensuring positive knowledge transfer, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Existing research on continual learning (CL) of a sequence of tasks focuses mainly on dealing with catastrophic forgetting (CF) to balance the learning plasticity of new tasks and the memory stability of old tasks. However, an ideal CL agent should not only be able to overcome CF, but also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT), i.e., using the learned knowledge from previous tasks for the new task learning (namely FKT), and improving the previous tasks' performance with the knowledge of the new task (namely BKT). To this end, this paper first models CL as an optimization problem in which each sequential learning task aims to achieve its optimal performance under the constraint that both FKT and BKT should be positive. It then proposes a novel Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) method, which achieves forgetting-free and positive KT. Furthermore, the bounds that can lead to negative FKT and BKT are estimated theoretically. Based on the bounds, a new strategy for online task similarity detection is also proposed to facilitate positive KT. To overcome CF, ETCL learns a set of task-specific binary masks to isolate a sparse sub-network for each task while preserving the performance of a dense network for the task. At the beginning of a new task learning, ETCL tries to align the new task's gradient with that of the sub-network of the previous most similar task to ensure positive FKT. By using a new bi-objective optimization strategy and an orthogonal gradient projection method, ETCL updates only the weights of previous similar tasks at the classification layer to achieve positive BKT. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences.

*Xinyue Wang,Stephen Wang,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers trained autoregressively encode time-delayed causal structures in representations, enabling causal graph recovery from gradient sensitivities without explicit causal objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover how transformers naturally learn causal structures from time series data and leverage this for improved causal discovery.

Method: Theoretical proof under standard identifiability conditions and practical extraction using aggregated gradient attributions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms, especially with nonlinear dynamics, long-term dependencies, and non-stationary systems.

Conclusion: This work bridges foundation models and causal discovery, offering interpretability and scalability for causal analysis.

Abstract: We reveal that transformers trained in an autoregressive manner naturally encode time-delayed causal structures in their learned representations. When predicting future values in multivariate time series, the gradient sensitivities of transformer outputs with respect to past inputs directly recover the underlying causal graph, without any explicit causal objectives or structural constraints. We prove this connection theoretically under standard identifiability conditions and develop a practical extraction method using aggregated gradient attributions. On challenging cases such as nonlinear dynamics, long-term dependencies, and non-stationary systems, this approach greatly surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art discovery algorithms, especially as data heterogeneity increases, exhibiting scaling potential where causal accuracy improves with data volume and heterogeneity, a property traditional methods lack. This unifying view lays the groundwork for a future paradigm where causal discovery operates through the lens of foundation models, and foundation models gain interpretability and enhancement through the lens of causality.

*Miguel Matey-Sanz,Joaquín Torres-Sospedra,Joaquín Huerta,Sergio Trilles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a clustering-based method to improve Wi-Fi fingerprinting for indoor positioning by structuring datasets and applying localized learning models, reducing errors but slightly lowering floor detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in Wi-Fi fingerprinting due to dataset size, heterogeneity, and signal variability, particularly in large or multi-floor environments, to enhance localization accuracy.

Method: Introduces clustering based on spatial or radio features at building or floor levels. Localization uses clustering estimation and operates within selected clusters.

Result: Consistent reduction in localization errors, especially with building-level strategies, albeit with reduced floor detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Clustering-based structuring is effective and flexible for scalable indoor positioning, improving accuracy despite minor trade-offs.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting remains one of the most practical solutions for indoor positioning, however, its performance is often limited by the size and heterogeneity of fingerprint datasets, strong Received Signal Strength Indicator variability, and the ambiguity introduced in large and multi-floor environments. These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic framework `(k, ε)-unstable' to improve SmoothLLM's certification against jailbreaking attacks, making it more practical and trustworthy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The strict `k-unstable' assumption in SmoothLLM limits its practical trustworthiness, prompting the need for a more realistic certification framework.

Method: The authors propose `(k, ε)-unstable,' a probabilistic framework, and derive a data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability.

Result: The new framework provides actionable safety guarantees and better reflects real-world LLM behavior against diverse jailbreaking attacks.

Conclusion: This work offers a practical, theoretically-grounded solution to enhance LLM resistance against safety alignment exploitation.

Abstract: The SmoothLLM defense provides a certification guarantee against jailbreaking attacks, but it relies on a strict `k-unstable' assumption that rarely holds in practice. This strong assumption can limit the trustworthiness of the provided safety certificate. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic probabilistic framework, `(k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable,' to certify defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks, from gradient-based (GCG) to semantic (PAIR). We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment.

*George Ma,Zhongyuan Liang,Irene Y. Chen,Somayeh Sojoudi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) often identify features linked to linguistic artifacts rather than genuine reasoning processes in large language models (LLMs), as demonstrated by token-level interventions and falsification tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine whether SAEs uncover authentic reasoning features in LLMs or merely superficial linguistic patterns.

Method: A falsification framework combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test feature activation across 20 configurations.

Result: Most features (59%-94%) are triggered by token-level interventions, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. No feature meets criteria for genuine reasoning.

Conclusion: SAE features identified by contrastive methods largely capture linguistic correlates, not true reasoning computations.

Abstract: We investigate whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) identify genuine reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance. Together, these results suggest that SAE features identified by contrastive approaches primarily capture linguistic correlates of reasoning rather than the underlying reasoning computations themselves.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets to evaluate LLMs' vulnerabilities to conversational attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the persistent threat of multi-turn conversational attacks exploiting psychological principles like FITD to bypass LLM safety alignments. Current defenses rely on manual dataset creation, which is hard to scale.

Method: The authors operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal and offensive content. They evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under multi-turn and single-turn conditions.

Result: GPT-family models show significant vulnerability to conversational history (ASR increases by up to 32%). Gemini 2.5 Flash is nearly immune, while Claude 3 Haiku exhibits strong but imperfect resistance.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a critical divergence in LLM safety architectures' handling of conversational context, emphasizing the need for defenses against narrative-based manipulation.

Abstract: Multi-turn conversational attacks, which leverage psychological principles like Foot-in-the-Door (FITD), where a small initial request paves the way for a more significant one, to bypass safety alignments, pose a persistent threat to Large Language Models (LLMs). Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.

*Yeonsang Shin,Insoo Kim,Bongkeun Kim,Keonwoo Bae,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AGDC is a unified framework combining categorical prediction for discrete values and diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, addressing precision loss in hybrid discrete-continuous sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discretization-based approaches struggle with precision loss in high-precision domains like semiconductor circuit designs.

Method: AGDC uses a hybrid approach with EOS logit adjustment and length regularization, alongside ContLayNet benchmark.

Result: AGDC outperforms baselines in generating high-fidelity hybrid vector representations across domains.

Conclusion: AGDC enables scalable high-precision generation for diverse applications.

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models excel in data generation but are inherently constrained by their reliance on discretized tokens, which limits their ability to represent continuous values with high precision. We analyze the scalability limitations of existing discretization-based approaches for generating hybrid discrete-continuous sequences, particularly in high-precision domains such as semiconductor circuit designs, where precision loss can lead to functional failure. To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance. Experiments on semiconductor layouts (ContLayNet), graphic layouts, and SVGs demonstrate AGDC's superior performance in generating high-fidelity hybrid vector representations compared to discretization-based and fixed-schema baselines, achieving scalable high-precision generation across diverse domains.

### [145] [Tiny Recursive Models on ARC-AGI-1: Inductive Biases, Identity Conditioning, and Test-Time Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11847)
*Antonio Roye-Azar,Santiago Vargas-Naranjo,Dhruv Ghai,Nithin Balamurugan,Rayan Amir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRM's performance on ARC-AGI-1 tasks is driven by test-time compute efficiency, task-specific priors, and shallow recursion, not deep reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the contributors behind TRM's reported strong performance on ARC-style tasks, focusing on architecture, test-time compute, and priors.

Method: Empirical analysis of TRM on ARC-AGI-1, including ablation studies, recursion trajectory analysis, and comparisons with QLoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Performance largely stems from test-time augmentation, majority-vote ensembling, task IDs, and shallow recursion. TRM is more efficient than QLoRA fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TRM's success comes from efficiency and task-specific strategies, not deep reasoning.

Abstract: Tiny Recursive Models (TRM) were proposed as a parameter-efficient alternative to large language models for solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) style tasks. The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.

*Hongyaoxing Gul,Lijuan Hu,Shuzi Niu,Fangfang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLRQ introduces flexible low-rank quantization for LLMs, combining fast rank selection (R1-FLR) and optimized low-rank approximation (BLC) to outperform existing PTQ methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-rank PTQ methods require costly fine-tuning and fail to fully exploit potential due to rigid rank selection and computational overhead.

Method: FLRQ uses R1-FLR for outlier-aware rank extraction via Gaussian projection and BLC for minimizing quantization error through iterative scaling/clipping.

Result: FLRQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantization quality and algorithm efficiency.

Conclusion: FLRQ effectively addresses limitations of traditional PTQ by enabling fast, flexible rank selection and optimized approximation.

Abstract: Traditional post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered an effective approach to reduce model size and accelerate inference of large-scale language models (LLMs). However, existing low-rank PTQ methods require costly fine-tuning to determine a compromise rank for diverse data and layers in large models, failing to exploit their full potential. Additionally, the current SVD-based low-rank approximation compounds the computational overhead. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the varying effectiveness of low-rank approximation across different layers in representative models. Accordingly, we introduce \underline{F}lexible \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank \underline{Q}uantization (FLRQ), a novel solution designed to quickly identify the accuracy-optimal ranks and aggregate them to achieve minimal storage combinations. FLRQ comprises two powerful components, Rank1-Sketch-based Flexible Rank Selection (R1-FLR) and Best Low-rank Approximation under Clipping (BLC). R1-FLR applies the R1-Sketch with Gaussian projection for the fast low-rank approximation, enabling outlier-aware rank extraction for each layer. Meanwhile, BLC aims at minimizing the low-rank quantization error under the scaling and clipping strategy through an iterative method. FLRQ demonstrates strong effectiveness and robustness in comprehensive experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both quantization quality and algorithm efficiency.

*Yongyi Yang,Jianyang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: mHC-lite simplifies Hyper-Connections by ensuring exact doubly stochastic matrices via convex combinations of permutation matrices, improving stability and efficiency without specialized CUDA kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address instability and approximation gaps in DeepSeek's Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) caused by inexact doubly stochastic matrices and specialized CUDA requirements.

Method: Reparameterizes residual matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices, guaranteeing exact doubly stochasticity using native matrix operations.

Result: mHC-lite matches or outperforms mHC in performance, enhances training throughput, and eliminates residual instabilities.

Conclusion: mHC-lite offers a simpler, more portable, and stable alternative to mHC, with comparable or superior performance.

Abstract: Hyper-Connections (HC) generalizes residual connections by introducing dynamic residual matrices that mix information across multiple residual streams, accelerating convergence in deep neural networks. However, unconstrained residual matrices can compromise training stability. To address this, DeepSeek's Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) approximately projects these matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope via iterative Sinkhorn--Knopp (SK) normalization. We identify two limitations of this approach: (i) finite SK iterations do not guarantee exact doubly stochasticity, leaving an approximation gap that can accumulate through network depth and undermine stability; (ii) efficient SK implementation requires highly specialized CUDA kernels, raising engineering barriers and reducing portability. Motivated by the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem, we propose mHC-lite, a simple reparameterization that explicitly constructs doubly stochastic matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices. This approach guarantees exact doubly stochasticity by construction and can be implemented using only native matrix operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mHC-lite matches or exceeds mHC in performance while achieving higher training throughput with a naive implementation and eliminating the residual instabilities observed in both HC and mHC. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/FFTYYY/mhc-lite.

*Turkan Simge Ispak,Salih Tileylioglu,Erdem Akagunduz*

TL;DR: The study reframes P-wave detection as a self-supervised task, finding attention-based Variational Autoencoders outperform skip connections in noise-heavy strong-motion records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate P-wave detection is crucial for earthquake early warning, but strong-motion records suffer from noise, limited labeled data, and complex waveforms.

Method: A grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations compared reconstruction fidelity and anomaly discrimination, focusing on skip connections and attention mechanisms.

Result: Attention mechanisms outperformed skip connections, achieving an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 near-source, while skip connections suffered from overgeneralization.

Conclusion: Architectural constraints favoring global context over perfect reconstruction are key for robust P-wave detection in early warning systems.

Abstract: Accurate P-wave detection is critical for earthquake early warning, yet strong-motion records pose challenges due to high noise levels, limited labeled data, and complex waveform characteristics. This study reframes P-wave arrival detection as a self-supervised anomaly detection task to evaluate how architectural variations regulate the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and anomaly discrimination. Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce "overgeneralization", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications. These findings establish that architectural constraints favoring global context over pixel-perfect reconstruction are essential for robust, self-supervised P-wave detection.

*Yifan Zhang,Wei Bi,Kechi Zhang,Dongming Jin,Jie Fu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Discrete Transformer bridges the gap between continuous and discrete logic, enabling the extraction of human-readable programs from trained models without human-written code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional algorithm extraction struggles with Transformers due to superposition, where entangled features obscure symbolic expressions. This work aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: Proposes the Discrete Transformer, enforcing functional disentanglement (Numerical Attention for routing, Numerical MLP for arithmetic) and using temperature-annealed sampling.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines and extends interpretability to continuous domains. Shows a phase transition in annealing and enables program control via inductive biases.

Conclusion: The Discrete Transformer is a robust framework for demonstration-free algorithm discovery and enhances Transformer interpretability.

Abstract: Algorithm extraction aims to synthesize executable programs directly from models trained on specific algorithmic tasks, enabling de novo algorithm discovery without relying on human-written code. However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases. Collectively, these findings establish the Discrete Transformer as a robust framework for demonstration-free algorithm discovery, offering a rigorous pathway toward Transformer interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tensor-DTI is a contrastive learning framework integrating multimodal embeddings for improved drug-target interaction prediction, outperforming existing models and showing promise in virtual screening applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drug-target interaction models rely on limited single-modality descriptors, motivating the need for a multimodal approach to enhance accuracy and representativeness.

Method: Tensor-DTI combines molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions using a siamese dual-encoder architecture to capture chemical and structural features.

Result: Tensor-DTI outperforms benchmarks on DTI prediction and shows competitive performance in large-scale inference and enrichment studies, even in family-holdout scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal information with contrastive learning improves interaction prediction accuracy and offers more interpretable models for virtual screening.

Abstract: Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is essential for computational drug discovery, yet existing models often rely on single-modality predefined molecular descriptors or sequence-based embeddings with limited representativeness. We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multimodal information with contrastive objectives to enhance interaction-prediction accuracy and to provide more interpretable and reliability-aware models for virtual screening.

*Mohamed Amine Hallam,Kuo-Kun Tseng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how positional encoding fusion methods impact Transformer performance, finding negligible effects on short texts but significant gains for long sequences, advocating for explicit fusion design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine if the mechanism for fusing positional encodings with token embeddings affects Transformer performance, especially in long-sequence scenarios, challenging the assumption that fusion is trivial.

Method: Empirical comparison of three fusion strategies (element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, scalar gated fusion) under controlled conditions, tested across datasets with varying sequence lengths.

Result: Fusion strategy choice yields consistent performance improvements for long documents but minimal impact on short texts, validated through paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparisons.

Conclusion: Positional-encoding fusion is a meaningful design choice for long-sequence Transformers, warranting explicit consideration rather than defaulting to fixed methods.

Abstract: Transformers require positional encodings to represent sequence order, yet most prior work focuses on designing new positional encodings rather than examining how positional information is fused with token embeddings. In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.

*Enrique Feito-Casares,Francisco M. Melgarejo-Meseguer,José-Luis Rojo-Álvarez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes RKHS-based algorithms for manifold learning by reconstructing data points and aligning kernels for effective embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing interest in representation learning to uncover latent structures in high-dimensional data.

Method: Reconstruction-based manifold learning in RKHS using autorepresentation and kernel alignment.

Result: Effective embeddings demonstrated on simulated and real datasets.

Conclusion: Extends autorepresentation theory with practical success in manifold learning.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in representation learning approaches that uncover the latent structure of high-dimensional data, this work proposes new algorithms for reconstruction-based manifold learning within Reproducing-Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Each observation is first reconstructed as a linear combination of the other samples in the RKHS, by optimizing a vector form of the Representer Theorem for their autorepresentation property. A separable operator-valued kernel extends the formulation to vector-valued data while retaining the simplicity of a single scalar similarity function. A subsequent kernel-alignment task projects the data into a lower-dimensional latent space whose Gram matrix aims to match the high-dimensional reconstruction kernel, thus transferring the auto-reconstruction geometry of the RKHS to the embedding. Therefore, the proposed algorithms represent an extended approach to the autorepresentation property, exhibited by many natural data, by using and adapting well-known results of Kernel Learning Theory. Numerical experiments on both simulated (concentric circles and swiss-roll) and real (cancer molecular activity and IoT network intrusions) datasets provide empirical evidence of the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Zhanpei Huang,Taochen chen,Fangqing Gu,Yiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel DSTS framework is proposed to analyze eye movement data for ASD detection, outperforming traditional and deep learning models by focusing on local temporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASD diagnosis via eye movement data is promising but requires modeling of short-term dependencies, which global attention mechanisms in Transformers fail to efficiently address.

Method: The DSTS framework incorporates Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms to capture discrete, short-term gaze patterns.

Result: DSTS surpasses traditional machine learning and deep learning models in detecting ASD from eye movement datasets.

Conclusion: Focusing on localized temporal dependencies in eye movement data enhances ASD detection accuracy, offering a more effective diagnostic tool.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and behavioral patterns. Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models.

TL;DR: Introduces Poisson NMF with a shifted-log link function to relax the additive combination assumption, offering flexibility between additive and multiplicative interactions. Provides efficient algorithms and demonstrates improved interpretability in real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Poisson NMF methods assume additive combination of parts, which may not fit all settings. The shifted-log link function offers a more flexible alternative.

Method: Proposes Poisson NMF with a shifted-log link function, introducing a tuning parameter to vary between additive and multiplicative interactions. Develops efficient algorithms for fitting and computation.

Result: Demonstrates on real datasets that the shifted-log link can substantively impact results and improve interpretability compared to standard additive models.

Conclusion: The shifted-log link function enhances Poisson NMF's flexibility and interpretability, particularly in settings where additive assumptions are inadequate.

Abstract: Poisson non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used method to find interpretable "parts-based" decompositions of count data. While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the "parts" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets. Our examples show how the choice of link function in Poisson NMF can substantively impact the results, and how in some settings the use of a shifted-log link function may improve interpretability compared with the standard, additive link.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming exploration collapse and semantic homogeneity in RLVR for LLMs, which causes narrow, over-optimized behaviors.

Method: Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO) shifts exploration to topological branching of reasoning trajectories, using Information Bottleneck as a filter and self-reward.

Result: IIB-LPO outperforms prior methods by up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: IIB-LPO effectively diversifies reasoning paths and enhances performance in RLVR for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning have been hindered by a persistent challenge: exploration collapse. The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning framework replaces traditional patching methods in solving scale-dependent differential equations by promoting integration constants to scale-dependent functions, ensuring globally valid solutions without boundary matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional patching methods for solving complicated differential equations often fail due to breakdowns near matching boundaries. A more robust approach is needed.

Method: The proposed framework integrates asymptotic analytic solutions by treating integration constants as scale-dependent functions, constrained by the original equation.

Result: The framework successfully reproduces global solutions in chemical kinetics and cosmology, outperforming conventional matching procedures.

Conclusion: This learning-based approach provides a seamless and accurate alternative to traditional patching methods for solving scale-dependent differential equations.

Abstract: In many problems in physics and engineering, one encounters complicated differential equations with strongly scale-dependent terms for which exact analytical or numerical solutions are not available. A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology, where it accurately reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures.

*Ayoub Ajarra,Debabrota Basu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness auditing challenges in machine learning models that adaptively update, proposing a framework to audit properties like group fairness efficiently under arbitrary shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auditing machine learning models for bias is crucial, but complicated by adaptive updates that alter model classes while preserving certain properties, raising questions about reliable auditing under such shifts.

Method: The authors introduce a PAC auditing framework based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle, focusing on group fairness under arbitrary updates. They propose the SP dimension to measure strategic update complexity.

Result: Distribution-free auditing bounds are established for statistical parity, characterized by the SP dimension. The framework also extends to other auditing objectives like prediction error and robust risk.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable and efficient framework for auditing fairness under model updates, with applications extending beyond group fairness.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly embedded in societal infrastructure, auditing them for bias is of growing importance. However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.
  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.
  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in distillation methods for scenarios where only specific classes or intermediate concepts are relevant, SubDistill focuses on distilling only pertinent components.

Method: Introduces SubDistill, a distillation algorithm targeting relevant subtasks at each layer, tested on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with Convolutional and Transformer models.

Result: SubDistill outperforms existing layer-wise distillation techniques and achieves student models that better match teacher decision structures.

Conclusion: SubDistill enhances distillation efficiency for relevant subtasks, validated by superior performance and explainable AI analyses.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation involves transferring the predictive capabilities of large, high-performing AI models (teachers) to smaller models (students) that can operate in environments with limited computing power. In this paper, we address the scenario in which only a few classes and their associated intermediate concepts are relevant to distill. This scenario is common in practice, yet few existing distillation methods explicitly focus on the relevant subtask. To address this gap, we introduce 'SubDistill', a new distillation algorithm with improved numerical properties that only distills the relevant components of the teacher model at each layer. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with Convolutional and Transformer models demonstrate that SubDistill outperforms existing layer-wise distillation techniques on a representative set of subtasks.

*Sidney Shapiro,Burhanuddin Panvelwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Meta's Prophet as a reproducible forecasting tool, comparing it with ARIMA and Random Forest, highlighting its interpretability and standardization advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing reproducibility challenges in forecasting, especially in business and finance, where traditional methods lack transparency and machine learning lacks interpretability.

Method: Comparative analysis using Prophet, ARIMA variants, and Random Forest on public datasets with a controlled, documented experimental design.

Result: Prophet balances interpretability and reproducibility, offering standardized workflows and transparency in forecasting.

Conclusion: Prophet serves as a practical tool for reproducible forecasting, supporting verification and methodological rigor in research and practice.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a persistent challenge in forecasting research and practice, particularly in business and financial analytics where forecasts inform high-stakes decisions. Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet's role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor. This work provides researchers and practitioners with a practical reference framework for reproducible forecasting in Python-based research workflows.

### [160] [On the Robustness of Age for Learning-Based Wireless Scheduling in Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05956)
*Juaren Steiger,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a learning-based scheduling policy using head-of-line age instead of virtual queue length for better robustness in networks with abrupt channel changes, matching state-of-the-art performance and ensuring stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for wireless scheduling under unknown channel conditions may fail when constraints become infeasible due to abrupt changes, leading to unbounded virtual queue growth.

Method: The authors replace virtual queue length with head-of-line age (age of the oldest packet) in algorithm design, creating a more robust scheduling policy.

Result: The new policy performs as well as state-of-the-art methods under stable conditions and maintains stability during abrupt channel changes, recovering quickly from infeasibility.

Conclusion: Using head-of-line age improves robustness and stability in scheduling policies, especially in dynamic networks with abrupt channel variations.

Abstract: The constrained combinatorial multi-armed bandit model has been widely employed to solve problems in wireless networking and related areas, including the problem of wireless scheduling for throughput optimization under unknown channel conditions. Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughput constraint violation. These algorithms seek to minimize the virtual queue length in their algorithm design. However, in networks where channel conditions change abruptly, the resulting constraints may become infeasible, leading to unbounded growth in virtual queue lengths. In this paper, we make the key observation that the dynamics of the head-of-line age, i.e. the age of the oldest packet in the virtual queue, make it more robust when used in algorithm design compared to the virtual queue length. We therefore design a learning-based scheduling policy that uses the head-of-line age in place of the virtual queue length. We show that our policy matches state-of-the-art performance under i.i.d. network conditions. Crucially, we also show that the system remains stable even under abrupt changes in channel conditions and can rapidly recover from periods of constraint infeasibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an anomaly detection framework for IoT sensor networks using Communities of Interest (CoIs), leveraging fused similarity metrics and autoencoder models for robust performance within communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of organizing and analyzing large-scale heterogeneous IoT sensor networks efficiently by grouping devices with similar characteristics.

Method: Groups sensors into CoIs using a fused similarity matrix (temporal, spatial, elevation). Trains autoencoder models (BiLSTM, LSTM, MLP) with Bayesian optimization and evaluates performance within and across communities.

Result: Shows robust anomaly detection within communities but varying performance across them, supporting community-based model sharing to reduce computational costs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces computational overhead and enhances model generalizability across IoT sensor networks.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to large-scale sensor networks that monitor environmental and urban phenomena in real time. Communities of Interest (CoIs) provide a promising paradigm for organising heterogeneous IoT sensor networks by grouping devices with similar operational and environmental characteristics. This work presents an anomaly detection framework based on the CoI paradigm by grouping sensors into communities using a fused similarity matrix that incorporates temporal correlations via Spearman coefficients, spatial proximity using Gaussian distance decay, and elevation similarities. For each community, representative stations based on the best silhouette are selected and three autoencoder architectures (BiLSTM, LSTM, and MLP) are trained using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with expanding window cross-validation and tested on stations from the same cluster and the best representative stations of other clusters. The models are trained on normal temperature patterns of the data and anomalies are detected through reconstruction error analysis. Experimental results show a robust within-community performance across the evaluated configurations, while variations across communities are observed. Overall, the results support the applicability of community-based model sharing in reducing computational overhead and to analyse model generalisability across IoT sensor networks.

*Þór Sverrisson,Steinn Guðmundsson*

TL;DR: LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector, uses wider temporal EEG windows to improve seizure detection across diverse datasets and recording conditions, achieving strong performance and clinical viability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated seizure detection is challenging due to variability in EEG data across patients and settings. Clinicians use surrounding context for interpretation, inspiring a need for models that mimic this approach.

Method: LookAroundNet employs transformer architecture to analyze EEG signals within an extended temporal window, incorporating context before and after the segment of interest. It is evaluated on multiple datasets, including clinical and ambulatory EEG recordings.

Result: The model demonstrates strong performance across diverse datasets and unseen recording conditions, with computational efficiency suitable for clinical use. Extended temporal context, diverse training data, and ensembling enhance performance.

Conclusion: LookAroundNet advances automatic seizure detection toward clinical applicability by leveraging wider EEG context and diverse training data, offering a robust solution across varying conditions.

Abstract: Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) remains difficult due to the large variability of seizure dynamics across patients, recording conditions, and clinical settings. We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.

*Yingzhuo Liu,Shuodi Liu,Weijun Luo,Liuyu Xiang,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Simulation-Free PSRO addresses the computational bottleneck of PSRO by replacing game simulation with a Dynamic Window mechanism, improving efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational cost of PSRO, particularly game simulation, limits its practical application.

Method: Introduces Simulation-Free PSRO and Dynamic Window-based PSRO, using Nash Clustering for strategy elimination.

Result: Dynamic Window reduces exploitability and shows excellent compatibility in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves PSRO's efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) combines game-theoretic equilibrium computation with learning and is effective in approximating Nash Equilibrium in zero-sum games. However, the computational cost of PSRO has become a significant limitation to its practical application. Our analysis shows that game simulation is the primary bottleneck in PSRO's runtime. To address this issue, we conclude the concept of Simulation-Free PSRO and summarize existing methods that instantiate this concept. Additionally, we propose a novel Dynamic Window-based Simulation-Free PSRO, which introduces the concept of a strategy window to replace the original strategy set maintained in PSRO. The number of strategies in the strategy window is limited, thereby simplifying opponent strategy selection and improving the robustness of the best response. Moreover, we use Nash Clustering to select the strategy to be eliminated, ensuring that the number of strategies within the strategy window is effectively limited. Our experiments across various environments demonstrate that the Dynamic Window mechanism significantly reduces exploitability compared to existing methods, while also exhibiting excellent compatibility. Our code is available at https://github.com/enochliu98/SF-PSRO.

### [164] [On the Transition to an Auction-based Intelligent Parking Assignment System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05429)
*Levente Alekszejenkó,Dobrowiecki Tadeusz*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Auction-based parking assignment improves traffic flow and parking proximity but increases costs for participants and non-participants, encouraging broader adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the benefits of auction-based parking assignment by simulating voluntary adoption before mandatory implementation.

Method: Conducted Eclipse SUMO simulations with varying participant rates to analyze traffic flow, system performance, and financial outcomes.

Result: Higher penetration rates improved traffic flow and parking proximity for participants but increased parking costs for all, motivating non-participants to join.

Conclusion: Auction-based parking assignment shows promise but requires careful consideration of cost impacts to ensure wide acceptance.

Abstract: Finding a free parking space in a city has become a challenging task over the past decades. A recently proposed auction-based parking assignment can alleviate cruising for parking and also set a market-driven, demand-responsive parking price. However, the wide acceptance of such a system is far from certain.
  To evaluate the merits of auction-based parking assignment, we assume that drivers have access to a smartphone-based reservation system prior to its mandatory introduction and thus have the opportunity to test and experience its merits voluntarily. We set our experiment as Eclipse SUMO simulations with different rates of participants and non-participants to check how different market penetration levels affect the traffic flow, the performance of the auction-based assignment system, and the financial outcomes. The results show that the auction-based system improves traffic flow with increasing penetration rates, allowing participants to park gradually closer to their preferred parking lots. However, it comes with a price; the system also increases parking expenditures for participants. Interestingly, non-participating drivers will face even higher parking prices. Consequently, they will be motivated to use the new system.

### [165] [EvidFuse: Writing-Time Evidence Learning for Consistent Text-Chart Data Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05487)
*Huanxiang Lin,Qianyue Wang,Jinwu Hu,Bailin Chen,Qing Du,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: EvidFuse is a multi-agent framework enabling real-time interleaving of text and charts in data-driven reports, addressing inconsistency and shallow analysis in staged LLM pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based systems suffer from chart-text inconsistency and insight freezing due to rigid staged pipelines.

Method: EvidFuse uses a Data-Augmented Analysis Agent and Real-Time Evidence Construction Writer to dynamically interleave text and visual evidence.

Result: EvidFuse outperforms in chart quality, alignment, and usefulness, ranking top in evaluations.

Conclusion: EvidFuse enhances data-driven reporting by enabling flexible, on-demand integration of visual evidence with narrative text.

Abstract: Data-driven reports communicate decision-relevant insights by tightly interleaving narrative text with charts grounded in underlying tables. However, current LLM-based systems typically generate narratives and visualizations in staged pipelines, following either a text-first-graph-second or a graph-first-text-second paradigm. These designs often lead to chart-text inconsistency and insight freezing, where the intermediate evidence space becomes fixed and the model can no longer retrieve or construct new visual evidence as the narrative evolves, resulting in shallow and predefined analysis. To address the limitations, we propose \textbf{EvidFuse}, a training-free multi-agent framework that enables writing-time text-chart interleaved generation for data-driven reports. EvidFuse decouples visualization analysis from long-form drafting via two collaborating components: a \textbf{Data-Augmented Analysis Agent}, equipped with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)-derived knowledge and access to raw tables, and a \textbf{Real-Time Evidence Construction Writer} that plans an outline and drafts the report while intermittently issuing fine-grained analysis requests. This design allows visual evidence to be constructed and incorporated exactly when the narrative requires it, directly constraining subsequent claims and enabling on-demand expansion of the evidence space. Experiments demonstrate that EvidFuse attains the top rank in both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations on chart quality, chart-text alignment, and report-level usefulness.

### [166] [How Exploration Breaks Cooperation in Shared-Policy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05509)
*Yi-Ning Weng,Hsuan-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Shared-policy Deep Q-Network learning in multi-agent systems can collapse cooperation due to exploration-driven updates biasing shared representations toward defection, even where cooperative equilibria are stable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates why shared-policy multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) fails to sustain cooperation in dynamic social dilemmas, despite favorable conditions.

Method: Controlled experiments using shared DQN explore convergence patterns, varying network sizes, exploration schedules, and payoff structures.

Result: Shared DQN collapses cooperation due to representational failure from partial observability and parameter coupling, not reward misalignment or noise.

Conclusion: Parameter sharing undermines cooperation in MARL; independent representations or removing sharing resolves this, guiding future system designs.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning in dynamic social dilemmas commonly relies on parameter sharing to enable scalability. We show that in shared-policy Deep Q-Network learning, standard exploration can induce a robust and systematic collapse of cooperation even in environments where fully cooperative equilibria are stable and payoff dominant. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that shared DQN converges to stable but persistently low-cooperation regimes. This collapse is not caused by reward misalignment, noise, or insufficient training, but by a representational failure arising from partial observability combined with parameter coupling across heterogeneous agent states. Exploration-driven updates bias the shared representation toward locally dominant defection responses, which then propagate across agents and suppress cooperative learning. We confirm that the failure persists across network sizes, exploration schedules, and payoff structures, and disappears when parameter sharing is removed or when agents maintain independent representations. These results identify a fundamental failure mode of shared-policy MARL and establish structural conditions under which scalable learning architectures can systematically undermine cooperation. Our findings provide concrete guidance for the design of multi-agent learning systems in social and economic environments where collective behavior is critical.

*Chen Han,Jin Tan,Bohan Yu,Wenzhen Zheng,Xijin Tang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper investigates how network topology influences conformity dynamics in LLM-based multi-agent systems during misinformation detection, comparing centralized and distributed decision paradigms for efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how LLM agents conform to group opinions in MAS and how network structures affect collective decision-making outcomes.

Method: A confidence-normalized pooling rule is introduced to balance self-reliance and social influence, tested through misinformation detection tasks using centralized and distributed decision paradigms.

Result: Centralized structures enable quick decisions but are vulnerable to hub competence and biases. Distributed structures offer robust consensus, though increased connectivity can lead to incorrect but confident decisions.

Conclusion: Network topology and self-social weighting critically impact the efficiency, robustness, and failure modes of collective decision-making in LLM-based MAS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly instantiated as interacting agents in multi-agent systems (MAS), where collective decisions emerge through social interaction rather than independent reasoning. A fundamental yet underexplored mechanism in this process is conformity, the tendency of agents to align their judgments with prevailing group opinions. This paper presents a systematic study of how network topology shapes conformity dynamics in LLM-based MAS through a misinformation detection task. We introduce a confidence-normalized pooling rule that controls the trade-off between self-reliance and social influence, enabling comparisons between two canonical decision paradigms: Centralized Aggregation and Distributed Consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that network topology critically governs both the efficiency and robustness of collective judgments. Centralized structures enable immediate decisions but are sensitive to hub competence and exhibit same-model alignment biases. In contrast, distributed structures promote more robust consensus, while increased network connectivity speeds up convergence but also heightens the risk of wrong-but-sure cascades, in which agents converge on incorrect decisions with high confidence. These findings characterize the conformity dynamics in LLM-based MAS, clarifying how network topology and self-social weighting jointly shape the efficiency, robustness, and failure modes of collective decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods address inland water monitoring issues in isolation; NAIAD aims to unify these efforts for comprehensive solutions.

Method: NAIAD uses RAG, LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, and computational graphs to synthesize knowledge from curated sources and execute tailored analyses.

Result: Performance metrics show 77% correctness and 85% relevancy, with strong adaptability across query types. Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) balance efficiency and reasoning best.

Conclusion: NAIAD offers a robust, adaptable, and user-friendly solution for inland water monitoring, bridging gaps in existing fragmented approaches.

Abstract: Inland water monitoring is vital for safeguarding public health and ecosystems, enabling timely interventions to mitigate risks. Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ontology-guided framework integrating LLMs with an AM knowledge graph for reliable knowledge extraction and extrapolation in additive manufacturing, improving coherence and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven AM approaches suffer from fragmented knowledge and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data, necessitating a more structured and reliable method.

Method: The framework encodes equations, variables, and assumptions into a formal ontology, uses LLMs conditioned on knowledge subgraphs for equation generation, and introduces a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment.

Result: The approach enhances structural coherence, quantitative reliability, and physical consistency in extrapolation compared to unguided LLMs.

Conclusion: The study establishes a pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation and confidence-based extrapolation, showcasing LLMs augmented by knowledge graphs as reliable tools for AM.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.

TL;DR: Study examines how personality traits affect cooperation in LLMs using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games, finding agreeableness as the key factor promoting cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how personality steering influences cooperative behavior in LLMs under controlled conditions.

Method: Used repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games to test cooperation, measuring personality profiles of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 using the Big Five Inventory.

Result: Agreeableness was the dominant factor promoting cooperation; later-generation models showed more selective cooperation.

Conclusion: Personality steering acts as a behavioral bias, not deterministic control, with implications for LLM agent design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents in strategic and social interactions. Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hyper-Enz, a knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for predicting enzyme-substrate interactions by leveraging chemical reaction equations and knowledge graph embedding, outperforming traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing enzyme-substrate interaction databases are sparse and labor-intensive, limiting traditional models' generalization. Chemical reaction equations offer denser data but involve complex relational patterns.

Method: The authors represent reactions as triples in a knowledge graph and propose Hyper-Enz, combining hypergraph transformers with KGE to model multi-compound interactions. A multi-expert paradigm aids learning.

Result: Hyper-Enz achieves up to 88% relative improvement in enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction over traditional models.

Conclusion: Hyper-Enz effectively addresses sparse data issues and complex relational patterns, demonstrating superior performance in predicting enzyme-substrate interactions.

Abstract: Predicting enzyme-substrate interactions has long been a fundamental problem in biochemistry and metabolic engineering. While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Persona conditioning in LLMs shows mixed effects on clinical decision-making, improving critical care tasks but degrading primary care, with interaction style and model type influencing outcomes. Human clinicians show moderate safety agreement but low confidence in reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to characterize how persona conditioning affects high-stakes clinical decision-making in LLMs, challenging the assumption that it monotonically improves expertise and safety.

Method: The research evaluates persona-based control in clinical LLMs by testing professional roles and interaction styles, assessing performance on clinical tasks using metrics like accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant behavior.

Result: Medical personas improve critical care tasks by up to 20% but harm primary care performance. Interaction style affects risk behavior, but model dependency varies. Human clinicians show moderate safety agreement but low confidence in reasoning.

Conclusion: Personas introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guaranteed safety or expertise, highlighting the nuanced impact of behavioral priors in clinical LLMs.

Abstract: Persona conditioning can be viewed as a behavioral prior for large language models (LLMs) and is often assumed to confer expertise and improve safety in a monotonic manner. However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\sim+20\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $κ= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding collective behavior of AI agents in multi-agent environments to predict artificial society dynamics.

Method: Adapted classic visual experiments from social psychology to study AI agents' responses to group influence.

Result: AI agents show systematic conformity bias, influenced by group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics, persisting across model scales.

Conclusion: The findings highlight security risks like manipulation and misinformation, emphasizing the need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

Abstract: As AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments, understanding their collective behavior becomes critical for predicting the dynamics of artificial societies. This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

Abstract: Standard safety alignment optimizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for universal helpfulness and honesty, effectively instilling a rigid "Boy Scout" morality. While robust for general-purpose assistants, this one-size-fits-all ethical framework imposes a "transparency tax" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding, such as public relations, negotiation, and crisis management. To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises. Spanning 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries, Crisis-Bench tasks an LLM-based Public Relations (PR) Agent with navigating a dynamic 7-day corporate crisis simulation while managing strictly separated Private and Public narrative states to enforce rigorous information asymmetry. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price. Crisis-Bench provides the first quantitative framework for assessing "Reputation Management" capabilities, arguing for a shift from rigid moral absolutism to context-aware professional alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates performance gains in chess by cheating a limited number of times using software tools, aiming to measure effectiveness rather than assist cheaters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cheating in chess via software advice is a significant issue, and understanding its impact is key to detection and prevention efforts.

Method: Developed and tested algorithms on a chess engine to measure performance gains from limited cheating instances.

Result: Findings likely quantify the advantage gained through cheating, aiding detection strategies.

Conclusion: The study highlights the practical impact of cheating and supports efforts to combat it.

Abstract: Cheating in chess, by using advice from powerful software, has become a major problem, reaching the highest levels. As opposed to the large majority of previous work, which concerned {\em detection} of cheating, here we try to evaluate the possible gain in performance, obtained by cheating a limited number of times during a game. Algorithms are developed and tested on a commonly used chess engine (i.e software).\footnote{Needless to say, the goal of this work is not to assist cheaters, but to measure the effectiveness of cheating -- which is crucial as part of the effort to contain and detect it.}

TL;DR: ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees) introduces hierarchical reasoning for transparent and contestable claim verification, outperforming baselines and improving trustworthiness in LLM decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of LLMs' outputs undermines trustworthiness in high-stakes decision-making, necessitating a method for explainable and contestable claim verification.

Method: ART hierarchically verifies claims by branching a root claim into supporting/attacking arguments, adjudicated by pairwise tournaments judged by an LLM.

Result: ART outperforms baselines, providing reliable and transparent claim verification, validated on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: ART sets a new benchmark for explainable claim verification, enhancing clarity and reliability in LLM decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful candidates for complex decision-making, leveraging vast encoded knowledge and remarkable zero-shot abilities. However, their adoption in high-stakes environments is hindered by their opacity; their outputs lack faithful explanations and cannot be effectively contested to correct errors, undermining trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies. Our findings show that ART's structured reasoning outperforms strong baselines, establishing a new benchmark for explainable claim verification which is more reliable and ensures clarity in the overall decision making step.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMUEChange is a multi-modal framework integrating diverse urban data for robust analysis of urban changes, outperforming baselines by 46.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rigid, single-modal approaches in remote sensing change detection limit urban environment analysis, prompting the need for flexible multi-modal integration.

Method: MMUEChange uses a modular toolkit and Modality Controller for cross- and intra-modal alignment to analyze heterogeneous urban data.

Result: Case studies highlight urban changes like park shifts, water pollution, and waste decline. MMUEChange excels with a 46.7% higher task success rate and reduced hallucination.

Conclusion: MMUEChange effectively supports complex urban change analysis with policy implications, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Understanding urban environment change is essential for sustainable development. However, current approaches, particularly remote sensing change detection, often rely on rigid, single-modal analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose MMUEChange, a multi-modal agent framework that flexibly integrates heterogeneous urban data via a modular toolkit and a core module, Modality Controller for cross- and intra-modal alignment, enabling robust analysis of complex urban change scenarios. Case studies include: a shift toward small, community-focused parks in New York, reflecting local green space efforts; the spread of concentrated water pollution across districts in Hong Kong, pointing to coordinated water management; and a notable decline in open dumpsites in Shenzhen, with contrasting links between nighttime economic activity and waste types, indicating differing urban pressures behind domestic and construction waste. Compared to the best-performing baseline, the MMUEChange agent achieves a 46.7% improvement in task success rate and effectively mitigates hallucination, demonstrating its capacity to support complex urban change analysis tasks with real-world policy implications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic paradigm to address uncertainty in ground truth answers for AI benchmarking, emphasizing the need for high certainty to accurately compare expert and non-expert performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the misleading conclusions drawn when ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data, especially in fields like medicine where ambiguity is common.

Method: Proposes expected accuracy and expected F1 scores to account for ground truth variability and recommends stratifying results by ground truth probability.

Result: Shows that ignoring uncertainty can falsely equate non-expert performance with experts and that stratification improves reliability.

Conclusion: Recommends stratifying evaluations by ground truth certainty, particularly when performance is below 80%, to ensure accurate comparisons.

Abstract: Benchmarking the relative capabilities of AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models, typically ignores the impact of uncertainty in the underlying ground truth answers from experts. This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.
  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how combining explainable AI (XAI) with causal reasoning can enhance human-AI collaboration by making AI's internal representations transparent, aiding discovery, optimization, and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite AI's superior performance in tasks, its opacity limits trust and collaboration. The authors aim to bridge this gap using XAI and causal reasoning.

Method: They propose integrating foundation models (large-scale AI models) with explainability methods to extract causal mechanisms and ensure robust design.

Result: This approach supports discovery, optimization, and certification in high-stakes applications, fostering trust and accountability.

Conclusion: XAI serves as a unifying framework for human-AI collaboration, though challenges like faithfulness and usability of explanations remain.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence now outperforms humans in several scientific and engineering tasks, yet its internal representations often remain opaque. In this Perspective, we argue that explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), combined with causal reasoning, enables {\it learning from the learners}. Focusing on discovery, optimization and certification, we show how the combination of foundation models and explainability methods allows the extraction of causal mechanisms, guides robust design and control, and supports trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We discuss challenges in faithfulness, generalization and usability of explanations, and propose XAI as a unifying framework for human-AI collaboration in science and engineering.

*Jua Han,Jaeyoon Seo,Jungbin Min,Jean Oh,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs in safety-critical scenarios like fire evacuations, revealing severe vulnerabilities and concluding they aren't yet safe for direct deployment due to catastrophic risks from minor errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to systematically assess LLM performance in safety-critical settings where errors can endanger lives, given their growing role in robotics decision-making.

Method: Qualitative evaluation of fire evacuation scenarios identified failures, leading to quantitative tasks (Complete Information, Incomplete Information, SOSR) benchmarking LLMs/VLMs.

Result: Models showed critical flaws: 0% success in ASCII navigation, hazardous instructions in fire drills, and risks from a 1% failure rate amplifying catastrophic outcomes.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are unsafe for direct deployment in safety-critical systems, as even state-of-the-art models can’t guarantee safety, and minor errors lead to unacceptable risks.

Abstract: One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.

TL;DR: WildSci introduces a dataset of domain-specific science questions synthesized from literature to improve LLM reasoning in scientific domains using multiple-choice tasks and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in LLM reasoning lags in scientific domains due to limited data and complexity of questions. WildSci aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The dataset covers 9 disciplines and 26 subdomains, framing tasks as multiple-choice for scalable training. Reinforcement learning is used for finetuning.

Result: Experiments show effectiveness on scientific benchmarks. Domain-specific performance and generalization trends are analyzed.

Conclusion: WildSci enables scalable research in scientific reasoning and is publicly available.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning has focused on domains like mathematics and coding, where abundant high-quality data and objective evaluation metrics are readily available. In contrast, progress in LLM reasoning models remains limited in scientific domains such as medicine and materials science due to limited dataset coverage and the inherent complexity of open-ended scientific questions. To address these challenges, we introduce WildSci, a new dataset of domain-specific science questions automatically synthesized from peer-reviewed literature, covering 9 scientific disciplines and 26 subdomains. By framing complex scientific reasoning tasks in a multiple-choice format, we enable scalable training with well-defined reward signals. We further apply reinforcement learning to finetune models on these data and analyze the resulting training dynamics, including domain-specific performance changes, response behaviors, and generalization trends. Experiments on a suite of scientific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and approach. We release WildSci to enable scalable and sustainable research in scientific reasoning, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/JustinTX/WildSci.

TL;DR: Proposing RL-based post-training of lightweight LLMs for fraud detection in e-commerce, achieving improved F1-scores by exploring novel fraud indicators in raw transaction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unexploited potential of LLMs in real-world fraud detection due to lack of empirical validation and domain-specific challenges.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) with GSPO algorithm and rule-based rewards to fine-tune LLMs on raw transaction data.

Result: Post-trained models show significant F1-score improvements by uncovering novel fraud indicators beyond traditional features.

Conclusion: RL enhances LLMs' fraud detection capabilities by leveraging exploration mechanisms for better performance.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms and payment solution providers face increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, ranging from identity theft and account takeovers to complex money laundering operations that exploit the speed and anonymity of digital transactions. However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.

### [183] [A Causal Information-Flow Framework for Unbiased Learning-to-Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05590)
*Haoming Gong,Qingyao Ai,Zhihao Tao,Yongfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a causal learning-based ranking framework to address biases in click data for ranking models, combining Structural Causal Models with information-theoretic tools to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ULTR methods fail to fully address biases in click data or handle multiple bias sources, limiting their effectiveness in learning true relevance.

Method: The framework uses Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to identify relevance from clicks and conditional mutual information to measure bias leakage, integrating these with a doubly robust estimator.

Result: Experiments show the method reduces bias leakage and enhances ranking performance, particularly when multiple biases interact.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses multiple biases in click data, improving ranking model accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: In web search and recommendation systems, user clicks are widely used to train ranking models. However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the
  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CPSR improves inductive KGC by masking noise and capturing path-level semantics, achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inductive KGC methods struggle with noisy structures and long-range dependencies, prompting the need for CPSR.

Method: CPSR uses query-dependent masking and global semantic scoring to optimize structural and semantic information.

Result: CPSR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CPSR effectively addresses noise and dependency issues in inductive KGC, enhancing dynamic adaptability.

Abstract: Conventional Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods aim to infer missing information in incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing information, which struggle to perform effectively in scenarios involving emerging entities. Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper explores whether generative models are truly controllable, proposing a theoretical framework and algorithm to estimate controllable sets in dialogue settings, with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative models become widespread, understanding their controllability is critical. Existing methods lack theoretical grounding, prompting this study.

Method: The authors frame human-model interaction as a control process and introduce an algorithm to estimate controllable sets. They provide formal guarantees on estimation error.

Result: Empirical tests reveal that controllability is fragile and context-dependent, underscoring the need for rigorous analysis.

Conclusion: The study shifts focus from control attempts to understanding fundamental limits of controllability, advocating for deeper analysis.

Abstract: As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.

TL;DR: HAG is a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework addressing limitations in agent initialization for Agent-Based Modeling by combining macro-level distribution alignment with micro-level consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either lack adaptability to unseen topics or fail to align macro-level distributions with micro-level rationality, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: HAG formalizes population generation as a two-stage process: hierarchical conditional probability inference via a World Knowledge Model, followed by micro-level instantiation and augmentation using real-world data.

Result: HAG reduces population alignment errors by 37.7% and improves sociological consistency by 18.8% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: HAG effectively bridges the gap between macro-level distribution alignment and micro-level rationality, offering a superior framework for agent initialization.

Abstract: High-fidelity agent initialization is crucial for credible Agent-Based Modeling across diverse domains. A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework. Extensive experiments show that HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CHDP, a framework for efficiently modeling hybrid action spaces by treating them as cooperative games, outperforming existing methods by up to 19.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid action spaces combine discrete and continuous parameters, posing challenges in modeling and optimization. Limited policy expressiveness and scalability issues in high-dimensional settings drive the need for a solution.

Method: CHDP uses two cooperative agents with discrete and continuous diffusion policies. The continuous policy depends on the discrete action's representation, and sequential updates minimize conflicts. A codebook embeds high-dimensional discrete actions into a low-dimensional space, aided by Q-function guidance.

Result: CHDP achieves up to 19.3% higher success rates than state-of-the-art methods on hybrid action benchmarks.

Conclusion: The cooperative framework CHDP effectively addresses hybrid action space challenges, improving scalability and performance.

Abstract: Hybrid action space, which combines discrete choices and continuous parameters, is prevalent in domains such as robot control and game AI. However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training. On challenging hybrid action benchmarks, CHDP outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to $19.3\%$ in success rate.

TL;DR: Circular Reasoning in LRMs causes repetitive loops, analyzed via LoopBench and addressed using CUSUM for early prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational waste and inference failure caused by repetitive loops in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).

Method: Introduce LoopBench dataset to study loop typologies, characterize circular reasoning mechanics, and apply CUSUM algorithm for early loop prediction.

Result: CUSUM accurately predicts loops, enhancing long-chain reasoning stability in LRMs.

Conclusion: Circular Reasoning is a distinct failure mode in LRMs, and early detection via CUSUM improves model performance.

Abstract: Despite the success of test-time scaling, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) frequently encounter repetitive loops that lead to computational waste and inference failure. In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction. Experiments across diverse LRMs validate its accuracy and elucidate the stability of long-chain reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Combining LLMs and TPs for verifiable NLI lacks adaptability due to fixed logical formalisms. A logic-parametric framework embeds diverse logics into HOL, improving performance and efficiency, with domain-dependent logic effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neuro-symbolic NLI approaches are limited by fixed logical formalisms, reducing robustness and adaptability. The study aims to address this by making logic a controllable component.

Method: A logic-parametric framework is proposed, embedding classical and non-classical formalisms into HOL using LogiKEy. The study compares logic-external (axioms) and logic-internal (built-in structure) approaches for normative reasoning.

Result: Logic-internal strategies improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs. First-order logic suits commonsense reasoning, while deontic/modal logics excel in ethical domains. Logic choice is domain-dependent.

Conclusion: Making logic a parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures enhances robustness, modularity, and adaptability, with domain-specific logic choices improving NLI performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and theorem provers (TPs) can be effectively combined for verifiable natural language inference (NLI). However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.

Conclusion: HSD is a highly effective, explainable, and generalizable solution for speculative decoding, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency without compromising fidelity.

Abstract: Verification is a key bottleneck in improving inference speed while maintaining distribution fidelity in Speculative Decoding. Recent work has shown that sequence-level verification leads to a higher number of accepted tokens compared to token-wise verification. However, existing solutions often rely on surrogate approximations or are constrained by partial information, struggling with joint intractability. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks. Moreover, its strong explainability and generality make it readily integrable into a wide range of speculative decoding frameworks. Notably, integrating HSD into EAGLE-3 yields over a 12% performance gain, establishing state-of-the-art decoding efficiency without compromising distribution fidelity.

### [191] [PII-VisBench: Evaluating Personally Identifiable Information Safety in Vision Language Models Along a Continuum of Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05739)
*G M Shahariar,Zabir Al Nazi,Md Olid Hasan Bhuiyan,Zhouxing Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PII-VisBench introduces a benchmark for evaluating VLM safety across varying online presence levels, revealing higher PII disclosure for high-visibility subjects and model vulnerabilities to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations overlook the impact of a subject's online presence on PII leakage, motivating the need for visibility-aware safety assessments.

Method: PII-VisBench uses 4000 probes across 200 subjects stratified by online visibility (high to zero) to evaluate 18 VLMs via refusal and disclosure rates.

Result: Refusals rise and PII disclosures drop (9.10% high to 5.34% low) with lower visibility; high-visibility subjects and certain models disclose more PII.

Conclusion: Visibility significantly affects PII leakage, highlighting the need for tailored safety evaluations and training to mitigate model vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.

### [192] [DynaDebate: Breaking Homogeneity in Multi-Agent Debate with Dynamic Path Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05746)
*Zhenghao Li,Zhi Zheng,Wei Chen,Jielun Zhao,Yong Chen,Tong Xu,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DynaDebate improves multi-agent debate effectiveness by introducing dynamic path generation, process-centric debate, and trigger-based verification, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multi-Agent Debate frameworks suffer from unguided initialization, leading to identical reasoning paths and errors, which hinders effective debate and reduces outcomes to simple majority voting.

Method: DynaDebate introduces three mechanisms: Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation for diverse solution paths, Process-Centric Debate focusing on logic critique, and a Trigger-Based Verification Agent to resolve deadlocks.

Result: Extensive experiments show DynaDebate outperforms state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Debate methods across benchmarks.

Conclusion: DynaDebate enhances multi-agent collaboration and reasoning by addressing limitations in current debate frameworks, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which excel at collaborative decision-making and complex problem-solving. Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.

### [193] [From Off-Policy to On-Policy: Enhancing GUI Agents via Bi-level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05787)
*Zezhou Wang,Ziyun Zhang,Xiaoyi Zhang,Zhuzhong Qian,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BEPA improves end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies by leveraging expert trajectories through bi-level assimilation, achieving significant performance gains on GUI benchmarks like OSWorld-Verified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end screenshot-to-action policies lag behind framework-based systems due to limited GUI datasets and scaling challenges with expert trajectories. RLVR aims to exploit small expert datasets effectively.

Method: Proposes BEPA, which aligns expert traces with policy learning via self-rolled reachable trajectories (LEVEL-1) and a dynamic cache for RLVR (LEVEL-2).

Result: BEPA improves success rates on OSWorld-Verified (22.87% to 32.13%) and other benchmarks like MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

Conclusion: BEPA effectively bridges the gap between expert trajectories and policy learning, enhancing performance of end-to-end GUI interaction models.

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents (CUAs) that operate desktops and browsers. Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

*Ruizhe Zhang,Xinke Jiang,Zhibang Yang,Zhixin Zhang,Jiaran Gao,Yuzhen Xiao,Hongbin Lai,Xu Chu,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StackPlanner is a hierarchical multi-agent framework designed to improve memory management and coordination in complex tasks, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized multi-agent systems struggle with memory inefficiency and poor cross-task generalization due to context bloat and error accumulation.

Method: StackPlanner decouples high-level coordination from subtask execution, uses active memory control, and leverages structured experience memory with reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments show StackPlanner enhances long-horizon collaboration in multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: StackPlanner effectively addresses memory and coordination challenges in complex tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems based on large language models, particularly centralized architectures, have recently shown strong potential for complex and knowledge-intensive tasks. However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.

### [195] [TowerMind: A Tower Defence Game Learning Environment and Benchmark for LLM as Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05899)
*Dawei Wang,Chengming Zhou,Di Zhao,Xinyuan Liu,Marci Chi Ma,Gary Ushaw,Richard Davison*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TowerMind is a lightweight, multimodal RTS game environment designed to evaluate LLMs' planning, decision-making, and hallucination, revealing performance gaps between LLMs and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RTS environments are computationally demanding or lack textual observation support, limiting LLM evaluation.

Method: Developed TowerMind, a tower defense-based RTS environment with multimodal observations (pixel, text, structured) and customizable benchmarks.

Result: LLMs lagged behind human experts in planning, decision-making, and hallucination, showing limitations like inadequate planning validation.

Conclusion: TowerMind complements RTS environments, offering a new benchmark for AI agent evaluation.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

### [196] [Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05991)
*Jiayu Ding,Haoran Tang,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a task to detect ambiguous commands in 3D scenes, and presents Ambi3D, a large benchmark, and AmbiVer, a solution framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linguistic ambiguity in safety-critical domains can lead to severe errors, but most embodied AI research ignores this, focusing only on execution. The paper addresses this gap.

Method: Defines a new task and builds Ambi3D, a benchmark with 700+ scenes and 22k instructions. Proposes AmbiVer, a two-stage framework using visual evidence and VLM for ambiguity detection.

Result: State-of-the-art 3D LLMs struggle with ambiguity detection. AmbiVer effectively addresses this challenge, as shown by experiments.

Conclusion: The work advances safer embodied AI by tackling instruction ambiguity, demonstrated by AmbiVer's effectiveness and the release of Ambi3D.

Abstract: In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.
