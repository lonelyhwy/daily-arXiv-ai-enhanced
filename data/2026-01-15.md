### [1] [Reading or Reasoning? Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning for Document OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08834)
*Yufeng Zhong,Lei Chen,Zhixiong Zeng,Xuanle Zhao,Deyang Jiang,Liming Zheng,Jing Huang,Haibo Qiu,Peng Shi,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Advanced OCR models face high entropy in formatted text. FD-RL, a format decoupled reinforcement learning approach, improves performance by targeting high-entropy patterns and achieves a record score on OmniDocBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the higher entropy and output uncertainty in OCR models when processing formatted text (e.g., formulas, tables) compared to plain text.

Method: Proposes Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning (FD-RL), using entropy-based data filtration and format decoupled rewards for targeted optimization.

Result: FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this benchmark.

Conclusion: FD-RL effectively addresses the challenges of high entropy in formatted text, validated through comprehensive ablation studies.

Abstract: Reading text from images or scanned documents via OCR models has been a longstanding focus of researchers. Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark. More importantly, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies over data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies, thoroughly validating their effectiveness.

### [2] [Bias Detection and Rotation-Robustness Mitigation in Vision-Language Models and Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08860)
*Tarannum Mithila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores bias and robustness issues in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and generative image models under input transformations like rotation and distributional shifts. It proposes mitigation strategies to enhance robustness and fairness without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the unexplored robustness and fairness of VLMs and generative models under input transformations, particularly image rotation and distributional shifts.

Method: The authors analyze bias propagation and robustness degradation in these models and propose mitigation strategies involving data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in robustness and reductions in bias amplification across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The research highlights limitations in current multimodal systems and offers practical techniques to develop more reliable and fair AI models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and generative image models have achieved remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their robustness and fairness under input transformations remain insufficiently explored. This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance. This study highlights critical limitations of current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models.

### [3] [R$^2$BD: A Reconstruction-Based Method for Generalizable and Efficient Detection of Fake Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08867)
*Qingyu Liu,Zhongjie Ba,Jianmin Guo,Qiu Wang,Zhibo Wang,Jie Shi,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R²BD is a novel fake image detection framework that improves efficiency and generalization by using a unified reconstruction model (G-LDM) and a single-step residual bias calculation, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and limited generalization of existing reconstruction-based fake image detection methods, which rely heavily on diffusion models and multi-step processes.

Method: R²BD combines G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model simulating VAE, GAN, and diffusion behaviors, and a residual bias module for single-step detection.

Result: R²BD is 22x faster than existing methods and achieves superior accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 13.87% in cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: R²BD offers significant improvements in efficiency and generalization for fake image detection across diverse generative methods.

Abstract: Recently, reconstruction-based methods have gained attention for AIGC image detection. These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.
  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87\%, showing strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods. The code and dataset used for evaluation are available at https://github.com/QingyuLiu/RRBD.

### [4] [Residual Cross-Modal Fusion Networks for Audio-Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08868)
*Yi Wang,Yinfeng Yu,Bin Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Audio-visual navigation agents use sound cues in 3D environments; CRFN improves fusion via bidirectional residuals, enhancing performance and cross-domain adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task requires effective multimodal fusion to avoid dominance or degradation of single-modality features, especially in cross-domain scenarios.

Method: Proposes Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network (CRFN) with bidirectional residual interactions for complementary modeling and alignment.

Result: CRFN outperforms baselines on Replica and Matterport3D datasets and shows stronger cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: CRFN enhances multimodal fusion and reveals differentiated modality dependence across datasets, offering insights into cross-modal collaboration.

Abstract: Audio-visual embodied navigation aims to enable an agent to autonomously localize and reach a sound source in unseen 3D environments by leveraging auditory cues. The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, our experiments also reveal that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets. The discovery of this phenomenon provides a new perspective for understanding the cross-modal collaboration mechanism of embodied agents.

### [5] [ForensicFormer: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Reasoning for Cross-Domain Image Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08873)
*Hema Hariharan Samson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForensicFormer is a hierarchical multi-scale framework for cross-domain forgery detection, outperforming traditional methods with 86.8% accuracy and robustness to JPEG compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forensic methods are ineffective against AI-generated imagery and sophisticated editing tools, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: ForensicFormer uses a hierarchical approach combining low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers.

Result: The method achieves 86.8% accuracy across diverse datasets, outperforming baselines (66% accuracy at Q=70 JPEG compression) and provides pixel-level localization with a 0.76 F1-score.

Conclusion: ForensicFormer bridges classical forensics and deep learning, offering a practical solution for detecting unknown manipulations.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated imagery and sophisticated editing tools has rendered traditional forensic methods ineffective for cross-domain forgery detection. We present ForensicFormer, a hierarchical multi-scale framework that unifies low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers. Unlike prior single-paradigm approaches, which achieve <75% accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, our method maintains 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets, spanning traditional manipulations, GAN-generated images, and diffusion model outputs - a significant improvement over state-of-the-art universal detectors. We demonstrate superior robustness to JPEG compression (83% accuracy at Q=70 vs. 66% for baselines) and provide pixel-level forgery localization with a 0.76 F1-score. Extensive ablation studies validate that each hierarchical component contributes 4-10% accuracy improvement, and qualitative analysis reveals interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning. Our work bridges classical image forensics and modern deep learning, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment where manipulation techniques are unknown a priori.

### [6] [Learning Domain-Invariant Representations for Cross-Domain Image Registration via Scene-Appearance Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08875)
*Jiahao Qin,Yiwen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAR-Net proposes a scene-appearance disentanglement framework to tackle domain shift in image registration, achieving significant improvements in performance metrics like SSIM and NCC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of image registration under domain shift, where conventional methods fail due to systematic intensity differences between source and target images.

Method: SAR-Net decomposes images into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. Theoretical conditions are established for consistent cross-domain alignment.

Result: The method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, outperforming baselines by 3.1x, with real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies highlight the necessity of scene consistency and domain alignment losses.

Conclusion: SAR-Net effectively resolves domain shift challenges in image registration through principled scene-appearance disentanglement, validated by strong empirical results.

Abstract: Image registration under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and medical imaging: when source and target images exhibit systematic intensity differences, the brightness constancy assumption underlying conventional registration methods is violated, rendering correspondence estimation ill-posed. We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively. Code and data are available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAR-NET.

### [7] [The Semantic Lifecycle in Embodied AI: Acquisition, Representation and Storage via Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08876)
*Shuai Chen,Hao Chen,Yuanchen Bei,Tianyang Zhao,Zhibo Zhou,Feiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Semantic Lifecycle framework to unify the evolution of semantic knowledge in embodied AI, driven by foundation models, addressing challenges in multi-source, multi-stage semantic processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of leveraging multi-source, multi-stage semantic information in embodied AI for stable perception-to-action loops in complex environments.

Method: Proposes the Semantic Lifecycle framework, analyzing semantic knowledge evolution through acquisition, representation, and storage stages.

Result: Highlights recent advances in foundation models and provides a holistic perspective on semantic knowledge flow.

Conclusion: Summarizes challenges and outlines future research directions for improving semantic processing in embodied AI.

Abstract: Semantic information in embodied AI is inherently multi-source and multi-stage, making it challenging to fully leverage for achieving stable perception-to-action loops in real-world environments. Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage. Finally, we summarize existing challenges and outline promising directions for future research.

### [8] [TAG-MoE: Task-Aware Gating for Unified Generative Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08881)
*Yu Xu,Hongbin Yan,Juan Cao,Yiji Cheng,Tiankai Hang,Runze He,Zijin Yin,Shiyi Zhang,Yuxin Zhang,Jintao Li,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu,Tong-Yee Lee,Fan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework injects semantic intent into Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing to mitigate task interference in unified image generation and editing models, improving fidelity and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dense diffusion transformers architectures suffer from task interference due to conflicting objectives, and task-agnostic MoE gating networks fail to resolve this issue.

Method: Introduces Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation for structured task descriptors and Predictive Alignment Regularization to align routing decisions with task semantics.

Result: The model outperforms dense baselines in fidelity and quality, with experts developing semantically correlated specializations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully mitigates task interference by evolving the gating network into a semantic-aware dispatch center.

Abstract: Unified image generation and editing models suffer from severe task interference in dense diffusion transformers architectures, where a shared parameter space must compromise between conflicting objectives (e.g., local editing v.s. subject-driven generation). While the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm is a promising solution, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating based on local features, unaware of global task intent. This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation). We then design Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with the task's high-level semantics. This regularization evolves the gating network from a task-agnostic executor to a dispatch center. Our model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality, and our analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.

*Thomas Snyder,H. Lexie Yang,Stefan Schnake,Steffen Schotthöfer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using DLRT to compress large geospatial foundation models for edge devices, achieving high compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable deployment of geospatial foundation models on resource-constrained edge devices by addressing their large parameter size and compression-induced accuracy loss.

Method: Utilizes the DLRT manifold-constrained optimization framework to compress vision transformer-based models during transfer learning, enforcing structured low-dimensional parameterizations.

Result: Outperforms existing low-rank methods like LoRA, achieving significant parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach enables high-performing on-device geospatial models by effectively balancing compression and accuracy.

Abstract: Deploying geospatial foundation models on resource-constrained edge devices demands compact architectures that maintain high downstream performance. However, their large parameter counts and the accuracy loss often induced by compression limit practical adoption. In this work, we leverage manifold-constrained optimization framework DLRT to compress large vision transformer-based geospatial foundation models during transfer learning. By enforcing structured low-dimensional parameterizations aligned with downstream objectives, this approach achieves strong compression while preserving task-specific accuracy. We show that the method outperforms of-the-shelf low-rank methods as LoRA. Experiments on diverse geospatial benchmarks confirm substantial parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss, enabling high-performing, on-device geospatial models.

### [10] [Adaptive few-shot learning for robust part quality classification in two-photon lithography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08885)
*Sixian Jia,Ruo-Syuan Mei,Chenhui Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive CV framework for quality control in TPL, featuring novelty detection, few-shot incremental learning, and domain adaptation, achieving high accuracy with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CV models for quality control in TPL are static and fail in dynamic environments, unable to detect new defects or adapt to new geometries efficiently.

Method: The framework uses LDA-based hypothesis testing for novelty detection, rehearsal-based incremental learning for few-shot updates, and few-shot DANN for domain adaptation.

Result: Achieved 99-100% novelty detection accuracy, 92% incremental learning accuracy with 20 samples, and 96.19% domain adaptation accuracy with 5 shots.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, data-efficient solution for maintaining CV models in evolving TPL production environments.

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is an advanced additive manufacturing (AM) technique for fabricating high-precision micro-structures. While computer vision (CV) is proofed for automated quality control, existing models are often static, rendering them ineffective in dynamic manufacturing environments. These models typically cannot detect new, unseen defect classes, be efficiently updated from scarce data, or adapt to new part geometries. To address this gap, this paper presents an adaptive CV framework for the entire life-cycle of quality model maintenance. The proposed framework is built upon a same, scale-robust backbone model and integrates three key methodologies: (1) a statistical hypothesis testing framework based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for novelty detection, (2) a two-stage, rehearsal-based strategy for few-shot incremental learning, and (3) a few-shot Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for few-shot domain adaptation. The framework was evaluated on a TPL dataset featuring hemisphere as source domain and cube as target domain structures, with each domain categorized into good, minor damaged, and damaged quality classes. The hypothesis testing method successfully identified new class batches with 99-100% accuracy. The incremental learning method integrated a new class to 92% accuracy using only K=20 samples. The domain adaptation model bridged the severe domain gap, achieving 96.19% accuracy on the target domain using only K=5 shots. These results demonstrate a robust and data-efficient solution for deploying and maintaining CV models in evolving production scenarios.

*Satyaki Roy Chowdhury,Golrokh Mirzaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAMSA-UNet, a Bayesian U-Net variant with multi-scale attention and uncertainty-aware smoothing, outperforms U-Net in brain tumor segmentation, improving Dice and IoU while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and U-Net approaches struggle with noisy boundaries in tumor segmentation, prompting the need for a method that combines detailed feature capture with spatial coherence.

Method: UAMSA-UNet integrates Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty-aware predictions, multi-scale feature fusion, and attention maps, augmented by a smoothing-regularized loss to penalize variance and ensure coherent masks.

Result: On BraTS2023 and BraTS2024 datasets, UAMSA-UNet achieves up to 3.3% Dice and 2.7% IoU improvements over U-Net, and reduces FLOPs by 42.5% compared to U-Net++.

Conclusion: UAMSA-UNet enhances segmentation quality and efficiency by combining multi-scale attention with learned smoothing, offering a flexible foundation for future enhancements.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet many CNN and U-Net based approaches produce noisy boundaries in regions of tumor infiltration. We introduce UAMSA-UNet, an Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Scale Attention-based Bayesian U-Net that in- stead leverages Monte Carlo Dropout to learn a data-driven smoothing prior over its predictions, while fusing multi-scale features and attention maps to capture both fine details and global context. Our smoothing-regularized loss augments binary cross-entropy with a variance penalty across stochas- tic forward passes, discouraging spurious fluctuations and yielding spatially coherent masks. On BraTS2023, UAMSA- UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient by up to 3.3% and mean IoU by up to 2.7% over U-Net; on BraTS2024, it delivers up to 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over the best baseline. Remarkably, it also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% rel- ative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy. These results demonstrate that, by combining multi-scale attention with a learned smoothing prior, UAMSA-UNet achieves both better segmentation quality and computational efficiency, and provides a flexible foundation for future integration with transformer-based modules for further enhanced segmenta- tion results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Thermo-LIO combines thermal imaging and LiDAR for improved structural health monitoring, outperforming traditional methods in detecting defects and thermal anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional thermography lacks effectiveness in assessing complex geometries and subsurface defects, motivating the development of a multimodal fusion system.

Method: The study develops a fusion method for thermal imaging and LiDAR, integrates it with LIO for large-scale coverage, and validates it through case studies.

Result: Experiments show Thermo-LIO detects thermal anomalies and defects more accurately and enables real-time processing and broader inspection coverage.

Conclusion: Thermo-LIO highlights the importance of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM for large-scale civil infrastructure.

Abstract: Traditional two-dimensional thermography, despite being non-invasive and useful for defect detection in the construction field, is limited in effectively assessing complex geometries, inaccessible areas, and subsurface defects. This paper introduces Thermo-LIO, a novel multi-sensor system that can enhance Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by fusing thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR. To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods. The system enhances diagnostic precision, enables real-time processing, and expands inspection coverage, highlighting the crucial role of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM methodologies for large-scale civil infrastructure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM 2.1 is adapted for pose-guided segmentation with PoseMaskRefine, improving robustness under occlusion by using high-visibility keypoints and simplifying prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance SAM's segmentation performance under occlusion by leveraging pose keypoints while maintaining generalization.

Method: Fine-tuned SAM 2.1 with PoseMaskRefine, incorporating high-visibility keypoints into SAM's iterative correction process and simplifying prompts during inference.

Result: Improved robustness and accuracy across datasets, with accurate mask prediction from minimal keypoints.

Conclusion: Pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables occlusion-aware human segmentation without compromising generalization.

Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) provides an unprecedented foundation for human segmentation, but may struggle under occlusion, where keypoints may be partially or fully invisible. We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model. The code and pretrained models will be available at https://mirapurkrabek.github.io/BBox-MaskPose.

### [14] [Instance camera focus prediction for crystal agglomeration classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09004)
*Xiaoyu Ji,Chenhao Zhang,Tyler James Downard,Zoltan Nagy,Ali Shakouri,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method combining camera focus prediction and instance segmentation improves agglomeration classification accuracy by addressing depth-related ambiguities in microscopic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in accurately classifying crystal agglomeration from 2D microscopic images, where overlapping crystals at different depths can falsely appear connected due to the shallow depth of field of optical microscopes.

Method: The approach involves using a camera focus prediction network to quantify focus levels (in-focus/out-of-focus) and integrating this with an instance segmentation model for agglomeration classification.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline models in agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy on datasets of ammonium perchlorate and sugar crystals.

Conclusion: Combining focus prediction with instance segmentation effectively addresses depth-related ambiguities in microscopic images, enhancing agglomeration analysis.

Abstract: Agglomeration refers to the process of crystal clustering due to interparticle forces. Crystal agglomeration analysis from microscopic images is challenging due to the inherent limitations of two-dimensional imaging. Overlapping crystals may appear connected even when located at different depth layers. Because optical microscopes have a shallow depth of field, crystals that are in-focus and out-of-focus in the same image typically reside on different depth layers and do not constitute true agglomeration. To address this, we first quantified camera focus with an instance camera focus prediction network to predict 2 class focus level that aligns better with visual observations than traditional image processing focus measures. Then an instance segmentation model is combined with the predicted focus level for agglomeration classification. Our proposed method has a higher agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy than the baseline models on ammonium perchlorate crystal and sugar crystal dataset.

### [15] [Depth-Wise Representation Development Under Blockwise Self-Supervised Learning for Video Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09040)
*Jonas Römer,Timo Dickscheid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores training masked video transformers without end-to-end backpropagation using blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), achieving comparable results to traditional methods while revealing differences in learning dynamics and representation development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether masked video transformers can be trained effectively without end-to-end backpropagation, addressing gaps in understanding BWSSL's handling of spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure.

Method: Partitioning the encoder into blocks, each optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss, and analyzing intermediate representations through depth-wise decodability and patch-level diagnostics.

Result: Blockwise training converges and achieves performance close to end-to-end baselines, with earlier exposure of higher-level structure and late-block saturation.

Conclusion: BWSSL offers a viable alternative to end-to-end training, though late-block saturation and interface formation remain areas for improvement.

Abstract: End-to-end backpropagation couples all layers through a global error signal, enabling coordinated learning but requiring long-range credit assignment. Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.

### [16] [Exploring Reliable Spatiotemporal Dependencies for Efficient Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09078)
*Junze Shi,Yang Yu,Jian Shi,Haibo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STDTrack improves lightweight object tracking by integrating spatiotemporal dependencies and dense sampling, achieving high performance and real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight trackers use sparse sampling, limiting spatiotemporal information exploration and creating a performance gap with high-performance trackers.

Method: STDTrack employs dense video sampling, a spatiotemporal token, a Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), and a multi-scale prediction head.

Result: STDTrack achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks, matching high-performance trackers while running at 192 FPS (GPU) and 41 FPS (CPU).

Conclusion: STDTrack bridges the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers by leveraging spatiotemporal dependencies and dense sampling, maintaining real-time efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based lightweight object tracking have established new standards across benchmarks, leveraging the global receptive field and powerful feature extraction capabilities of attention mechanisms. Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. Notably, on GOT-10k, STDTrack rivals certain high-performance non-real-time trackers (e.g., MixFormer) while operating at 192 FPS(GPU) and 41 FPS(CPU).

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning method for localizing rovers in aerial maps using cross-view networks, synthetic data, and semantic segmentation to address scarce real-space data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance planetary robotics autonomy by addressing the scarcity of real-space data for accurate localization.

Method: Uses cross-view-localizing dual-encoder neural networks, semantic segmentation with vision models, and synthetic data to bridge domain gaps.

Result: Develops accurate position estimation over trajectories using particle filters with cross-view networks.

Conclusion: The proposed method leverages synthetic data and semantic segmentation to achieve accurate rover localization in aerial maps.

Abstract: Accurate localisation in planetary robotics enables the advanced autonomy required to support the increased scale and scope of future missions. The successes of the Ingenuity helicopter and multiple planetary orbiters lay the groundwork for future missions that use ground-aerial robotic teams. In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks. We leverage semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high volume synthetic data to bridge the domain gap to real images. We also contribute a new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with corresponding ground-truth localisation data captured in a planetary analogue facility, plus a high volume dataset of analogous synthetic image pairs. Using particle filters for state estimation with the cross-view networks allows accurate position estimation over simple and complex trajectories based on sequences of ground-view images.

*Yanguang Sun,Chao Wang,Jian Yang,Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WEFT, a dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm for efficiently adapting large-scale foundation models to optical remote sensing image (ORSI) segmentation tasks with fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on moderate-scale pre-trained models and full-parameter fine-tuning, which is inefficient for large-scale models due to high computational costs and GPU memory consumption. WEFT aims to address these challenges.

Method: WEFT uses a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model and dynamically regulate wavelet experts, generating task-specific features. It also employs an expert-guided conditional adapter to iteratively update features for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: WEFT outperforms 21 state-of-the-art methods on three ORSIs datasets and achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed WEFT paradigm effectively addresses the challenges of fine-tuning large-scale models for ORSI segmentation, offering superior performance with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting relevant objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) is critical for advancing remote sensing applications. Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-Aug leverages SAM's geometry-aware segmentation for few-shot remote sensing, improving land cover mapping without extra labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of few-shot semantic segmentation in remote sensing where labeled data is scarce or costly.

Method: Uses SAM-derived geometry-aware mask priors and a new loss function (RegionSmoothLoss) for training consistency across temporal frames.

Result: Achieves 36.21% mIoU (2.33pp better than baseline) and up to 40.28% mIoU on favorable splits, showing consistent improvement.

Conclusion: SAM-Aug demonstrates that foundation models like SAM can effectively regularize few-shot learning, offering scalable solutions without manual annotations.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation of time-series remote sensing images remains a critical challenge, particularly in regions where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain. While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces slow4fast-VLN, a framework combining fast and slow reasoning to enhance generalization in Vision-Language Navigation tasks for unseen environments and instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VLN methods struggle with unseen scenarios due to close-set assumptions. Inspired by human cognition, the authors aim to improve generalization by dynamically adapting strategies.

Method: The slow4fast-VLN framework involves a fast-reasoning module for real-time action generation and a slow-reasoning module that analyzes execution records to refine strategies. Both modules interact dynamically.

Result: The framework enables continuous adaptation and efficient navigation in unseen environments by leveraging slow-reasoning insights to optimize fast-reasoning actions.

Conclusion: slow4fast-VLN improves generalization in VLN tasks by mimicking human fast-slow cognition, offering a robust solution for open-world navigation challenges.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation aims to enable agents to navigate to a target location based on language instructions. Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios.

*Haoyan Gong,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal framework (Qwen3-VL) with Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM) for License Plate Recognition (LPR), outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address misalignment between restoration and recognition in LPR, and leverage VLMs' capabilities while adding structural priors for character sequences.

Method: Introduces CMRM with learnable Character Slot Queries for fine-grained evidence retrieval, combined with LoRA fine-tuning for domain adaptation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world degraded datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured reasoning into large models improves low-quality text recognition.

Abstract: Real-world License Plate Recognition (LPR) faces significant challenges from severe degradations such as motion blur, low resolution, and complex illumination. The prevailing "restoration-then-recognition" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current vision-based rail defect detection methods, such as high computational complexity and suboptimal accuracy.

Method: Uses MobileNetv2 for RGB feature extraction, a lightweight pyramid module for depth processing, a cross-attention mechanism for multimodal fusion, and a spatial feature extractor for structural analysis.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 9.90M parameters, 2.50 G FLOPs, and 162.60 fps, outperforming 18 baselines in metrics like Sα, IOU, and MAE.

Conclusion: LPCANet bridges traditional and deep learning approaches, offering practical value for defect inspection. Future work will focus on further compression for real-time deployment.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of current vision-based rail defect detection methods, including high computational complexity, excessive parameter counts, and suboptimal accuracy. We propose a Lightweight Pyramid Cross-Attention Network (LPCANet) that leverages RGB-D data for efficient and accurate defect identification. The architecture integrates MobileNetv2 as a backbone for RGB feature extraction with a lightweight pyramid module (LPM) for depth processing, coupled with a cross-attention mechanism (CAM) for multimodal fusion and a spatial feature extractor (SFE) for enhanced structural analysis. Comprehensive evaluations on three unsupervised RGB-D rail datasets (NEU-RSDDS-AUG, RSDD-TYPE1, RSDD-TYPE2) demonstrate that LPCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 9.90 million parameters, 2.50 G FLOPs, and 162.60 fps inference speed. Compared to 18 existing methods, LPCANet shows significant improvements, including +1.48\% in $S_α$, +0.86\% in IOU, and +1.77\% in MAE over the best-performing baseline. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of CAM and SFE, while experiments on non-rail datasets (DAGM2007, MT, Kolektor-SDD2) validate its generalization capability. The proposed framework effectively bridges traditional and deep learning approaches, offering substantial practical value for industrial defect inspection. Future work will focus on further model compression for real-time deployment.

TL;DR: CenterPolar is a novel SDG-DML framework addressing category and domain shifts by dynamically expanding and constraining domain distributions via centrifugal expansion and centripetal constraint phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing SDG-DML methods that generate clustered samples near class proxies, failing to simulate broad domain shifts.

Method: Proposes CenterPolar with two phases: Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion ($C^3E$) for domain generalization and Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint ($C^4$) for category generalization.

Result: Demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets like CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home.

Conclusion: CenterPolar effectively learns generalizable DML models for wider target domain distributions, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Single-domain generalized deep metric learning (SDG-DML) faces the dual challenge of both category and domain shifts during testing, limiting real-world applications. Therefore, aiming to learn better generalization ability on both unseen categories and domains is a realistic goal for the SDG-DML task. To deliver the aspiration, existing SDG-DML methods employ the domain expansion-equalization strategy to expand the source data and generate out-of-distribution samples. However, these methods rely on proxy-based expansion, which tends to generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in practice. To alleviate the problem, we propose CenterPolar, a novel SDG-DML framework that dynamically expands and constrains domain distributions to learn a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions. Specifically, \textbf{CenterPolar} contains two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: (1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion ($C^3E$) and (2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint ($C^4$). In the first phase, $C^3E$ drives the source domain distribution by shifting the source data away from class centroids using centrifugal expansion to generalize to more unseen domains. In the second phase, to consolidate domain-invariant class information for the generalization ability to unseen categories, $C^4$ pulls all seen and unseen samples toward their class centroids while enforcing inter-class separation via centripetal constraint. Extensive experimental results on widely used CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our CenterPolar over existing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released after acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkinFlow improves dermatology diagnosis by optimizing visual info flow with dynamic vision encoding and reinforcement learning, outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LVLMs struggle with diffuse attention in dermatology, needing better pathology-specific solutions without parameter scaling.

Method: SkinFlow uses a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder and two-stage RL to align explicit descriptions and reconstruct textures in constrained space.

Result: Achieves +12.06% Top-1 and +28.57% Top-6 accuracy gains on Fitzpatrick17k over larger models.

Conclusion: Optimizing geometric capacity and info flow is superior to parameter scaling for diagnostic precision.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), despite their massive scale, often falter in dermatology due to "diffuse attention" - the inability to disentangle subtle pathological lesions from background noise. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to "unfold" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2). These findings demonstrate that optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSAD methods are limited by single visual backbones, which fail to balance semantic generalization and fine-grained discriminability. SSVP aims to bridge this gap.

Method: SSVP introduces HSVS for multi-scale feature integration, VCPG for dynamic prompt generation, and VTAM for calibration. It leverages DINOv3 and CLIP.

Result: SSVP achieves 93.0% Image-AUROC and 92.2% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, significantly outperforming other zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: SSVP successfully enhances ZSAD by synergizing visual and semantic features, demonstrating robust performance across industrial benchmarks.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable supervision-free industrial inspection. However, existing ZSAD paradigms are constrained by single visual backbones, which struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability. To bridge this gap, we propose Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), that efficiently fuses diverse visual encodings to elevate model's fine-grained perception. Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm. Extensive evaluations on seven industrial benchmarks validate the robustness of our method; SSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 93.0\% Image-AUROC and 92.2\% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving deep learning robustness to natural corruptions, especially in safety-sensitive domains like traffic sign recognition.

Method: Used model-based training with learned nuisance variation models and hybrid strategies combining random coverage and adversarial refinement in nuisance space, evaluated on CURE-TSR dataset.

Result: Model-based methods consistently outperformed baselines; model-based adversarial training provided the strongest robustness but required higher computation, while model-based data augmentation offered comparable robustness with lower complexity.

Conclusion: Learned nuisance models are crucial for capturing natural variability, offering a path to more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Robustness to natural corruptions remains a critical challenge for reliable deep learning, particularly in safety-sensitive domains. We study a family of model-based training approaches that leverage a learned nuisance variation model to generate realistic corruptions, as well as new hybrid strategies that combine random coverage with adversarial refinement in nuisance space. Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance. These findings highlight the importance of learned nuisance models for capturing natural variability, and suggest a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions.

TL;DR: The study evaluates five GenAI text-to-image platforms for accuracy in generating architectural imagery, finding limited overall accuracy and identifying common errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of GenAI systems in accurately reproducing architectural imagery, given the field's rule-bound nature.

Method: Evaluated five platforms using 30 architectural prompts, producing 600 images scored by architectural historians for accuracy.

Result: Accuracy varied (32-52%), with Common prompts outperforming Rare ones. Platforms differed in failure rates.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for labeling AI-generated content, provenance standards, and cautious educational use.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) text-to-image systems are increasingly used to generate architectural imagery, yet their capacity to reproduce accurate images in a historically rule-bound field remains poorly characterized. We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.

TL;DR: N EIoU YOLOv9 is a lightweight detection framework using a novel loss function (N EIoU) for better bounding box regression, especially effective for small, low-contrast targets in agricultural disease imagery. It outperforms CIoU loss with a 4.3% mAP improvement and runs efficiently on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in detecting small and low-contrast agricultural disease targets, the paper introduces N EIoU to enhance weak regression signals and reduce gradient interference.

Method: N EIoU loss combines non-monotonic gradient focusing with geometric decoupling for improved bounding box regression. Integrated into YOLOv9t, tested on a rice leaf disease dataset.

Result: Achieves 90.3% mAP, a 4.3% improvement over CIoU, with stable inference on Android devices (156ms/frame).

Conclusion: N EIoU YOLOv9 effectively balances accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency for edge-based agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: In this work, we propose N EIoU YOLOv9, a lightweight detection framework based on a signal aware bounding box regression loss derived from non monotonic gradient focusing and geometric decoupling principles, referred to as N EIoU (Non monotonic Efficient Intersection over Union). The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge based agricultural monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to deploy accurate medical image segmentation models in on-premises clinical workflows, where computational resources are limited and cloud-based solutions may not be feasible due to governance and security constraints.

Method: Leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a family of compact student models, maintaining architectural compatibility with existing systems and enabling systematic capacity reduction.

Result: The distilled student model achieves a 94% parameter reduction while preserving 98.7% of the teacher model's accuracy and reduces CPU inference latency by up to 67%.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation offers a practical solution for adapting research-grade segmentation models into efficient, deployment-ready components for real-world clinical workflows.

Abstract: Deploying medical image segmentation models in routine clinical workflows is often constrained by on-premises infrastructure, where computational resources are fixed and cloud-based inference may be restricted by governance and security policies. While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is difficult due to low contrast, noise, and variability. Existing methods either ignore temporal information or suffer from error accumulation.

Method: Point-Seg integrates a point-tracking module trained on synthetic data to track landmarks, providing motion-aware signals for segmentation and avoiding memory-based feature accumulation. A temporal smoothing loss enhances consistency.

Result: Point-Seg achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art models in high-quality data and better accuracy in lower-quality data, with improved temporal stability. It also provides pixel-level motion information useful for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Point-Seg shows that point tracking is an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography.

Abstract: Purpose: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is a challenging task due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

*Qiang Hu,Qimei Wang,Yingjie Guo,Qiang Li,Zhiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PaGKD is a novel framework for cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data, eliminating the need for paired images and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance WLI-only models for endoscopic cancer screening by transferring knowledge from NBI without requiring paired images, addressing impractical and costly data constraints.

Method: PaGKD uses Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) and Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) to distill modality-invariant knowledge and align dense features, respectively, without image-level correspondence.

Result: PaGKD achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with relative AUC boosts of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2% across four clinical datasets.

Conclusion: PaGKD establishes a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data, offering superior performance and practicality.

Abstract: White-Light Imaging (WLI) is the standard for endoscopic cancer screening, but Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) offers superior diagnostic details. A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the limitation of existing methods that only predict affordance regions on visible surfaces, by reconstructing complete geometry and grounding affordances on the full shape.

Method: Proposes Affostruction, which includes generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion, flow-based affordance grounding, and affordance-driven active view selection.

Result: Affostruction achieves a 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7% improvement).

Conclusion: The framework enables accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of affordance grounding from RGBD images of an object, which aims to localize surface regions corresponding to a text query that describes an action on the object. While existing methods predict affordance regions only on visible surfaces, we propose Affostruction, a generative framework that reconstructs complete geometry from partial observations and grounds affordances on the full shape including unobserved regions. We make three core contributions: generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling. Affostruction achieves 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4\% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7\% improvement), enabling accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COOL-SD introduces an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding with theoretical backing, improving speed-quality trade-offs in autoregressive image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow inference in autoregressive image models due to sequential nature and ambiguous image tokens, even with speculative decoding. Existing solutions lack theoretical grounding.

Method: Establishes theoretical basis for relaxed speculative decoding (COOL-SD), analyzing total variation distance and perturbation behavior for optimal resampling and annealing design.

Result: COOL-SD generates images faster with comparable quality or better quality at similar latency, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: COOL-SD consistently improves speed-quality trade-offs over prior methods, offering a theoretically grounded solution.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in autoregressive image generation, inference remains slow due to the sequential nature of AR models and the ambiguity of image tokens, even when using speculative decoding. Recent works attempt to address this with relaxed speculative decoding but lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we establish the theoretical basis of relaxed SD and propose COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding built on two key insights. The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance. The second uses perturbation analysis to reveal an annealing behaviour in relaxed speculative decoding, motivating our annealed design. Together, these insights enable COOL-SD to generate images faster with comparable quality, or achieve better quality at similar latency. Experiments validate the effectiveness of COOL-SD, showing consistent improvements over prior methods in speed-quality trade-offs.

TL;DR: SpikeVAEDiff combines VDVAE and Versatile Diffusion for high-resolution image reconstruction from neural spike data, showing superior resolution over fMRI and highlighting the VISI region's importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to advance the reconstruction of natural visual scenes from neural activity, addressing the challenge of decoding neural spike data into meaningful images.

Method: A two-stage framework: VDVAE maps neural spikes to latent representations for low-resolution reconstructions, while CLIP-Vision/Text features guide Versatile Diffusion for refinement.

Result: The VISI region is key for quality reconstruction, and spike data outperforms fMRI in resolution. Ablation studies confirm specific brain regions enhance performance.

Conclusion: SpikeVAEDiff effectively reconstructs images from neural spikes, with insights into regional brain contributions and improved resolution over traditional methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing natural visual scenes from neural activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and computer vision. We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.
  We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity. Compared with fMRI-based approaches, spike data provides superior temporal and spatial resolution. We further validate the effectiveness of the VDVAE model and conduct ablation studies demonstrating that data from specific brain regions significantly enhances reconstruction performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection, using textual supervision to enhance feature disentanglement and alignment, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared object detection suffers from low contrast and weak edge information, making feature extraction challenging. The paper aims to improve robustness by leveraging textual semantic information.

Method: The authors introduce Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) to align object features with text features and Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) to minimize correlation between object and non-object features.

Result: The approach achieves 83.7% mAP on M³FD and 86.1% mAP on FLIR benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed vision-language paradigm effectively enhances infrared object detection by leveraging textual supervision for feature disentanglement and alignment.

Abstract: Infrared object detection focuses on identifying and locating objects in complex environments (\eg, dark, snow, and rain) where visible imaging cameras are disabled by poor illumination. However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on two benchmarks: M\textsuperscript{3}FD (83.7\% mAP), FLIR (86.1\% mAP). Our code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning face recognition methods lack mechanisms to model cross-domain correspondence between forensic modalities.

Method: Constructs superpixel-based graphs from images and uses GNNs with attention-guided optimal transport for cross-domain embedding.

Result: Significant improvements in Recall and mAP metrics over baselines on IIT_Mandi_S2F and CUFS datasets.

Conclusion: SPOT-Face is highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.

Abstract: Person identification in forensic investigations becomes very challenging when common identification means for DNA (i.e., hair strands, soft tissue) are not available. Current methods utilize deep learning methods for face recognition. However, these methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between two different forensic modalities. In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism. We have evaluated our proposed framework on two publicly available dataset: IIT\_Mandi\_S2F (S2F) and CUFS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed framework. The experimental results show significant improvement in identification metrics ( i.e., Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates to be highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for descriptors with high discriminative power and computational efficiency for tasks like robot navigation and augmented reality.

Method: Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD) with learnable offsets, hardware-aware kernel fusion, and a scalable framework integrating lightweight architectures.

Result: Achieves superior matching accuracy and efficiency; ultra-compact variant reduces model size by 99.7%, while high-performance configuration exceeds 200 FPS.

Conclusion: CLIDD provides a scalable, real-time solution for high-precision local feature matching with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Robust local feature representations are essential for spatial intelligence tasks such as robot navigation and augmented reality. Establishing reliable correspondences requires descriptors that provide both high discriminative power and computational efficiency. To address this, we introduce Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD), a method that achieves superior distinctiveness by sampling directly from independent feature hierarchies. This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations. To ensure real-time performance, we implement a hardware-aware kernel fusion strategy that maximizes inference throughput. Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the ultra-compact variant matches the precision of SuperPoint while utilizing only 0.004M parameters, achieving a 99.7% reduction in model size. Furthermore, our high-performance configuration outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods, including high-capacity DINOv2-based frameworks, while exceeding 200 FPS on edge devices. These results demonstrate that CLIDD delivers high-precision local feature matching with minimal computational overhead, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time spatial intelligence tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework integrating Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into Stable Diffusion for realistic synthesis of substation meter defect images from limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of few-shot generation due to scarcity of annotated defect samples in substation meters, crucial for power grid stability.

Method: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding, geometric crack modeling for parameterized control maps, and a hypernetwork modulating the denoising process.

Result: Significant improvements: 32.7% FID reduction, higher diversity, and 15.3% mAP boost for downstream defect detection.

Conclusion: The framework provides a high-quality, practical solution for synthesizing defect images in industrial inspection systems with rare defect samples.

Abstract: Substation meters play a critical role in monitoring and ensuring the stable operation of power grids, yet their detection of cracks and other physical defects is often hampered by a severe scarcity of annotated samples. To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data.
  First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics.
  Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation.
  Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability.
  Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data. The framework offers a practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection systems where defect samples are rare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeTracker is a novel framework for multi-object tracking in unstabilized satellite videos, using motion decoupling and temporal feature fusion to improve accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking objects in unstabilized satellite videos is challenging due to platform jitter and tiny object appearances, leading to degraded performance.

Method: DeTracker uses a Global--Local Motion Decoupling module to separate platform and object motion and a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid for cross-frame feature fusion.

Result: Achieved 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU dataset and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite data, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: DeTracker effectively addresses tracking challenges in unstabilized satellite videos, demonstrating superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Satellite videos provide continuous observations of surface dynamics but pose significant challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), especially under unstabilized conditions where platform jitter and the weak appearance of tiny objects jointly degrade tracking performance. To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.

TL;DR: A novel representation, adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), improves texture efficiency and image quality in 3D scene rendering by using anisotropic textures and adaptive resolution allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use fixed square textures per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability.

Method: Introduces A$^2$TG, which equips each primitive with an anisotropic texture and uses a gradient-guided adaptive rule to determine texture resolution and aspect ratio.

Result: Demonstrates improved texture efficiency, reduced memory consumption, and enhanced image quality, outperforming fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods.

Conclusion: A$^2$TG achieves comparable rendering fidelity with lower memory requirements, making it a superior choice for high-quality, real-time 3D scene rendering.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful representation for high-quality, real-time 3D scene rendering. While recent works extend Gaussians with learnable textures to enrich visual appearance, existing approaches allocate a fixed square texture per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats. This design significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that A TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.

TL;DR: LoRA-DETR introduces a flexible framework using Low-Rank Adaptation branches to integrate diverse one-to-many assignment strategies into DETR-style detectors, enhancing performance without added inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the slow convergence in DETR-style detectors due to sparse supervision from one-to-one matching, aiming to improve performance without complex modifications.

Method: LoRA-DETR employs multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each implementing a different one-to-many assignment rule, to enrich supervisory signals without inference overhead.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results by leveraging diverse supervision strategies, enhancing detector performance while maintaining architectural simplicity.

Conclusion: Diverse one-to-many supervision can be efficiently integrated into DETR-style detectors using LoRA-DETR, offering a scalable and elegant solution for improved performance.

Abstract: Label assignment is a critical component in object detectors, particularly within DETR-style frameworks where the one-to-one matching strategy, despite its end-to-end elegance, suffers from slow convergence due to sparse supervision. While recent works have explored one-to-many assignments to enrich supervisory signals, they often introduce complex, architecture-specific modifications and typically focus on a single auxiliary strategy, lacking a unified and scalable design. In this paper, we first systematically investigate the effects of ``one-to-many'' supervision and reveal a surprising insight that performance gains are driven not by the sheer quantity of supervision, but by the diversity of the assignment strategies employed. This finding suggests that a more elegant, parameter-efficient approach is attainable. Building on this insight, we propose LoRA-DETR, a flexible and lightweight framework that seamlessly integrates diverse assignment strategies into any DETR-style detector. Our method augments the primary network with multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each instantiating a different one-to-many assignment rule. These branches act as auxiliary modules that inject rich, varied supervisory gradients into the main model and are discarded during inference, thus incurring no additional computational cost. This design promotes robust joint optimization while maintaining the architectural simplicity of the original detector. Extensive experiments on different baselines validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our work presents a new paradigm for enhancing detectors, demonstrating that diverse ``one-to-many'' supervision can be integrated to achieve state-of-the-art results without compromising model elegance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents need precise localization in GPS-denied environments, but current VPR models are either too memory-intensive or lack robustness.

Method: Combines event-based vision sensors with a novel guided VAE, using a spiking neural network encoder for power efficiency.

Result: Successfully disentangles features of 16 distinct places, showing robust performance under varying illumination and high generalization with unknown scenes.

Conclusion: The compact and robust guided VAE enhances mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents such as cars, robots and drones need to precisely localize themselves in diverse environments, including in GPS-denied indoor environments. One approach for precise localization is visual place recognition (VPR), which estimates the place of an image based on previously seen places. State-of-the-art VPR models require high amounts of memory, making them unwieldy for mobile deployment, while more compact models lack robustness and generalization capabilities. This work overcomes these limitations for robotics using a combination of event-based vision sensors and an event-based novel guided variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder part of our model is based on a spiking neural network model which is compatible with power-efficient low latency neuromorphic hardware. The VAE successfully disentangles the visual features of 16 distinct places in our new indoor VPR dataset with a classification performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches while, showing robust performance also under various illumination conditions. When tested with novel visual inputs from unknown scenes, our model can distinguish between these places, which demonstrates a high generalization capability by learning the essential features of location. Our compact and robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities poses a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PhyRPR, a training-free three-stage pipeline (PhyReason–PhyPlan–PhyRefine) to decouple physical reasoning from visual synthesis in video generation, improving physical plausibility and motion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based video generation models often fail to satisfy physical constraints because they entangle physical understanding with visual synthesis, limiting explicit physical reasoning.

Method: PhyRPR divides the process into three stages: PhyReason uses large multimodal models for physical reasoning and keyframe synthesis; PhyPlan creates a controllable motion scaffold; PhyRefine integrates the scaffold into diffusion sampling to refine appearance while preserving dynamics.

Result: Experiments show PhyRPR consistently enhances physical plausibility and motion controllability in generated videos.

Conclusion: The staged approach of PhyRPR successfully decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis, enabling explicit physical control in video generation.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based video generation models can synthesize visually plausible videos, yet they often struggle to satisfy physical constraints. A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline,\textit{PhyRPR}:\textit{Phy\uline{R}eason}--\textit{Phy\uline{P}lan}--\textit{Phy\uline{R}efine}, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, \textit{PhyReason} uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; \textit{PhyPlan} deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and \textit{PhyRefine} injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of timely and accurate wildfire delineation due to irregular spectral changes and trade-offs in satellite system capabilities.

Method: Employs a deep learning model leveraging multi-source satellite imagery for high-resolution, timely burn scar mapping.

Result: Achieves high accuracy in detecting small-scale wildfires, outperforming existing change detection models and baselines.

Conclusion: BAM-MRCD effectively balances spatial and temporal resolution, offering operational utility for rapid wildfire assessment.

Abstract: Delineating wildfire affected areas using satellite imagery remains challenging due to irregular and spatially heterogeneous spectral changes across the electromagnetic spectrum. While recent deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy when high-resolution multispectral data are available, their applicability in operational settings, where a quick delineation of the burn scar shortly after a wildfire incident is required, is limited by the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency of current satellite systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely BAM-MRCD, which employs multi-resolution, multi-source satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2) for the timely production of detailed burnt area maps with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our model manages to detect even small scale wildfires with high accuracy, surpassing similar change detection models as well as solid baselines.

TL;DR: BrainSegNet adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional template-registration methods are slow, and large models like SAM lack precision for brain parcellation.

Method: BrainSegNet enhances SAM with U-Net skip connections, multi-scale attention decoder, and boundary refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the HCP dataset with higher accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: BrainSegNet effectively adapts SAM for precise whole-brain parcellation.

Abstract: Whole-brain parcellation from MRI is a critical yet challenging task due to the complexity of subdividing the brain into numerous small, irregular shaped regions. Traditionally, template-registration methods were used, but recent advances have shifted to deep learning for faster workflows. While large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer transferable feature representations, they are not tailored for the high precision required in brain parcellation. To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that BrainSegNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in complex, multi-label parcellation.

TL;DR: GaussianFluent introduces a framework combining generative models and optimized CD-MPM for simulating brittle fractures in 3DGS, enabling realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods focused on soft materials, leaving brittle fracture unresolved due to texture coherence and simulation limitations.

Method: Densifies internal Gaussians with generative models and uses optimized CD-MPM for high-speed brittle fracture simulation.

Result: Achieves photo-realistic, real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors, handling complex scenarios like mixed-material objects.

Conclusion: GaussianFluent shows promise for applications in VR and robotics by overcoming previous limitations in 3DGS fracture simulation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent 3D representation for high-fidelity and real-time rendering. Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods. Experiments clearly demonstrate GaussianFluent's capability for photo-realistic, real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors, highlighting its potential for downstream application, such as VR and Robotics.

### [47] [Multi-Modal LLM based Image Captioning in ICT: Bridging the Gap Between General and Industry Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09298)
*Lianying Chao,Haoran Cai,Xubin Li,Kai Zhang,Sijie Wu,Rui Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-stage training strategy to develop a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) for the ICT industry, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters compared to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack the ability to caption images with domain-specific knowledge in ICT, prompting the need for a specialized model.

Method: A multi-stage progressive training approach using synthesized and expert-annotated image-text pairs, followed by instruction-based fine-tuning.

Result: DICModel outperforms larger SOTA models, improving BLEU metrics by 56.8% and 20.8% and achieving higher accuracy on expert-constructed questions.

Conclusion: The DICModel effectively extracts logical text from images, advancing multimodal models in the ICT domain.

Abstract: In the information and communications technology (ICT) industry, training a domain-specific large language model (LLM) or constructing a retrieval-augmented generation system requires a substantial amount of high-value domain knowledge. However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.

### [48] [Frequency Error-Guided Under-sampling Optimization for Multi-Contrast MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09316)
*Xinming Fang,Chaoyan Huang,Juncheng Li,Jun Wang,Jun Shi,Guixu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a frequency error-guided framework for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction, addressing limitations in existing methods by combining conditional diffusion models, deep unfolding, and spatial alignment to improve efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long acquisition times and motion artifacts hinder MRI diagnostics. Existing multi-contrast MRI reconstruction methods lack effective reference fusion, underutilize complementary information, and rely on fixed under-sampling patterns.

Method: The proposed framework uses a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP), integrates it into a deep unfolding framework, and includes spatial alignment and reference feature decomposition modules.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes, both quantitatively and visually.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient, interpretable solution for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction, with potential to enhance clinical diagnostics by reducing acquisition time and artifacts.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in clinical diagnostics, yet it remains hindered by long acquisition times and motion artifacts. Multi-contrast MRI reconstruction has emerged as a promising direction by leveraging complementary information from fully-sampled reference scans. However, existing approaches suffer from three major limitations: (1) superficial reference fusion strategies, such as simple concatenation, (2) insufficient utilization of the complementary information provided by the reference contrast, and (3) fixed under-sampling patterns. We propose an efficient and interpretable frequency error-guided reconstruction framework to tackle these issues. We first employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP), which is then incorporated into a unified framework for jointly optimizing both the under-sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. The proposed reconstruction model employs a model-driven deep unfolding framework that jointly exploits frequency- and image-domain information. In addition, a spatial alignment module and a reference feature decomposition strategy are incorporated to improve reconstruction quality and bridge model-based optimization with data-driven learning for improved physical interpretability. Comprehensive validation across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficiently adapting large-scale foundation models to downstream tasks using an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer, outperforming standard linear probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of adapting large-scale foundation models to downstream tasks efficiently, as linear probing often restricts itself to last-layer representations, missing distributed task-relevant information across the network.

Method: An attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer, learning to identify the most relevant layers for a task and combining low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions.

Result: Substantial gains over standard linear probes across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, with attention heatmaps showing tasks benefit most from intermediate representations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a task-aware approach for probing-based adaptation, unlocking their potential effectively.

Abstract: With the rise of large-scale foundation models, efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks remains a central challenge. Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps further reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations. Overall, our findings underscore the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a principled, task aware approach for unlocking their potential in probing-based adaptation.

*Wei Liu,Xing Deng,Haijian Shao,Yingtao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAP measures channel redundancy in CNNs using complex interaction fields and spectral reconstruction fidelity to prune less important channels, achieving significant FLOP and parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address functional redundancy in convolutional layers by identifying compressible channels via spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields.

Method: Construct complex fields (input as real, output channel as imaginary), transform to frequency domain, train autoencoder to reconstruct spectra, and prune based on reconstruction fidelity.

Result: Achieved 90.11% FLOP and 96.30% parameter reduction on VGG16/CIFAR-10 with only 1.67% accuracy drop from baseline.

Conclusion: Spectral reconstruction fidelity effectively identifies redundant channels, enabling aggressive compression while maintaining performance.

Abstract: We propose Spectral Complex Autoencoder Pruning (SCAP), a reconstruction-based criterion that measures functional redundancy at the level of individual output channels. For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression.

*Sangjun Han,Youngmi Hur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods—Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and repeated upscaling/downscaling—to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image super-resolution is crucial for real-world applications, and enhancing fine details (high-frequency information) is key to improving image quality.

Method: The authors introduce a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling/downscaling process to guide models in focusing on high-frequency components.

Result: Their CNN-based model outperforms existing CNN-based and some attention-based models. Attention-based models incorporating their detail loss also show improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures, demonstrating their robustness and versatility.

Abstract: With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals. These results demonstrate our approaches effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures.

*Yaxi Chen,Zi Ye,Shaheer U. Saeed,Oliver Yu,Simin Ni,Jie Huang,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in osteosarcoma diagnosis by proposing radiomic features and hierarchical classification to improve deep learning model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual histopathological assessment of osteosarcoma is labor-intensive and subjective, necessitating automated, accurate solutions.

Method: Uses radiomic features and a hierarchical loss approach for tumor classification, optimizing two binary tasks instead of a flat three-class task.

Result: The proposed methods improve classification performance and interpretability, achieving state-of-the-art results on the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset.

Conclusion: Combining radiomic features with hierarchical classification enhances model accuracy and interpretability for osteosarcoma assessment.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone malignancy. Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

TL;DR: Video-MSR is a benchmark evaluating Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in videos, revealing MLLMs' limitations in complex spatial tasks. MSR-9K dataset and fine-tuning improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack evaluation of complex visual-spatial logical chains, necessitating a dedicated benchmark for MSR in dynamic scenarios.

Method: Introduces Video-MSR with four tasks, 3,052 videos, and 4,993 Q&A pairs, created via model generation and human verification. Evaluates 20 MLLMs and improves Qwen-VL with MSR-9K.

Result: MLLMs struggle with MSR tasks, showing spatial disorientation and hallucination. Fine-tuning with MSR-9K boosts Qwen-VL's performance by +7.82%.

Conclusion: Video-MSR fills a critical gap and demonstrates the need for specialized MSR data to enhance model capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), drawing increasing attention and rapid advancement. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research.

Recent research in this area has shown promise in focusing on identification of semantic elements as they are commonly depicted on ancient coins, by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This paper is the first to apply the recently proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) deep learning architecture to the task of identification of semantic elements on coins, using fully automatic learning from multi-modal data (images and unstructured text). This article summarises previous research in the area, discusses the training and implementation of ViT and CNN models for ancient coins analysis and provides an evaluation of their performance. The ViT models were found to outperform the newly trained CNN models in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAD-LTX, a framework adapting video diffusion models for autonomous driving by decoupling motion learning from appearance synthesis, achieving efficiency and superior performance with minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist video diffusion models lack structured motion and physical consistency needed for autonomous driving and typically require extensive domain-specific data.

Method: A two-stage adaptation framework: first learns structured motion using skeletonized agents and scenes, then synthesizes realistic RGB videos conditioned on the motion sequences.

Result: MAD-LTX matches prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute and outperforms open-source competitors, supporting diverse controls.

Conclusion: Decoupling motion and appearance synthesis efficiently adapts generalist models for driving, achieving high performance with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models generate photorealistic, temporally coherent videos, yet they fall short as reliable world models for autonomous driving, where structured motion and physically consistent interactions are essential. Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively "dressing" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) by evaluating detector performance across diverse dataset settings, revealing stable transfer within same settings but significant drops across different ones, with domain shift being a major factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how object detectors perform under cross-dataset scenarios, particularly focusing on setting specificity (agnostic vs. specific datasets) and identifying key challenges like domain shift.

Method: Evaluates standard detectors across train-test pairs of datasets grouped by setting type (agnostic or specific) and uses CLIP similarity for open-label alignment to mitigate label mismatches.

Result: Transfer within same setting types is stable, while cross-setting transfers drop sharply, especially from specific to agnostic datasets. Open-label alignment provides limited improvements, correcting semantic near-misses.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into CD-OD under setting specificity, highlighting domain shift as a dominant challenge, and provides practical evaluation guidance. Code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Object detectors often perform well in-distribution, yet degrade sharply on a different benchmark. We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

TL;DR: V-DPM extends Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) to videos for dynamic 3D reconstruction, leveraging pretrained models and synthetic data to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D/4D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and require post-processing for multiple views, limiting their utility for videos.

Method: Formulates DPMs for video input to maximize representational power and neural prediction, adapting VGGT with synthetic data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic scene reconstruction, recovering full 3D motion of every point.

Conclusion: V-DPM demonstrates the effectiveness of extending DPMs to videos for improved dynamic 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Powerful 3D representations such as DUSt3R invariant point maps, which encode 3D shape and camera parameters, have significantly advanced feed forward 3D reconstruction. While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.

Motivation: To improve Facial Expression Recognition by leveraging embedding-based pre-training instead of traditional pixel-reconstruction methods.

Result: Achieves top performance on RAVDESS and outperforms vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR), showing strong generalization in cross-dataset tests.

Conclusion: Embedding-based pre-training like V-JEPAs holds promise for advancing FER, with released code for reproducibility.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPAs) for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER.

*Yue Yao,Ruining Yang,Tom Gedeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical data server and bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes for unsupervised domain adaptation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of constructing competitive training sets from large-scale data servers when real-time target domain annotation is infeasible.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical data server and BMM algorithm to match source and target modes optimally.

Result: Demonstrates smaller domain gaps and higher model accuracy in re-ID and detection tasks.

Conclusion: BMM complements model-centric UDA methods and improves performance when combined with techniques like pseudo-labeling.

Abstract: We explore a situation in which the target domain is accessible, but real-time data annotation is not feasible. Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods. By combining the BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling, further improvement is observed.

### [62] [Hot-Start from Pixels: Low-Resolution Visual Tokens for Chinese Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09566)
*Shuyang Xiang,Hao Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using grayscale images of Chinese characters instead of token IDs achieves comparable accuracy, showing visual inputs can be effective for language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore if low-resolution visual inputs can replace traditional index-based tokens for Chinese character modeling, leveraging their semantic and phonetic information.

Method: Decoder receives grayscale images of characters (as low as 8x8 pixels) instead of token IDs.

Result: Visual inputs achieve 39.2% accuracy, similar to the 39.1% baseline. Low-resource training shows faster early progress (hot-start effect).

Conclusion: Minimal visual structure offers a robust alternative to index-based approaches for Chinese language modeling.

Abstract: Large language models typically represent Chinese characters as discrete index-based tokens, largely ignoring their visual form. For logographic scripts, visual structure carries semantic and phonetic information, which may aid prediction. We investigate whether low-resolution visual inputs can serve as an alternative for character-level modeling. Instead of token IDs, our decoder receives grayscale images of individual characters, with resolutions as low as $8 \times 8$ pixels. Remarkably, these inputs achieve 39.2\% accuracy, comparable to the index-based baseline of 39.1\%. Such low-resource settings also exhibit a pronounced \emph{hot-start} effect: by 0.4\% of total training, accuracy reaches above 12\%, while index-based models lag at below 6\%. Overall, our results demonstrate that minimal visual structure can provide a robust and efficient signal for Chinese language modeling, offering an alternative perspective on character representation that complements traditional index-based approaches.

*Tianli Tao,Ziyang Wang,Delong Yang,Han Zhang,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DF-DiffCom, a KAN-enhanced diffusion model, uses deformation fields to improve longitudinal brain MRI completion, outperforming existing methods and offering versatility across MRI modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High attrition rates in longitudinal brain MRI studies cause missing data, complicating analysis. Current deep generative models lack fidelity and flexibility due to reliance on image intensity alone.

Method: DF-DiffCom integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with diffusion models, leveraging deformation fields for trustworthy image completion.

Result: Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom improves PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12, excelling in fidelity and versatility across MRI modalities.

Conclusion: DF-DiffCom addresses key limitations of existing methods, offering high-quality, modality-agnostic solutions for longitudinal brain MRI completion.

Abstract: Longitudinal brain MRI is essential for lifespan study, yet high attrition rates often lead to missing data, complicating analysis. Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. More importantly, its modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities, even to attribute maps such as brain tissue segmentation results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenVoxel is a training-free algorithm for grouping and captioning sparse voxels in 3D scenes, leveraging VLMs and MLLMs for open-vocabulary tasks like segmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to enable open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding without the need for training or text encoder embeddings, simplifying the process while maintaining performance.

Method: OpenVoxel groups sparse voxels from multi-view images and captions them using VLMs and MLLMs, avoiding training or CLIP/BERT embeddings by using text-to-text search.

Result: The method outperforms recent studies, especially in complex referring expression segmentation tasks, and builds informative scene maps.

Conclusion: OpenVoxel offers a training-free, efficient solution for 3D scene understanding tasks, with plans to release the code publicly.

Abstract: We propose OpenVoxel, a training-free algorithm for grouping and captioning sparse voxels for the open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks. Given the sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) model obtained from multi-view images of a 3D scene, our OpenVoxel is able to produce meaningful groups that describe different objects in the scene. Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES). Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks. The code will be open.

### [66] [Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM) method for fine rigid pairwise 3D Point Cloud Registration: A Focus on the Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09601)
*Emmanuele Barberi,Felice Sfravara,Filippo Cucinotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel differential entropy-based metric (IDEM) for robust 3D point cloud registration, overcoming limitations of traditional methods like RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional point cloud registration methods struggle with issues like density differences, noise, holes, and limited overlap, often requiring preprocessing or fixed point clouds. The authors aim to address these limitations.

Method: The authors propose Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM), a differential entropy-based metric used as an objective function for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration.

Result: IDEM outperforms traditional metrics (RMSE, Chamfer distance, Hausdorff distance) in handling density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, demonstrating robustness without needing a fixed point cloud.

Conclusion: The proposed IDEM metric is a robust solution for point cloud registration, especially in challenging scenarios where traditional metrics falter, offering a clear alignment minimum.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a central theme in computer vision, with alignment algorithms continuously improving for greater robustness. Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.

### [67] [Sim2real Image Translation Enables Viewpoint-Robust Policies from Fixed-Camera Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09605)
*Jeremiah Coholich,Justin Wit,Robert Azarcon,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANGO is an unpaired image translation method designed to address viewpoint variations in sim2real scenarios, using novel loss functions and regularization techniques to enhance viewpoint consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based robot manipulation policies suffer from distribution shifts like camera viewpoint changes. Real-world demonstration data lacks viewpoint diversity, while simulation offers scalability but poses sim2real visual challenges.

Method: MANGO introduces a segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator, and a modified PatchNCE loss. It translates simulated observations to diverse real-world viewpoints using minimal fixed-camera real data.

Result: MANGO outperforms other image translation methods, enabling imitation-learning policies trained on augmented data to achieve 60% success rates on previously failed viewpoints.

Conclusion: MANGO effectively bridges the sim2real gap for viewpoint variations, enhancing the robustness of vision-based robot manipulation policies.

Abstract: Vision-based policies for robot manipulation have achieved significant recent success, but are still brittle to distribution shifts such as camera viewpoint variations. Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on data augmented by MANGO are able to achieve success rates as high as 60\% on views that the non-augmented policy fails completely on.

### [68] [GRCF: Two-Stage Groupwise Ranking and Calibration Framework for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09606)
*Manning Gao,Leheng Zhang,Shiqin Han,Haifeng Hu,Yuncheng Jiang,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) to improve multimodal sentiment analysis by addressing issues like label noise and unstable predictions in pairwise ordinal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in multimodal sentiment analysis are either too sensitive to label noise or fail to capture relative sentiment orders effectively. Pairwise ordinal learning introduces new trade-offs, such as uniform importance to comparisons and static ranking margins.

Method: GRCF uses a two-stage approach: Stage 1 employs a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 aligns prediction magnitudes with an MAE-driven objective.

Result: GRCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on regression benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalizability in classification tasks like humor and sarcasm detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully resolves trade-offs in pairwise ordinal learning, improving both relative ordinal structure and absolute score calibration in multimodal sentiment analysis.

Abstract: Most Multimodal Sentiment Analysis research has focused on point-wise regression. While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection. GRCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks, while also showing strong generalizability in classification tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogRail, a benchmark for cognitive intrusion perception in railways, evaluates VLMs, and proposes a joint fine-tuning framework to enhance performance in spatial-temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems for railway safety focus narrowly on object classification and overlook latent intrusion risks, requiring better spatial-temporal reasoning.

Method: Proposes CogRail benchmark with question-answer annotations, evaluates VLMs, and introduces a joint fine-tuning framework for position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis.

Result: Current VLMs struggle with spatial-temporal reasoning, but the proposed framework significantly improves performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: The joint fine-tuning framework addresses limitations of foundation models in safety-critical domains, enhancing accuracy and interpretability for cognitive intrusion perception.

Abstract: Accurate and early perception of potential intrusion targets is essential for ensuring the safety of railway transportation systems. However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose security flaws in anonymous voting-based T2I leaderboards by demonstrating deanonymization vulnerabilities.

Method: A centroid-based approach analyzes image embeddings from 22 T2I models and 280 prompts (150K images) to identify distinctive clusters and deanonymize outputs.

Result: High deanonymization accuracy, revealing systematic model-specific signatures and prompts with near-perfect distinguishability.

Conclusion: The findings highlight security flaws in T2I leaderboards and emphasize the need for stronger anonymization defenses.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly popular, producing a large share of AI-generated images online. To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A feed-forward framework predicts simulation-ready garments from a single image by inferring material properties and fabric attributes, achieving higher-fidelity simulations without iterative optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in estimating physically accurate garments from a single image due to the lack of datasets and the ill-posed nature of the problem. Existing methods require expensive multi-view capture or lack material properties for realistic simulation.

Method: The approach fine-tunes a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from images, then uses a lightweight predictor to map these to physical fabric parameters. Two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) are introduced.

Result: The method achieves superior accuracy in material estimation and fabric attribute prediction, leading to higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image, overcoming prior limitations and enabling more realistic simulations without iterative processes.

Abstract: Estimating physically accurate, simulation-ready garments from a single image is challenging due to the absence of image-to-physics datasets and the ill-posed nature of this problem. Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.

TL;DR: LiteEmbed is a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP, improving zero-shot recognition for rare or unseen classes without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with rare or culturally specific classes; LiteEmbed aims to adapt CLIP for these underrepresented categories efficiently.

Method: LiteEmbed optimizes text embeddings using PCA-based decomposition, focusing on coarse semantic alignment and fine separation for discriminability.

Result: Experiments show LiteEmbed outperforms prior methods in adapting CLIP to rare or unseen classes across various tasks.

Conclusion: LiteEmbed effectively personalizes CLIP for underrepresented classes without retraining, enhancing its versatility.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but struggle with classes that are rarely seen during pretraining, including newly emerging entities and culturally specific categories. We introduce LiteEmbed, a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that enables new classes to be added without retraining its encoders. LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised method for efficient animal identification in videos, using global clustering and minimal manual annotation, achieves >97% accuracy with low computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional manual annotation and computationally intensive self-supervised methods for animal identification in long-duration videos.

Method: Reframes identification as global clustering, uses frozen pre-trained backbone, self-bootstrapping with Hungarian algorithm, and Binary Cross Entropy loss for feature learning.

Result: Achieves >97% accuracy with <1 GB GPU memory per batch, matching or surpassing supervised baselines on real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons, 8-calves).

Conclusion: Enables high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, eliminating manual annotation bottlenecks for resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Identifying individual animals in long-duration videos is essential for behavioral ecology, wildlife monitoring, and livestock management. Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck. This work enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCE-SLAM is an end-to-end SLAM system that reduces scale drift in monocular visual SLAM using scene coordinate embeddings, achieving better accuracy and scale consistency while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular visual SLAM suffers from scale drift due to lack of global constraints, limiting its accuracy over long sequences.

Method: SCE-SLAM uses learned patch-level scene coordinate embeddings to maintain scale consistency, incorporating geometry-guided aggregation and scene coordinate bundle adjustment.

Result: The method reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI and maintains 36 FPS, achieving scale consistency in large-scale scenes.

Conclusion: SCE-SLAM effectively addresses scale drift in monocular SLAM, offering improved accuracy and real-time performance.

Abstract: Monocular visual SLAM enables 3D reconstruction from internet video and autonomous navigation on resource-constrained platforms, yet suffers from scale drift, i.e., the gradual divergence of estimated scale over long sequences. Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings. Experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI demonstrate substantial improvements: our method reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to the best prior approach, while maintaining 36 FPS and achieving scale consistency across large-scale scenes.

Abstract: We present STEP3-VL-10B, a lightweight open-source foundation model designed to redefine the trade-off between compact efficiency and frontier-level multimodal intelligence. STEP3-VL-10B is realized through two strategic shifts: first, a unified, fully unfrozen pre-training strategy on 1.2T multimodal tokens that integrates a language-aligned Perception Encoder with a Qwen3-8B decoder to establish intrinsic vision-language synergy; and second, a scaled post-training pipeline featuring over 1k iterations of reinforcement learning. Crucially, we implement Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) to scale test-time compute, allocating resources to scalable perceptual reasoning that explores and synthesizes diverse visual hypotheses. Consequently, despite its compact 10B footprint, STEP3-VL-10B rivals or surpasses models 10$\times$-20$\times$ larger (e.g., GLM-4.6V-106B, Qwen3-VL-235B) and top-tier proprietary flagships like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Seed-1.5-VL. Delivering best-in-class performance, it records 92.2% on MMBench and 80.11% on MMMU, while excelling in complex reasoning with 94.43% on AIME2025 and 75.95% on MathVision. We release the full model suite to provide the community with a powerful, efficient, and reproducible baseline.

*Jieying Chen,Jeffrey Hu,Joan Lasenby,Ayush Tewari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRENDER speeds up video generation by using sparse keyframes and 3D rendering, achieving 40x faster results than diffusion-based methods while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of diffusion-based video generative models, which hinder real-time applications like AI and VR/AR, by leveraging 3D reconstruction.

Method: Generates sparse keyframes with diffusion models, lifts them into 3D representations, renders intermediate views, and adaptively predicts keyframe density based on camera motion.

Result: Achieves a 40x speedup in generating 20-second videos compared to diffusion baselines, with high visual fidelity and temporal stability.

Conclusion: SRENDER offers a practical, efficient, and controllable solution for video synthesis, overcoming computational barriers for real-time use.

Abstract: Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.

*Tony Danjun Wang,Tolga Birdal,Nassir Navab,Lennart Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COMPOSE improves 3D pose estimation by treating multi-view correspondence as a hypergraph problem, achieving significant precision gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on brittle pairwise associations for multi-view 3D pose estimation, which propagate errors. COMPOSE addresses this by leveraging hypergraph partitioning for global consistency.

Method: COMPOSE formulates multi-view pose correspondence as a hypergraph partitioning problem, using geometric pruning to efficiently solve the complex integer linear program.

Result: COMPOSE outperforms optimization-based methods by up to 23% and self-supervised methods by up to 11% in average precision.

Conclusion: COMPOSE offers a robust and efficient solution for multi-view 3D pose estimation, surpassing traditional pairwise approaches.

Abstract: 3D pose estimation from sparse multi-views is a critical task for numerous applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, and human-robot interaction. Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem.

*Ruiqi Shen,Chang Liu,Henghui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM3-DMS improves SAM3's memory selection for multi-object tracking by decoupling decisions per object, enhancing reliability and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3's synchronized memory selection performs suboptimally in complex multi-object scenarios by averaging performance, neglecting individual object reliability.

Method: SAM3-DMS introduces a training-free decoupled strategy with fine-grained memory selection for each object.

Result: Experiments show robust identity preservation and tracking stability, especially in high target density.

Conclusion: SAM3-DMS establishes a solid foundation for multi-target video segmentation, outperforming SAM3 in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Segment Anything 3 (SAM3) has established a powerful foundation that robustly detects, segments, and tracks specified targets in videos. However, in its original implementation, its group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios, as it employs a synchronized decision across all concurrent targets conditioned on their average performance, often overlooking individual reliability. To this end, we propose SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves robust identity preservation and tracking stability. Notably, our advantage becomes more pronounced with increased target density, establishing a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild.

*Chi-Pin Huang,Yunze Man,Zhiding Yu,Min-Hung Chen,Jan Kautz,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Fu-En Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast-ThinkAct is an efficient reasoning framework for VLA tasks, reducing inference latency while maintaining performance through latent reasoning and distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high inference latency in current reasoning VLAs caused by lengthy reasoning traces, while preserving generalization capabilities.

Method: Fast-ThinkAct uses verbalizable latent reasoning and distillation from a teacher model, guided by a preference-aligned objective for efficient reasoning and action execution.

Result: Achieves strong performance with up to 89.3% reduced latency, maintaining long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.

Conclusion: Fast-ThinkAct effectively bridges compact reasoning to action execution, offering a scalable solution for efficient VLA tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.

TL;DR: DELIBERATIONBENCH evaluates multi-agent LLM deliberation, finding that simpler methods outperform complex protocols in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to scrutinize the practical value of multi-agent LLM deliberation systems compared to simpler methods.

Method: A controlled benchmark (DELIBERATIONBENCH) tests three deliberation protocols against a baseline of selecting the best single response from a pool of model outputs, evaluated across 270 questions and three seeds.

Result: The baseline outperforms deliberation protocols with an 82.5% win rate vs. 13.8%, at a 1.5-2.5x higher computational cost, showing statistical significance (p < 0.01).

Conclusion: Complexity in multi-LLM systems does not inherently enhance quality, challenging assumptions about deliberation's superiority.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems where Large Language Models (LLMs) deliberate to form consensus have gained significant attention, yet their practical value over simpler methods remains under-scrutinized. We introduce DELIBERATIONBENCH, a controlled benchmark evaluating three deliberation protocols against a strong baseline of selecting the best response from a pool of model outputs. Across 270 questions and three independent seeds (810 total evaluations), we find a striking negative result: the best-single baseline achieves an 82.5% +- 3.3% win rate, dramatically outperforming the best deliberation protocol(13.8% +- 2.6%). This 6.0x performance gap is statistically significant (p < 0.01) and comes at 1.5-2.5x higher computational cost. Our findings challenge assumptions that complexity enhances quality in multi-LLM systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The review examines PTSD in individuals with chronic illnesses using social media data (2008-2024), highlighting NLP/ML effectiveness (74-90% accuracy) and online support's role in coping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand PTSD's manifestation and management in chronic illness patients via social media and explore interventions.

Method: Systematic literature review focusing on social media platforms (X, Facebook) analyzed with NLP and ML techniques.

Result: Social media provides insights into PTSD-chronic illness challenges; NLP/ML identifies cases (74-90% accuracy); online support aids coping and early intervention.

Conclusion: PTSD research must consider chronic illnesses; social media is a valuable tool for monitoring and supporting vulnerable groups.

Abstract: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a multifaceted mental health condition, particularly challenging for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions. This review critically examines the intersection of PTSD and chronic illnesses as expressed on social media platforms. By systematically analyzing literature from 2008 to 2024, the study explores how PTSD manifests and is managed in individuals with chronic conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune disorders, with a focus on online expressions on platforms like X (formally known as Twitter) and Facebook. Findings demonstrate that social media data offers valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by individuals with both PTSD and chronic illnesses. Specifically, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques can identify potential PTSD cases among these populations, achieving accuracy rates between 74% and 90%. Furthermore, the role of online support communities in shaping coping strategies and facilitating early interventions is highlighted. This review underscores the necessity of incorporating considerations of pre-existing medical conditions in PTSD research and treatment, emphasizing social media's potential as a monitoring and support tool for vulnerable groups. Future research directions and clinical implications are also discussed, with an emphasis on developing targeted interventions.

*Piercosma Bisconti,Marcello Galisai,Matteo Prandi,Federico Pierucci,Olga Sorokoletova,Francesco Giarrusso,Vincenzo Suriani,Marcantonio Brancale,Daniele Nardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adversarial Tales exploit culturally coded narratives to bypass LLM safety mechanisms, achieving a 71.3% success rate across models. Structurally-grounded jailbreaks represent a broad vulnerability, highlighting the need for deeper understanding of intent recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mechanisms fail against attacks that reframe harmful requests through culturally or narratively structured prompts, revealing a systemic vulnerability.

Method: The attack embeds harmful content in cyberpunk narratives and uses Propp's folktale morphology to prompt models into reconstructing harmful procedures as narrative interpretation.

Result: Across 26 models, Adversarial Tales achieved a 71.3% success rate, demonstrating robustness as a vulnerability class rather than an isolated technique.

Conclusion: Structurally-grounded jailbreaks pose a significant challenge, requiring mechanistic interpretability to understand how narrative cues influence model behavior and intent recognition.

Abstract: Safety mechanisms in LLMs remain vulnerable to attacks that reframe harmful requests through culturally coded structures. We introduce Adversarial Tales, a jailbreak technique that embeds harmful content within cyberpunk narratives and prompts models to perform functional analysis inspired by Vladimir Propp's morphology of folktales. By casting the task as structural decomposition, the attack induces models to reconstruct harmful procedures as legitimate narrative interpretation. Across 26 frontier models from nine providers, we observe an average attack success rate of 71.3%, with no model family proving reliably robust. Together with our prior work on Adversarial Poetry, these findings suggest that structurally-grounded jailbreaks constitute a broad vulnerability class rather than isolated techniques. The space of culturally coded frames that can mediate harmful intent is vast, likely inexhaustible by pattern-matching defenses alone. Understanding why these attacks succeed is therefore essential: we outline a mechanistic interpretability research agenda to investigate how narrative cues reshape model representations and whether models can learn to recognize harmful intent independently of surface form.

*Jiahui Chen,Lei Fu,Jian Cui,Yu Lei,Zhenning Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Companion Agents (CA) to improve Text-to-SQL accuracy in annotation-scarce settings by mining and consolidating database-side knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-SQL systems rely on complete database annotations, limiting real-world applicability. The study addresses this by leveraging intrinsic database information.

Method: CA proactively mines hidden inter-table relations, value distributions, and semantic cues, caching query-relevant knowledge for selective activation.

Result: CA improves execution accuracy on BIRD benchmark (+4.49/+4.37/+14.13 points) and shows larger gains (+9.65/+7.58/+16.71) on challenging queries.

Conclusion: CA's database-side mining offers a practical solution for industrial Text-to-SQL deployment without human-curated evidence.

Abstract: Large-scale Text-to-SQL benchmarks such as BIRD typically assume complete and accurate database annotations as well as readily available external knowledge, which fails to reflect common industrial settings where annotations are missing, incomplete, or erroneous. This mismatch substantially limits the real-world applicability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL systems. To bridge this gap, we explore a database-centric approach that leverages intrinsic, fine-grained information residing in relational databases to construct missing evidence and improve Text-to-SQL accuracy under annotation-scarce conditions. Our key hypothesis is that when a query requires multi-step reasoning over extensive table information, existing methods often struggle to reliably identify and utilize the truly relevant knowledge. We therefore propose to "cache" query-relevant knowledge on the database side in advance, so that it can be selectively activated at inference time. Based on this idea, we introduce Companion Agents (CA), a new Text-to-SQL paradigm that incorporates a group of agents accompanying database schemas to proactively mine and consolidate hidden inter-table relations, value-domain distributions, statistical regularities, and latent semantic cues before query generation. Experiments on BIRD under the fully missing evidence setting show that CA recovers +4.49 / +4.37 / +14.13 execution accuracy points on RSL-SQL / CHESS / DAIL-SQL, respectively, with larger gains on the Challenging subset +9.65 / +7.58 / +16.71. These improvements stem from CA's automatic database-side mining and evidence construction, suggesting a practical path toward industrial-grade Text-to-SQL deployment without reliance on human-curated evidence.

TL;DR: A tri-agent cross-validation framework integrates three LLMs for stable and explainable multi-model systems, demonstrating empirical success in recursive knowledge synthesis under real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance stability and explainability in multi-model large language systems through coordinated reasoning and transparency auditing.

Method: Uses three heterogeneous LLMs (semantic generation, consistency checking, transparency auditing) in a recursive interaction cycle for Recursive Knowledge Synthesis (RKS). Evaluated via 47 trials with metrics like RRS, TS, DDR, and CSR.

Result: Achieved mean RRS=0.78±0.06, TS≥0.8 in 68% trials, 89% convergence rate, showing transparency auditing as effective contraction operator.

Conclusion: The framework enables stable, safety-preserving recursive knowledge synthesis in publicly deployed environments, validated empirically.

Abstract: This paper presents a tri-agent cross-validation framework for analyzing stability and explainability in multi-model large language systems. The architecture integrates three heterogeneous LLMs-used for semantic generation, analytical consistency checking, and transparency auditing-into a recursive interaction cycle. This design induces Recursive Knowledge Synthesis (RKS), where intermediate representations are continuously refined through mutually constraining transformations irreducible to single-model behavior. Across 47 controlled trials using public-access LLM deployments (October 2025), we evaluated system stability via four metrics: Reflex Reliability Score (RRS), Transparency Score (TS), Deviation Detection Rate (DDR), and Correction Success Rate (CSR). The system achieved mean RRS = 0.78+-0.06 and maintained TS >= 0.8 in about 68% of trials. Approximately 89% of trials converged, supporting the theoretical prediction that transparency auditing acts as a contraction operator within the composite validation mapping. The contributions are threefold: (1) a structured tri-agent framework for coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs, (2) a formal RKS model grounded in fixed-point theory, and (3) empirical evaluation of inter-model stability under realistic, non-API public-access conditions. These results provide initial empirical evidence that a safety-preserving, humansupervised multi-LLM architecture can achieve stable recursive knowledge synthesis in realistic, publicly deployed environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a consistency-aware editing (CAE) framework for efficient entity-level unlearning in large language models (LLMs), improving forgetting accuracy and robustness while minimizing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risk of LLMs retaining sensitive or harmful information by enabling targeted removal of entity-level knowledge without compromising overall model performance.

Method: Introduces the CAE framework, which aggregates diverse prompts related to a target entity and learns a low-rank update guided by a consistency regularizer for robust and comprehensive unlearning.

Result: CAE outperforms traditional unlearning and editing baselines, provides insights into entity-level knowledge representation, and achieves scalable entity removal with minimal prompts.

Conclusion: CAE offers an effective and efficient solution for entity-level unlearning in LLMs, balancing robustness, accuracy, and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful information from their training data. Entity-level unlearning addresses this issue by removing all knowledge of a specific entity while preserving the model's overall capabilities. Existing approaches typically rely on full-model fine-tuning or prompt-based interventions, which can be computationally expensive or brittle when handling paraphrased queries. Recently, model editing has emerged as an efficient alternative for updating knowledge in LLMs, offering a promising direction for unlearning. However, existing editing techniques are typically designed for instance-level updates, modifying responses to specific attributes of an entity rather than eliminating all knowledge associated with the entity. In this paper, we investigate how editing techniques can be adapted for effective and efficient entity-level unlearning. To this end, we introduce a novel consistency-aware editing (CAE) framework. CAE aggregates a diverse set of prompts related to a target entity, including its attributes, relations, and adversarial paraphrases. It then jointly learns a low-rank update guided by a consistency regularizer that aligns the editing directions across prompts. This promotes robust and comprehensive forgetting while minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. We further examine where different entities are stored within the model and how many diverse prompts are needed for successful unlearning. We evaluate CAE on two challenging benchmarks, RWKU and ToFU, and demonstrate that it (i) provides insights into how entity-level knowledge is internally represented and deleted in LLMs, (ii) significantly improves forgetting accuracy and robustness over traditional unlearning and editing baselines, and (iii) enables scalable entity removal using only tens of carefully selected prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume and complexity of scientific literature require better methods for organizing and understanding research documents.

Method: A modular pipeline combining unsupervised clustering and supervised classification over multiple document representations (raw abstracts, extracted triples, hybrid formats) using transformer models (MiniLM, MPNet, SciBERT, SPECTER).

Result: Hybrid representations improved classification performance (92.6% accuracy, 0.925 macro-F1). Lightweight encoders outperformed domain-specific models in clustering, while SciBERT excelled in classification.

Conclusion: Combining unstructured text with structured knowledge offers complementary benefits for semantic organization of scientific documents.

Abstract: The increasing volume and complexity of scientific literature demand robust methods for organizing and understanding research documents. In this study, we explore how structured knowledge, specifically, subject-predicate-object triples, can enhance the clustering and classification of scientific papers. We propose a modular pipeline that combines unsupervised clustering and supervised classification over multiple document representations: raw abstracts, extracted triples, and hybrid formats that integrate both. Using a filtered arXiv corpus, we extract relational triples from abstracts and construct four text representations, which we embed using four state-of-the-art transformer models: MiniLM, MPNet, SciBERT, and SPECTER. We evaluate the resulting embeddings with KMeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN for unsupervised clustering, and fine-tune classification models for arXiv subject prediction. Our results show that full abstract text yields the most coherent clusters, but that hybrid representations incorporating triples consistently improve classification performance, reaching up to 92.6% accuracy and 0.925 macro-F1. We also find that lightweight sentence encoders (MiniLM, MPNet) outperform domain-specific models (SciBERT, SPECTER) in clustering, while SciBERT excels in structured-input classification. These findings highlight the complementary benefits of combining unstructured text with structured knowledge, offering new insights into knowledge-infused representations for semantic organization of scientific documents.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs for rubric-based short-answer grading, finding strong alignment for binary tasks but degradation with finer rubrics. It highlights trade-offs between uncertainty and accuracy and examines robustness, showing resilience to prompt injection but sensitivity to synonym substitutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to rigorously assess LLMs' reliability as judges in rubric-based grading, addressing linguistic variability and nuanced partial credit requirements.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate LLM performance using the SciEntsBank benchmark and Qwen 2.5-72B, focusing on alignment with expert judgment, consensus-based deferral mechanisms, and input robustness.

Result: Alignment with expert judgment is strong for binary tasks but weakens with rubric granularity. A 'Trust Curve' shows accuracy improves by filtering low-confidence predictions. The model resists prompt injection but is sensitive to synonym substitutions.

Conclusion: The work underscores LLMs' potential and limitations in rubric-based grading, emphasizing uncertainty estimation and robustness testing for reliable use.

Abstract: Automated short-answer grading (ASAG) remains a challenging task due to the linguistic variability of student responses and the need for nuanced, rubric-aligned partial credit. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, their reliability as automated judges in rubric-based settings requires rigorous assessment. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of LLM-judges for rubric-based short-answer grading. We investigate three key aspects: the alignment of LLM grading with expert judgment across varying rubric complexities, the trade-off between uncertainty and accuracy facilitated by a consensus-based deferral mechanism, and the model's robustness under random input perturbations and adversarial attacks. Using the SciEntsBank benchmark and Qwen 2.5-72B, we find that alignment is strong for binary tasks but degrades with increased rubric granularity. Our "Trust Curve" analysis demonstrates a clear trade-off where filtering low-confidence predictions improves accuracy on the remaining subset. Additionally, robustness experiments reveal that while the model is resilient to prompt injection, it is sensitive to synonym substitutions. Our work provides critical insights into the capabilities and limitations of rubric-conditioned LLM judges, highlighting the importance of uncertainty estimation and robustness testing for reliable deployment.

Motivation: Address the environmental concerns of LLMs by exploring SLMs as a sustainable option.

Method: Compare performance and emissions of LLMs and fine-tuned SLMs across NLP, reasoning, and programming tasks.

Result: SLMs performed comparably in 4 out of 6 tasks with significantly lower emissions.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned SLMs are viable for reducing AI's environmental impact.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their enormous carbon footprint, starting with energy-intensive training and continuing through repeated inference. This study investigates the potential of using fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) as a sustainable alternative for predefined tasks. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the performance-emissions trade-off between LLMs and fine-tuned SLMs across selected tasks under Natural Language Processing, Reasoning and Programming. Our results show that in four out of the six selected tasks, SLMs maintained comparable performances for a significant reduction in carbon emissions during inference. Our findings demonstrate the viability of smaller models in mitigating the environmental impact of resource-heavy LLMs, thus advancing towards sustainable, green AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance long-horizon reasoning in LLMs by avoiding repetitive regeneration of strategies and controlling context growth through semantic caching.

Method: Extends InftyThink with a semantic cache embedding previous reasoning patterns. Retrieves relevant lemmas at each step to guide inference without expanding context. Evaluated on MATH500, AIME2024, and GPQA-Diamond.

Result: Improves accuracy in structured tasks but exposes flaws in heterogeneous domains. Embedding analysis shows directional biases impacting performance.

Conclusion: Semantic caching aids reasoning but has limits, highlighting benefits and risks of similarity-based memory for LLMs.

Abstract: Iterative summarization based reasoning frameworks such as InftyThink enable long-horizon reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by controlling context growth, but they repeatedly regenerate similar reasoning strategies across tasks. We introduce InftyThink with Cross-Chain Memory, an extension that augments iterative reasoning with an embedding-based semantic cache of previously successful reasoning patterns. At each reasoning step, the model retrieves and conditions on the most semantically similar stored lemmas, guiding inference without expanding the context window indiscriminately. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that semantic lemma retrieval improves accuracy in structured domains while exposing failure modes in tests that include heterogeneous domains. Geometric analyses of reasoning trajectories reveal that cache retrieval induces directional biases in embedding space, leading to consistent fix (improve baseline accuracy) and break (degradation in baseline accuracy) attractors. Our results highlight both the benefits and limits of similarity-based memory for self-improving LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: RIKER is a benchmark and methodology for evaluating knowledge systems by generating documents from ground truth, enabling scalable, contamination-resistant evaluation without human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods suffer from contamination risks, biases in LLM-based judges, and costly human annotation.

Method: RIKER uses paradigm inversion—generating documents from known ground truth—to enable deterministic scoring and scalable evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 33 models shows performance degradation beyond 32K tokens, cross-document challenges, and distinctions between grounding ability and hallucination resistance.

Conclusion: RIKER offers a domain-agnostic approach for contamination-resistant evaluations where synthetic documents can be generated from structured ground truth.

Abstract: Evaluating knowledge systems (LLMs, RAG, knowledge graphs, etc) faces fundamental challenges: static benchmarks are vulnerable to contamination, LLM-based judges exhibit systematic biases, and ground truth extraction requires expensive human annotation. We present RIKER (Retrieval Intelligence and Knowledge Extraction Rating), both a benchmark and a replicable methodology based on paradigm inversion - generating documents from known ground truth rather than extracting ground truth from documents. This approach enables deterministic scoring and scalable evaluation without human annotation or reference models, and contamination resistance through regenerable corpora. Our evaluation of 33 models using over 21 billion tokens reveals that context length claims frequently exceed usable capacity, with significant degradation beyond 32K tokens; cross-document aggregation proves substantially harder than single-document extraction; and grounding ability and hallucination resistance are distinct capabilities - models excelling at finding facts that exist may still fabricate facts that do not. Beyond the specific benchmark, we contribute a domain-agnostic methodology for constructing scalable and contamination-resistant evaluations wherever synthetic documents can be generated from structured ground truth.

*Zihe Zhang,Can Zhang,Yanheng Xu,Xin Hu,Jichao Leng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PediaMind-R1 is a specialized language model for personalized parenting, using developmental psychology and a two-stage training pipeline to improve reasoning and caregiving strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of personalized suggestions in conventional systems by integrating developmental psychology and temperament theory for better caregiving.

Method: The model uses a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning for structured reasoning and GRPO-based alignment for logical consistency. It also builds a temperament knowledge graph.

Result: PediaMind-R1 accurately interprets childhood temperament profiles and engages in individualized reasoning, outperforming generic systems.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the value of combining vertical-domain modeling with psychological theory, offering a novel approach for user-centered LLMs in caregiving.

Abstract: This paper presents PediaMind-R1, a domain-specialized large language model designed to achieve active personalization in intelligent parenting scenarios. Unlike conventional systems that provide generic suggestions, PediaMind-R1 draws on insights from developmental psychology. It introduces temperament theory from the Thomas-Chess framework and builds a temperament knowledge graph for infants and toddlers (0-3 years). Our two-stage training pipeline first uses supervised fine-tuning to teach structured chain-of-thought reasoning, and then applies a GRPO-based alignment stage to reinforce logical consistency, domain expertise, and empathetic caregiving strategies. We further design an evaluation framework comprising temperament-sensitive multiple-choice tests and human assessments. The results demonstrate that PediaMind-R1 can accurately interpret early childhood temperament profiles and proactively engage in individualized reasoning. This work highlights the value of integrating vertical-domain modeling with psychological theory. It offers a novel approach to developing user-centered LLMs that advance the practice of active personalization in sensitive caregiving contexts.

*Manas Khatore,Sumana Sridharan,Kevork Sulahian,Benjamin J. Smith,Shi Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs for automated answer matching prove robust against strategic attacks like verbosity or guesswork, maintaining reliability as an alternative to human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of automated answer matching by evaluating its robustness against deceptive tactics like verbosity or guesswork.

Method: Systematically test answer matching models by prompting examinee models to generate verbose responses, multiple answers, or conflicting answers near the start.

Result: Manipulations like verbosity or conflicting answers did not inflate scores and often reduced them; binary scoring proved more robust than continuous scoring.

Conclusion: Automated answer matching is resilient to cheap text manipulations and viable as an alternative to human evaluation when reference answers exist.

Abstract: Automated answer matching, which leverages LLMs to evaluate free-text responses by comparing them to a reference answer, shows substantial promise as a scalable and aligned alternative to human evaluation. However, its reliability requires robustness against strategic attacks such as guesswork or verbosity that may artificially inflate scores without improving actual correctness. In this work, we systematically investigate whether such tactics deceive answer matching models by prompting examinee models to: (1) generate verbose responses, (2) provide multiple answers when unconfident, and (3) embed conflicting answers with the correct answer near the start of their response. Our results show that these manipulations do not increase scores and often reduce them. Additionally, binary scoring (which requires a matcher to answer with a definitive "correct" or "incorrect") is more robust to attacks than continuous scoring (which requires a matcher to determine partial correctness). These findings show that answer matching is generally robust to inexpensive text manipulation and is a viable alternative to traditional LLM-as-a-judge or human evaluation when reference answers are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated news verification methods lack schema compliance or generalize poorly across domains, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The study fine-tunes LLaMA 3.1 8B using LoRA on a dataset of 455 articles (315 for training, 80 in-domain and 60 out-of-source for testing) and evaluates performance against GPT-4o-mini.

Result: NewsScope achieves 89.4% accuracy, outperforming GPT-4o-mini on political claims (94.3% vs. 87.8%). A numeric grounding filter improves accuracy to 91.6%, with strong inter-annotator agreement (94.6%).

Conclusion: NewsScope provides a reliable and cost-effective solution for offline news claim extraction, with publicly released code and benchmarks.

Abstract: Automated news verification requires structured claim extraction, but existing approaches either lack schema compliance or generalize poorly across domains. This paper presents NewsScope, a cross-domain dataset, benchmark, and fine-tuned model for schema-grounded news claim extraction. The dataset contains 455 articles across politics, health, science/environment, and business, consisting of 395 in-domain articles and 60 out-of-source articles for generalization testing. LLaMA 3.1 8B was fine-tuned using LoRA on 315 training examples and evaluated on held-out in-domain (80 articles) and out-of-source (60 articles) test sets. Human evaluation on 400 claims shows NewsScope achieves 89.4% human-evaluated accuracy compared to GPT-4o-mini's 93.7% (p=0.07). NewsScope outperforms GPT-4o-mini on political claims (94.3% vs. 87.8%). A numeric grounding filter further improves accuracy to 91.6%, narrowing the gap to 2.1 percentage points. Inter-annotator agreement studies (160 claims) confirm labeling reliability (94.6% positive agreement on SUPPORTED judgments). The open-weight model enables offline deployment at approximately $15 on-demand compute (or $0 on free tiers). Code and benchmark are publicly released.

Additionally, we assess and compare various open-source LLMs for their performance in sustaining role consistency during virtual client interactions. Our contributions include creating an adversarial dataset, evaluating conversation coherence and persona consistency, and providing a comparative analysis of different LLMs.

*Youwei Liu,Jian Wang,Hanlin Wang,Beichen Guo,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Imagine-then-Plan (ITP), a framework combining world and policy models for multi-step imagination in agent learning, featuring an adaptive lookahead mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world model methods lack flexibility in handling complex task planning due to limited rollout horizons.

Method: ITP integrates a world model with policy learning, using multi-step imagined trajectories and adaptive lookahead.

Result: ITP outperforms baselines in benchmarks, showing enhanced reasoning and adaptability.

Conclusion: Adaptive lookahead in ITP improves agent performance and scalability for complex tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in world models have shown promise for modeling future dynamics of environmental states, enabling agents to reason and act without accessing real environments. Current methods mainly perform single-step or fixed-horizon rollouts, leaving their potential for complex task planning under-exploited. We propose Imagine-then-Plan (\texttt{ITP}), a unified framework for agent learning via lookahead imagination, where an agent's policy model interacts with the learned world model, yielding multi-step ``imagined'' trajectories. Since the imagination horizon may vary by tasks and stages, we introduce a novel adaptive lookahead mechanism by trading off the ultimate goal and task progress. The resulting imagined trajectories provide rich signals about future consequences, such as achieved progress and potential conflicts, which are fused with current observations, formulating a partially \textit{observable} and \textit{imaginable} Markov decision process to guide policy learning. We instantiate \texttt{ITP} with both training-free and reinforcement-trained variants. Extensive experiments across representative agent benchmarks demonstrate that \texttt{ITP} significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses validate that our adaptive lookahead largely enhances agents' reasoning capability, providing valuable insights into addressing broader, complex tasks.

*Pedro Memoli Buffa,Luciano Del Corro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in deploying LLMs by using output-entropy profiles to monitor performance gaps and prioritize data acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring LLM performance and improving it efficiently under domain shifts is critical for deployment.

Method: Uses output-entropy profiles from next-token probabilities to predict instance correctness and estimate domain-level accuracy.

Result: Output-entropy profiles effectively track held-out accuracy and identify underperforming domains across multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: Output-entropy profiles offer a scalable method for monitoring LLMs and guiding data acquisition.

Abstract: Deploying LLMs raises two coupled challenges: (1) monitoring - estimating where a model underperforms as traffic and domains drift - and (2) improvement - prioritizing data acquisition to close the largest performance gaps. We test whether an inference-time signal can estimate slice-level accuracy under domain shift. For each response, we compute an output-entropy profile from final-layer next-token probabilities (from top-k logprobs) and summarize it with eleven statistics. A lightweight classifier predicts instance correctness, and averaging predicted probabilities yields a domain-level accuracy estimate. We evaluate on ten STEM reasoning benchmarks with exhaustive train/test compositions (k in {1,2,3,4}; all "10 choose k" combinations), across nine LLMs from six families (3B-20B). Estimates often track held-out benchmark accuracy, and several models show near-monotonic ordering of domains. Output-entropy profiles are thus an accessible signal for scalable monitoring and for targeting data acquisition.

TL;DR: TranslateGemma enhances Gemma 3's multilingual capabilities for translation through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving strong performance across various language pairs and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve Gemma 3's multilingual translation abilities by leveraging advanced fine-tuning techniques and high-quality data.

Method: A two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised fine-tuning with synthetic and human-translated parallel data, followed by reinforcement learning using reward models.

Result: TranslateGemma outperforms Gemma 3 baselines in automatic and human evaluations across multiple language pairs and sizes.

Conclusion: TranslateGemma provides efficient, high-quality machine translation tools for the research community while retaining multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: We present TranslateGemma, a suite of open machine translation models based on the Gemma 3 foundation models. To enhance the inherent multilingual capabilities of Gemma 3 for the translation task, we employ a two-stage fine-tuning process. First, supervised fine-tuning is performed using a rich mixture of high-quality large-scale synthetic parallel data generated via state-of-the-art models and human-translated parallel data. This is followed by a reinforcement learning phase, where we optimize translation quality using an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX-QE and AutoMQM, targeting translation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TranslateGemma with human evaluation on the WMT25 test set across 10 language pairs and with automatic evaluation on the WMT24++ benchmark across 55 language pairs. Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes. Notably, smaller TranslateGemma models often achieve performance comparable to larger baseline models, offering improved efficiency. We also show that TranslateGemma models retain strong multimodal capabilities, with enhanced performance on the Vistra image translation benchmark. The release of the open TranslateGemma models aims to provide the research community with powerful and adaptable tools for machine translation.

TL;DR: A dynamic benchmarking framework using Spyfall evaluates LLMs' multilingual and multicultural capabilities, revealing performance gaps in non-English contexts and offering a leakage-resistant alternative to traditional benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static benchmarks for LLMs are prone to data saturation and leakage, prompting the need for more robust evaluation methods that assess multilingual and multicultural abilities dynamically.

Method: The paper uses the social deduction game Spyfall, where models engage in strategic dialogue to identify a secret agent or avoid detection, leveraging culturally relevant elements like locations or local foods.

Result: Game-based rankings correlate with Chatbot Arena, but non-English contexts reveal significant performance gaps in handling local specifics and strategic integrity.

Conclusion: The Spyfall-based approach is scalable, leakage-resistant, and culturally nuanced, providing a viable alternative to conventional NLP benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated more robust evaluation methods that go beyond static benchmarks, which are increasingly prone to data saturation and leakage. In this paper, we propose a dynamic benchmarking framework for evaluating multilingual and multicultural capabilities through the social deduction game Spyfall. In our setup, models must engage in strategic dialogue to either identify a secret agent or avoid detection, utilizing culturally relevant locations or local foods. Our results show that our game-based rankings align closely with the Chatbot Arena. However, we find a significant performance gap in non-English contexts: models are generally less proficient when handling locally specific entities and often struggle with rule-following or strategic integrity in non-English languages. We demonstrate that this game-based approach provides a scalable, leakage-resistant, and culturally nuanced alternative to traditional NLP benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenDecoder enhances RAG by evaluating retrieved info quality (relevance, ranking, QPP scores) for more robust generation, outperforming baselines on five datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address variability in relevance/usefulness of retrieved info in RAG to improve answer quality.

Method: Proposes OpenDecoder, integrating explicit evaluation (relevance, ranking, QPP scores) into generation.

Result: Outperforms baselines on five datasets, showing better robustness.

Conclusion: OpenDecoder is effective, flexible for LLM post-training, and adaptable to external indicators.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has achieved superior performance in a range of downstream tasks, including LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpectraQuery is a hybrid query framework integrating structured Raman spectroscopy data with unstructured literature, enabling joint reasoning across modalities via SUQL-inspired design. It achieves high SQL correctness (~80%) and grounded answers (93-97%) with expert-rated clarity (4.1-4.6/5).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to link structured experimental data with unstructured literature for scientific reasoning, which most LLM assistants lack.

Method: SpectraQuery combines semantic parsing and retrieval-augmented generation to translate open-ended questions into SQL and literature retrieval operations.

Result: ~80% SQL correctness, 93-97% grounded answers with 10-15 passages, and high expert ratings (4.1-4.6/5) for accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity.

Conclusion: Hybrid retrieval architectures like SpectraQuery effectively bridge data and discourse, supporting scientific workflows for large experimental datasets.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning increasingly requires linking structured experimental data with the unstructured literature that explains it, yet most large language model (LLM) assistants cannot reason jointly across these modalities. We introduce SpectraQuery, a hybrid natural-language query framework that integrates a relational Raman spectroscopy database with a vector-indexed scientific literature corpus using a Structured and Unstructured Query Language (SUQL)-inspired design. By combining semantic parsing with retrieval-augmented generation, SpectraQuery translates open-ended questions into coordinated SQL and literature retrieval operations, producing cited answers that unify numerical evidence with mechanistic explanation. Across SQL correctness, answer groundedness, retrieval effectiveness, and expert evaluation, SpectraQuery demonstrates strong performance: approximately 80 percent of generated SQL queries are fully correct, synthesized answers reach 93-97 percent groundedness with 10-15 retrieved passages, and battery scientists rate responses highly across accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity (4.1-4.6/5). These results show that hybrid retrieval architectures can meaningfully support scientific workflows by bridging data and discourse for high-volume experimental datasets.

*Samhita Bollepally,Aurora Sloman-Moll,Takashi Yamauchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs and humans align superficially but differ in interpreting figurative language, with GPT-4 closest to human patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how well LLMs align with human judgments in interpreting figurative and socially grounded language.

Method: Humans and four LLMs rated 240 sentences across six linguistic traits using a 10-point Likert scale.

Result: Superficial alignment between humans and LLMs, but significant divergence in figurative language interpretation; GPT-4 performed best.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with context-dependent and socio-pragmatic expressions, highlighting gaps in figurative language understanding.

Abstract: Large language models generate judgments that resemble those of humans. Yet the extent to which these models align with human judgments in interpreting figurative and socially grounded language remains uncertain. To investigate this, human participants and four instruction-tuned LLMs of different sizes (GPT-4, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2, and Mistral-7B) rated 240 dialogue-based sentences representing six linguistic traits: conventionality, sarcasm, funny, emotional, idiomacy, and slang. Each of the 240 sentences was paired with 40 interpretive questions, and both humans and LLMs rated these sentences on a 10-point Likert scale. Results indicated that humans and LLMs aligned at the surface level with humans, but diverged significantly at the representational level, especially in interpreting figurative sentences involving idioms and Gen Z slang. GPT-4 most closely approximates human representational patterns, while all models struggle with context-dependent and socio-pragmatic expressions like sarcasm, slang, and idiomacy.

*Kaiyu He,Zhang Mian,Peilin Wu,Xinya Du,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Grokked models don't acquire new reasoning paradigms but integrate memorized facts into existing paths. High accuracy and reasoning path formation can occur independently. Grokked models show limited transferability for new knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if grokked models outperform non-grokked ones and if the computational cost of grokking is justified.

Method: Mechanistic study evaluating the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer.

Result: Identical inference paths for grokked and non-grokked models; grokking integrates memorized facts into existing paths. Limited transferability in grokked models.

Conclusion: Grokking improves integration of memorized facts but doesn't fully master compositional logic. The computational cost may not always be justified.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at factual retrieval, they often struggle with the "curse of two-hop reasoning" in compositional tasks. Recent research suggests that parameter-sharing transformers can bridge this gap by forming a "Generalization Circuit" during a prolonged "grokking" phase. A fundamental question arises: Is a grokked model superior to its non-grokked counterparts on downstream tasks? Furthermore, is the extensive computational cost of waiting for the grokking phase worthwhile? In this work, we conduct a mechanistic study to evaluate the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer. We demonstrate that: (i) The inference paths established by non-grokked and grokked models for in-distribution compositional queries are identical. This suggests that the "Generalization Circuit" does not represent the sudden acquisition of a new reasoning paradigm. Instead, we argue that grokking is the process of integrating memorized atomic facts into an naturally established reasoning path. (ii) Achieving high accuracy on unseen cases after prolonged training and the formation of a certain reasoning path are not bound; they can occur independently under specific data regimes. (iii) Even a mature circuit exhibits limited transferability when integrating new knowledge, suggesting that "grokked" Transformers do not achieve a full mastery of compositional logic.

TL;DR: The paper proposes SITA, a lightweight adaptation method for pretrained speech encoders to improve tone-awareness and speaker-invariance in tonal low-resource languages like Hmong and Mandarin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tonal low-resource languages lack effective speech technology due to challenges in learning representations that balance tone-awareness and speaker invariance.

Method: SITA uses staged multi-objective training: cross-gender contrastive learning for lexical consistency, tone-repulsive loss for tone separation, and CTC-based ASR distillation.

Result: SITA improves cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy in Hmong while maintaining ASR performance and shows similar gains in Mandarin.

Conclusion: SITA is a generalizable, plug-in method for adapting multilingual speech encoders to tonal languages, addressing a critical gap in speech technology.

Abstract: Tonal low-resource languages are widely spoken yet remain underserved by modern speech technology. A key challenge is learning representations that are robust to nuisance variation such as gender while remaining tone-aware for different lexical meanings. To address this, we propose SITA, a lightweight adaptation recipe that enforces Speaker-Invariance and Tone-Awareness for pretrained wav2vec-style encoders. SITA uses staged multi-objective training: (i) a cross-gender contrastive objective encourages lexical consistency across speakers, while a tone-repulsive loss prevents tone collapse by explicitly separating same-word different-tone realizations; and (ii) an auxiliary Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based ASR objective with distillation stabilizes recognition-relevant structure. We evaluate primarily on Hmong, a highly tonal and severely under-resourced language where off-the-shelf multilingual encoders fail to represent tone effectively. On a curated Hmong word corpus, SITA improves cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy, while maintaining usable ASR accuracy relative to an ASR-adapted XLS-R teacher. We further observe similar gains when transferring the same recipe to Mandarin, suggesting SITA is a general, plug-in approach for adapting multilingual speech encoders to tonal languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient multilingual summarization and question answering without task-specific fine-tuning for low-resource languages.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: forward translation, multitask generation with a distilled model, and reverse translation.

Result: Competitive performance across nine languages, with strong win rates (e.g., 86.7% QnA for Marathi and Tamil, 80.0% for Hindi).

Conclusion: Translation-based approaches with compact models are effective for low-resource language processing.

Abstract: This paper presents team Kl33n3x's multilingual dialogue summarization and question answering system developed for the NLPAI4Health 2025 shared task. The approach employs a three-stage pipeline: forward translation from Indic languages to English, multitask text generation using a 2.55B parameter distilled language model, and reverse translation back to source languages. By leveraging knowledge distillation techniques, this work demonstrates that compact models can achieve highly competitive performance across nine languages. The system achieved strong win rates across the competition's tasks, with particularly robust performance on Marathi (86.7% QnA), Tamil (86.7% QnA), and Hindi (80.0% QnA), demonstrating the effectiveness of translation-based approaches for low-resource language processing without task-specific fine-tuning.

TL;DR: Survey on disagreement-aware NLP methods, covering sources of disagreement, modeling approaches, evaluation metrics, and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address annotator disagreement in NLP tasks by treating it as meaningful signal rather than noise.

Method: Presents taxonomy of disagreement sources, synthesizes modeling approaches, reviews evaluation metrics.

Result: Highlights shift toward modeling disagreement explicitly and capturing structured annotator relationships.

Conclusion: Identifies need for integrating variation sources, interpretability frameworks, and practical tradeoffs.

Abstract: Annotator disagreement is widespread in NLP, particularly for subjective and ambiguous tasks such as toxicity detection and stance analysis. While early approaches treated disagreement as noise to be removed, recent work increasingly models it as a meaningful signal reflecting variation in interpretation and perspective. This survey provides a unified view of disagreement-aware NLP methods. We first present a domain-agnostic taxonomy of the sources of disagreement spanning data, task, and annotator factors. We then synthesize modeling approaches using a common framework defined by prediction targets and pooling structure, highlighting a shift from consensus learning toward explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among annotators. We review evaluation metrics for both predictive performance and annotator behavior, and noting that most fairness evaluations remain descriptive rather than normative. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions, including integrating multiple sources of variation, developing disagreement-aware interpretability frameworks, and grappling with the practical tradeoffs of perspectivist modeling.

### [109] [From Symbolic to Natural-Language Relations: Rethinking Knowledge Graph Construction in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09069)
*Kanyao Han,Yushang Lai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues for shifting from symbolic relation labels in knowledge graphs (KGs) to natural-language descriptions, leveraging LLMs for more nuanced and contextual relational representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KGs use predefined symbolic relations, which oversimplify real-world nuances. LLMs enable richer, natural-language representations that better capture context and uncertainty.

Method: Proposes hybrid design principles combining minimal structural backbone with flexible natural-language descriptions for relations.

Result: Advocates for leveraging LLMs to enhance KG relations beyond traditional symbolic labels, enabling scalable and context-aware knowledge representation.

Conclusion: Encourages rethinking KG relations to align with LLM capabilities, promoting more expressive and adaptable knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have commonly been constructed using predefined symbolic relation schemas, typically implemented as categorical relation labels. This design has notable shortcomings: real-world relations are often contextual, nuanced, and sometimes uncertain, and compressing it into discrete relation labels abstracts away critical semantic detail. Nevertheless, symbolic-relation KGs remain widely used because they have been operationally effective and broadly compatible with pre-LLM downstream models and algorithms, in which KG knowledge could be retrieved or encoded into quantified features and embeddings at scale. The emergence of LLMs has reshaped how knowledge is created and consumed. LLMs support scalable synthesis of domain facts directly in concise natural language, and prompting-based inference favors context-rich free-form text over quantified representations. This position paper argues that these changes call for rethinking the representation of relations themselves rather than merely using LLMs to populate conventional schemas more efficiently. We therefore advocate moving from symbolic to natural-language relation descriptions, and we propose hybrid design principles that preserve a minimal structural backbone while enabling more flexible and context-sensitive relational representations.

### [110] [How Many Human Judgments Are Enough? Feasibility Limits of Human Preference Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09084)
*Wilson Y. Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human preference evaluations often require more judgments than typically collected to detect small improvements. Proportional allocation is optimal when preference signals are diffuse, but curated benchmarks improve detectability by reducing prompt variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how many human judgments are needed to reliably detect small improvements in generative models, highlighting the issue of underpowered evaluations.

Method: The paper analyzes large-scale human preference datasets to examine preference margins across different prompts and modalities, comparing diffuse regimes with curated benchmarks.

Result: Most comparisons show diffuse preference signals, requiring far more judgments than usual. Curated benchmarks reduce prompt variance and improve detectability by 1.5x.

Conclusion: Human evaluations often appear inconclusive due to insufficient judgments, emphasizing the importance of accounting for effect size, budget, and protocol design.

Abstract: Human preference evaluations are widely used to compare generative models, yet it remains unclear how many judgments are required to reliably detect small improvements. We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance. Our results show that inconclusive or negative human evaluation outcomes frequently reflect underpowered evaluation rather than model equivalence, underscoring the need to account explicitly for effect size, budget, and protocol design.

*Shuyang Hou,Yi Hu,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SubTokenTest is a benchmark introduced to evaluate sub-token understanding in LLMs, focusing on practical tasks across four domains, isolating tokenization failures, and assessing nine advanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' improved reasoning, they struggle with basic character-level tasks due to tokenization, which impacts real-world applications like text-based navigation or table interpretation.

Method: Developed SubTokenTest with ten tasks across four domains, decoupling tokenization failures from reasoning, and evaluated nine advanced LLMs, including test-time scaling and hidden state analysis.

Result: The benchmark highlights persistent sub-token reasoning weaknesses in LLMs and examines how character-level information is encoded in hidden states.

Conclusion: SubTokenTest provides a practical tool to assess and improve LLMs' sub-token understanding, addressing critical gaps in real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities. However, they continue to struggle with basic character-level tasks, such as counting letters in words, a problem rooted in their tokenization process. While existing benchmarks have highlighted this weakness through basic character operations, such failures are often dismissed due to lacking practical relevance. Yet, many real-world applications, such as navigating text-based maps or interpreting structured tables, rely heavily on precise sub-token understanding. In this regard, we introduce SubTokenTest, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses sub-token understanding through practical, utility-driven tasks. Our benchmark includes ten tasks across four domains and isolates tokenization-related failures by decoupling performance from complex reasoning. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of nine advanced LLMs. Additionally, we investigate the impact of test-time scaling on sub-token reasoning and explore how character-level information is encoded within the hidden states.

### [112] [Contrastive Bi-Encoder Models for Multi-Label Skill Extraction: Enhancing ESCO Ontology Matching with BERT and Attention Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09119)
*Yongming Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A zero-shot skill extraction framework using LLMs and contrastive bi-encoders achieves scalable skill mapping in job ads without manual labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the scarcity and cost of labeled data for mapping job ads to skill taxonomies, especially in non-English contexts.

Method: Uses LLMs to synthesize training data from ESCO definitions, hierarchically constrained generation, and trains a contrastive bi-encoder with BERT enhancements.

Result: Improves semantic coherence and achieves strong zero-shot performance (F1@5 = 0.72) in Chinese job ads, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, data-efficient solution for automated skill coding in labor market analysis.

Abstract: Fine-grained labor market analysis increasingly relies on mapping unstructured job advertisements to standardized skill taxonomies such as ESCO. This mapping is naturally formulated as an Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) problem, but supervised solutions are constrained by the scarcity and cost of large-scale, taxonomy-aligned annotations--especially in non-English settings where job-ad language diverges substantially from formal skill definitions. We propose a zero-shot skill extraction framework that eliminates the need for manually labeled job-ad training data. The framework uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize training instances from ESCO definitions, and introduces hierarchically constrained multi-skill generation based on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-label contexts. On top of the synthetic corpus, we train a contrastive bi-encoder that aligns job-ad sentences with ESCO skill descriptions in a shared embedding space; the encoder augments a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling to better model long, information-dense requirement statements. An upstream RoBERTa-based binary filter removes non-skill sentences to improve end-to-end precision. Experiments show that (i) hierarchy-conditioned generation improves both fluency and discriminability relative to unconstrained pairing, and (ii) the resulting multi-label model transfers effectively to real-world Chinese job advertisements, achieving strong zero-shot retrieval performance (F1@5 = 0.72) and outperforming TF--IDF and standard BERT baselines. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a scalable, data-efficient pathway for automated skill coding in labor economics and workforce analytics.

*Chen-Wei Liang,Bin Guo,Zhen-Yuan Wei,Mu-Jiang-Shan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-stage framework addressing limitations in patent claim generation: cross-jurisdictional generalization, semantic relationship modeling, and quality assessment. It outperforms existing methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems struggle with cross-jurisdictional generalization, semantic relationship modeling, and quality assessment in patent claim generation.

Method: The framework uses relationship-aware similarity analysis, domain-adaptive claim generation, and unified quality assessment with multi-head attention, dynamic LoRA adapters, and cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: Significant improvements include 7.6-point ROUGE-L gain, 8.3% BERTScore enhancement, 0.847 correlation with human experts, and 89.4% cross-jurisdictional retention.

Conclusion: The proposed framework sets a new standard for automated patent prosecution workflows.

Abstract: Current patent claim generation systems face three fundamental limitations: poor cross-jurisdictional generalization, inadequate semantic relationship modeling between claims and prior art, and unreliable quality assessment. We introduce a novel three-stage framework that addresses these challenges through relationship-aware similarity analysis, domain-adaptive claim generation, and unified quality assessment. Our approach employs multi-head attention with eight specialized heads for explicit relationship modeling, integrates curriculum learning with dynamic LoRA adapter selection across five patent domains, and implements cross-attention mechanisms between evaluation aspects for comprehensive quality assessment. Extensive experiments on USPTO HUPD dataset, EPO patent collections, and Patent-CE benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements: 7.6-point ROUGE-L gain over GPT-4o, 8.3\% BERTScore enhancement over Llama-3.1-8B, and 0.847 correlation with human experts compared to 0.623 for separate evaluation models. Our method maintains 89.4\% cross-jurisdictional performance retention versus 76.2\% for baselines, establishing a comprehensive solution for automated patent prosecution workflows.

### [114] [Identity-Robust Language Model Generation via Content Integrity Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09141)
*Miao Zhang,Kelly Chen,Md Mehrab Tanjim,Rumi Chunara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how LLM outputs degrade based on user sociodemographic attributes and proposes a training-free framework to reduce bias while maintaining content integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs exhibit identity-dependent degradation in response quality, even for objective questions, despite having robust factual knowledge. This mismatch motivates the need for identity-robust generation methods.

Method: The authors propose a lightweight, training-free framework that selectively neutralizes non-critical identity information in prompts while preserving semantically essential attributes.

Result: Experiments across four benchmarks and 18 sociodemographic identities show a 77% average reduction in identity-dependent bias compared to vanilla prompting and a 45% reduction relative to prompt-based defenses.

Conclusion: The study addresses a critical gap in mitigating the impact of user identity cues on LLM generation quality by introducing an effective, identity-robust framework.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) outputs often vary across user sociodemographic attributes, leading to disparities in factual accuracy, utility, and safety, even for objective questions where demographic information is irrelevant. Unlike prior work on stereotypical or representational bias, this paper studies identity-dependent degradation of core response quality. We show empirically that such degradation arises from biased generation behavior, despite factual knowledge being robustly encoded across identities. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework for identity-robust generation that selectively neutralizes non-critical identity information while preserving semantically essential attributes, thus maintaining output content integrity. Experiments across four benchmarks and 18 sociodemographic identities demonstrate an average 77% reduction in identity-dependent bias compared to vanilla prompting and a 45% reduction relative to prompt-based defenses. Our work addresses a critical gap in mitigating the impact of user identity cues in prompts on core generation quality.

*Zeqiang Wang,Xinyue Wu,Chenxi Li,Zixi Chen,Nishanth Sastry,Jon Johnson,Suparna De*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OrthoGeoLoRA improves LoRA by addressing geometric drawbacks (gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, rank collapse) with orthogonal constraints, outperforming standard LoRA in hierarchical concept retrieval tasks under the same low-rank budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational and energy costs of fine-tuning large language models for smaller institutions and non-profits in the Web4Good ecosystem.

Method: Introduces OrthoGeoLoRA, enforcing an SVD-like form with orthogonal constraints on low-rank factors, compatible with standard optimizers. Evaluated using a hierarchical concept retrieval benchmark over ELSST.

Result: OrthoGeoLoRA outperforms standard LoRA and other PEFT variants on ranking metrics under the same low-rank budget.

Conclusion: OrthoGeoLoRA provides a more efficient path to adapt foundation models in resource-constrained settings, addressing geometric limitations of LoRA.

Abstract: Large language models and text encoders increasingly power web-based information systems in the social sciences, including digital libraries, data catalogues, and search interfaces used by researchers, policymakers, and civil society. Full fine-tuning is often computationally and energy intensive, which can be prohibitive for smaller institutions and non-profit organizations in the Web4Good ecosystem. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces this cost by updating only a small number of parameters. We show that the standard LoRA update $ΔW = BA^\top$ has geometric drawbacks: gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, and a tendency toward rank collapse. We introduce OrthoGeoLoRA, which enforces an SVD-like form $ΔW = BΣA^\top$ by constraining the low-rank factors to be orthogonal (Stiefel manifold). A geometric reparameterization implements this constraint while remaining compatible with standard optimizers such as Adam and existing fine-tuning pipelines. We also propose a benchmark for hierarchical concept retrieval over the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), widely used to organize social science resources in digital repositories. Experiments with a multilingual sentence encoder show that OrthoGeoLoRA outperforms standard LoRA and several strong PEFT variants on ranking metrics under the same low-rank budget, offering a more compute- and parameter-efficient path to adapt foundation models in resource-constrained settings.

*Tao Liu,Taiqiang Wu,Runming Yang,Shaoning Sun,Junjie Wang,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProFit mitigates single-reference overfitting in SFT by masking low-probability tokens, outperforming traditional methods on reasoning and math tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SFT forces alignment with a single reference answer, ignoring the one-to-many nature of language and causing overfitting. Introducing multiple answers helps but is costly.

Method: ProFit masks low-probability tokens (replaceable expressions) while preserving high-probability tokens (core logic) to prevent surface-level overfitting.

Result: ProFit outperforms traditional SFT baselines on general reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: Selectively masking low-probability tokens effectively mitigates overfitting without the need for costly answer diversity.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a fundamental post-training strategy to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, traditional SFT often ignores the one-to-many nature of language by forcing alignment with a single reference answer, leading to the model overfitting to non-core expressions. Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions. Based on this insight, we propose ProFit, which selectively masks low-probability tokens to prevent surface-level overfitting. Extensive experiments confirm that ProFit consistently outperforms traditional SFT baselines on general reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.

TL;DR: UserLM-R1 addresses limitations of current user simulators by introducing dynamic profiles and goal-driven reasoning, outperforming baselines in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current user simulators lack generalizability and strategic thinking, limiting their effectiveness in diverse and adversarial scenarios.

Method: UserLM-R1 combines static and dynamic user profiles with goal-driven decision-making, enhanced by supervised fine-tuning and multi-reward reinforcement learning.

Result: UserLM-R1 surpasses baselines, especially in adversarial settings, showcasing improved reasoning and strategic capabilities.

Conclusion: UserLM-R1 offers a robust solution for user simulation, enhancing adaptability and strategic interaction.

Abstract: User simulators serve as the critical interactive environment for agent post-training, and an ideal user simulator generalizes across domains and proactively engages in negotiation by challenging or bargaining. However, current methods exhibit two issues. They rely on static and context-unaware profiles, necessitating extensive manual redesign for new scenarios, thus limiting generalizability. Moreover, they neglect human strategic thinking, leading to vulnerability to agent manipulation. To address these issues, we propose UserLM-R1, a novel user language model with reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct comprehensive user profiles with both static roles and dynamic scenario-specific goals for adaptation to diverse scenarios. Then, we propose a goal-driven decision-making policy to generate high-quality rationales before producing responses, and further refine the reasoning and improve strategic capabilities with supervised fine-tuning and multi-reward reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that UserLM-R1 outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on the more challenging adversarial set.

TL;DR: Ca2KG introduces a causality-aware calibration framework for KG-RAG models to address overconfidence issues by integrating counterfactual prompting and re-scoring, improving calibration without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG-RAG models are often overconfident, unreliable in high-stakes domains, and require better calibration methods.

Method: Proposes Ca2KG, using counterfactual prompting and panel-based re-scoring to handle uncertainties and stabilize predictions.

Result: Ca2KG improves calibration and maintains/enhances predictive accuracy in complex QA tasks.

Conclusion: Ca2KG effectively addresses overconfidence in KG-RAG models, making them more reliable for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) extends the RAG paradigm by incorporating structured knowledge from knowledge graphs, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform more precise and explainable reasoning. While KG-RAG improves factual accuracy in complex tasks, existing KG-RAG models are often severely overconfident, producing high-confidence predictions even when retrieved sub-graphs are incomplete or unreliable, which raises concerns for deployment in high-stakes domains. To address this issue, we propose Ca2KG, a Causality-aware Calibration framework for KG-RAG. Ca2KG integrates counterfactual prompting, which exposes retrieval-dependent uncertainties in knowledge quality and reasoning reliability, with a panel-based re-scoring mechanism that stabilises predictions across interventions. Extensive experiments on two complex QA datasets demonstrate that Ca2KG consistently improves calibration while maintaining or even enhancing predictive accuracy.

TL;DR: TeachPro is a multi-label learning framework analyzing teaching feedback across five key dimensions, improving reliability and granularity over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional student evaluations are unreliable and overly simplistic, while existing machine learning methods reduce feedback to binary sentiment, missing key teaching aspects.

Method: TeachPro uses a Dimension-Anchored Evidence Encoder and Cross-View Graph Synergy Network to analyze feedback syntactically and semantically, aligning it with teaching dimensions.

Result: TeachPro outperforms existing methods, providing more detailed and robust evaluations across diverse settings.

Conclusion: TeachPro enhances teaching feedback analysis by addressing limitations of current methods and offering actionable insights for instructional improvement.

Abstract: Standardized Student Evaluation of Teaching often suffer from low reliability, restricted response options, and response distortion. Existing machine learning methods that mine open-ended comments usually reduce feedback to binary sentiment, which overlooks concrete concerns such as content clarity, feedback timeliness, and instructor demeanor, and provides limited guidance for instructional improvement.We propose TeachPro, a multi-label learning framework that systematically assesses five key teaching dimensions: professional expertise, instructional behavior, pedagogical efficacy, classroom experience, and other performance metrics. We first propose a Dimension-Anchored Evidence Encoder, which integrates three core components: (i) a pre-trained text encoder that transforms qualitative feedback annotations into contextualized embeddings; (ii) a prompt module that represents five teaching dimensions as learnable semantic anchors; and (iii) a cross-attention mechanism that aligns evidence with pedagogical dimensions within a structured semantic space. We then propose a Cross-View Graph Synergy Network to represent student comments. This network comprises two components: (i) a Syntactic Branch that extracts explicit grammatical dependencies from parse trees, and (ii) a Semantic Branch that models latent conceptual relations derived from BERT-based similarity graphs. BiAffine fusion module aligns syntactic and semantic units, while a differential regularizer disentangles embeddings to encourage complementary representations. Finally, a cross-attention mechanism bridges the dimension-anchored evidence with the multi-view comment representations. We also contribute a novel benchmark dataset featuring expert qualitative annotations and multi-label scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeachPro offers superior diagnostic granularity and robustness across diverse evaluation settings.

TL;DR: FairToT is an inference-time framework improving LLM fairness in toxicity assessment by detecting demographic-related variations and applying corrective measures without altering model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inconsistencies and biases in LLM toxicity assessments, especially for implicit hate speech, to ensure fairness across demographic groups.

Method: Proposes FairToT, a prompt-guided framework with fairness indicators for inference-time adjustments.

Result: Reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable toxicity predictions.

Conclusion: FairToT offers a practical solution for fairness improvement in LLM-based toxicity assessment systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for toxicity assessment in online moderation systems, where fairness across demographic groups is essential for equitable treatment. However, LLMs often produce inconsistent toxicity judgements for subtle expressions, particularly those involving implicit hate speech, revealing underlying biases that are difficult to correct through standard training. This raises a key question that existing approaches often overlook: when should corrective mechanisms be invoked to ensure fair and reliable assessments? To address this, we propose FairToT, an inference-time framework that enhances LLM fairness through prompt-guided toxicity assessment. FairToT identifies cases where demographic-related variation is likely to occur and determines when additional assessment should be applied. In addition, we introduce two interpretable fairness indicators that detect such cases and improve inference consistency without modifying model parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FairToT reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable and reliable toxicity predictions, demonstrating that inference-time refinement offers an effective and practical approach for fairness improvement in LLM-based toxicity assessment systems.

Motivation: To bridge the gap in audio corpus exploration within Chinese Classical Studies and enhance MLLMs' audio capabilities.

Method: Proposes MCGA, a diverse audio corpus for six tasks, and evaluates ten MLLMs on its test set. Introduces new metrics for SEC and speech-text consistency.

Result: Current MLLMs face significant challenges on MCGA tasks, indicating areas for improvement.

Conclusion: MCGA and the proposed metrics aim to advance MLLMs' multidimensional audio capabilities in CCS; resources are publicly released.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their potential has garnered significant attention in Chinese Classical Studies (CCS). While existing research has primarily focused on text and visual modalities, the audio corpus within this domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-task Classical Chinese Literary Genre Audio Corpus (MCGA). It encompasses a diverse range of literary genres across six tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT), Speech Emotion Captioning (SEC), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Speech Understanding (SU), and Speech Reasoning (SR). Through the evaluation of ten MLLMs, our experimental results demonstrate that current models still face substantial challenges when processed on the MCGA test set. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation metric for SEC and a metric to measure the consistency between the speech and text capabilities of MLLMs. We release MCGA and our code to the public to facilitate the development of MLLMs with more robust multidimensional audio capabilities in CCS.

*Chaerin Lee,Sohee Park,Hyunsik Na,Daseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReGraM improves medical QA by focusing on relevant KG subsets, outperforming baselines with higher accuracy and lower hallucination rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Medical QA methods using LLMs and KGs suffer from noise and unstable reasoning due to excessive reliance on full KG traversal.

Method: ReGraM constructs query-aligned subgraphs and performs stepwise reasoning constrained to localized KG regions.

Result: ReGraM achieves significant accuracy gains (8.04% MCQ, 4.50% SAQ) and reduces hallucination by 42.9%.

Conclusion: Region-first KG reasoning enhances factual accuracy and consistency in medical QA.

Abstract: Recent studies in medical question answering (Medical QA) have actively explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve factual accuracy. However, most existing approaches still rely on traversing the entire KG or performing large-scale retrieval, which introduces substantial noise and leads to unstable multi-hop reasoning. We argue that the core challenge lies not in expanding access to knowledge, but in identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence for each query. ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that addresses this challenge by constructing a query-aligned subgraph and performing stepwise reasoning constrained to this localized region under multiple evidence aware modes. By focusing inference on only the most relevant portion of the KG, ReGraM departs from the assumption that all relations are equally useful an assumption that rarely holds in domain-specific medical settings. Experiments on seven medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that ReGraM consistently outperforms a strong baseline (KGARevion), achieving an 8.04% absolute accuracy gain on MCQ, a 4.50% gain on SAQ, and a 42.9% reduction in hallucination rate. Ablation and qualitative analyses further show that aligning region construction with hop-wise reasoning is the primary driver of these improvements. Overall, our results highlight region-first KG reasoning as an effective paradigm for improving factual accuracy and consistency in medical QA.

### [124] [Understanding or Memorizing? A Case Study of German Definite Articles in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09313)
*Jonathan Drechsel,Erisa Bytyqi,Steffen Herbold*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates whether language models rely on rule-based generalization or memorization for grammatical agreement, focusing on German definite articles using a gradient-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if language models like GPT generalize grammatical rules or memorize specific instances, particularly for German definite articles.

Method: GRADIEND, a gradient-based interpretability method, was used to analyze parameter updates for gender-case specific article transitions.

Result: Updates for specific article transitions often impacted unrelated gender-case settings, suggesting overlap in affected neurons and reliance on memorization.

Conclusion: The findings suggest models partly depend on memorized associations rather than abstract grammatical rules for German definite articles.

Abstract: Language models perform well on grammatical agreement, but it is unclear whether this reflects rule-based generalization or memorization. We study this question for German definite singular articles, whose forms depend on gender and case. Using GRADIEND, a gradient-based interpretability method, we learn parameter update directions for gender-case specific article transitions. We find that updates learned for a specific gender-case article transition frequently affect unrelated gender-case settings, with substantial overlap among the most affected neurons across settings. These results argue against a strictly rule-based encoding of German definite articles, indicating that models at least partly rely on memorized associations rather than abstract grammatical rules.

*Ewelina Gajewska,Katarzyna Budzynska,Jarosław A Chudziak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A contextualized, multi-agent framework for detecting implicitly hateful speech improves accuracy and fairness by integrating socio-cultural context and using balanced accuracy as a key metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting implicitly hateful speech by incorporating socio-cultural context and ensuring fairness across demographic groups.

Method: A multi-agent system with a Moderator Agent and dynamically constructed Community Agents, integrating publicly available socio-cultural knowledge. Performance is evaluated using balanced accuracy.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods and alternative approaches on the ToxiGen dataset, improving both accuracy and fairness.

Conclusion: The community-driven consultative framework is effective for identity-aware moderation of hateful speech, enhancing both performance and fairness.

Abstract: This work proposes a contextualised detection framework for implicitly hateful speech, implemented as a multi-agent system comprising a central Moderator Agent and dynamically constructed Community Agents representing specific demographic groups. Our approach explicitly integrates socio-cultural context from publicly available knowledge sources, enabling identity-aware moderation that surpasses state-of-the-art prompting methods (zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting) and alternative approaches on a challenging ToxiGen dataset. We enhance the technical rigour of performance evaluation by incorporating balanced accuracy as a central metric of classification fairness that accounts for the trade-off between true positive and true negative rates. We demonstrate that our community-driven consultative framework significantly improves both classification accuracy and fairness across all target groups.

*Biswesh Mohapatra,Théo Charlot,Giovanni Duca,Mayank Palan,Laurent Romary,Justine Cassell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how dialog systems can explicitly represent and use common ground in situated dialogues to improve interaction coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and enhance dialog systems' ability to establish and exploit common ground for better conversational understanding and coherence.

Method: Testing multiple methods for representing common ground and proposing approaches to improve its establishment and use in situational dialogues.

Result: Findings likely highlight effective methods for common ground representation and its practical application in dialogues.

Conclusion: Explicit representation and storage of common ground are crucial for dialog systems to truly understand and maintain coherent conversations.

Abstract: Common ground plays a critical role in situated spoken dialogues, where interlocutors must establish and maintain shared references to entities, events, and relations to sustain coherent interaction. For dialog systems, the ability to correctly ground conversational content in order to refer back to it later is particularly important. Prior studies have demonstrated that LLMs are capable of performing grounding acts such as requesting clarification or producing acknowledgments, yet relatively little work has investigated how common ground can be explicitly represented and stored for later use. Without such mechanisms, it remains unclear whether acknowledgment or clarification behaviors truly reflect a grounded understanding. In this work, we evaluate a model's ability to establish and exploit common ground through relational references to entities within the shared context in a situational dialogue. We test multiple methods for representing common ground in situated dialogues and further propose approaches to improve both the establishment of common ground and its subsequent use in the conversation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a bilingual evaluation of LLMs for clinical Relation Extraction in English and Turkish, introduces a parallel dataset, and proposes a novel retrieval method (RAR) that outperforms fine-tuned baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of annotated datasets for clinical information extraction in non-English languages and evaluate LLM-based methods beyond English.

Method: Introduces an English-Turkish parallel dataset, systematically evaluates prompting strategies (ICL, CoT), and proposes Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR) for better example selection.

Result: Prompting-based LLMs outperform fine-tuned models; English evaluations perform better than Turkish. RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash scoring 0.906 F1 in English and 0.888 in Turkish.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of quality demonstration retrieval and the potential of advanced techniques to bridge resource gaps in clinical NLP.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated datasets for clinical information extraction in non-English languages hinders the evaluation of large language model (LLM)-based methods developed primarily in English. In this study, we present the first comprehensive bilingual evaluation of LLMs for the clinical Relation Extraction (RE) task in both English and Turkish. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce the first English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset, derived and carefully curated from the 2010 i2b2/VA relation classification corpus. We systematically assess a diverse set of prompting strategies, including multiple in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, and compare their performance to fine-tuned baselines such as PURE. Furthermore, we propose Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), a novel in-context example selection method based on contrastive learning, that is specifically designed to capture both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. Our results show that prompting-based LLM approaches consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models. Moreover, evaluations for English performed better than their Turkish counterparts across all evaluated LLMs and prompting techniques. Among ICL methods, RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching a micro-F1 score of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Performance further improves to 0.918 F1 in English when RAR is combined with a structured reasoning prompt using the DeepSeek-V3 model. These findings highlight the importance of high-quality demonstration retrieval and underscore the potential of advanced retrieval and prompting techniques to bridge resource gaps in clinical natural language processing.

*Bolei Ma,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLMs understand compositional semantics or rely on surface-level patterns, using the Imperfective Paradox to test their logical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs genuinely comprehend event semantics or depend on probabilistic shortcuts.

Method: Introduces ImperfectiveNLI, a dataset probing the Imperfective Paradox, and evaluates open-weight models.

Result: Models exhibit Teleological Bias, hallucinating event completion despite negation. Prompting interventions reduce hallucinations but increase errors.

Conclusion: LLMs lack structural aspectual awareness, functioning as narrative predictors rather than logical reasoners.

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) genuinely grasp the compositional semantics of events, or do they rely on surface-level probabilistic heuristics? We investigate the Imperfective Paradox, a logical phenomenon where the past progressive aspect entails event realization for activities (e.g., running $\to$ ran) but not for accomplishments (e.g., building $\nrightarrow$ built). We introduce ImperfectiveNLI, a diagnostic dataset designed to probe this distinction across diverse semantic classes. Evaluating state-of-the-art open-weight models, we uncover a pervasive Teleological Bias: models systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, often overriding explicit textual negation. Representational analyses show that while internal embeddings often distinguish process from result, inference decisions are dominated by strong priors about goal attainment. We further find that prompting-based interventions reduce hallucinated completions but also increase incorrect rejections of valid entailments. Our findings suggest that current LLMs lack structural aspectual awareness, operating as predictive narrative engines rather than faithful logical reasoners.

TL;DR: ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer) selectively transfers ability-relevant channels in LLMs to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and integrate multiple abilities into one model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specializing large language models often leads to forgetting other capabilities; understanding how abilities are distributed helps address this.

Method: Analyze module activations to identify concentrated ability-related channels, then use ACT to transfer these channels with lightweight fine-tuning.

Result: ACT successfully recovers forgotten abilities and integrates multiple skills with minimal interference.

Conclusion: ACT offers a practical solution to preserve and merge specialized abilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models can be continually pre-trained or fine-tuned to improve performance in specific domains, languages, or skills, but this specialization often degrades other capabilities and may cause catastrophic forgetting. We investigate how abilities are distributed within LLM parameters by analyzing module activations under domain- and language-specific inputs for closely related models. Across layers and modules, we find that ability-related activations are highly concentrated in a small set of channels (typically <5\%), and these channels are largely disentangled with good sufficiency and stability. Building on these observations, we propose ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer), which localizes ability-relevant channels via activation differences and selectively transfers only the corresponding parameters, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for compatibility. Experiments on multilingual mathematical and scientific reasoning show that ACT can recover forgotten abilities while preserving retained skills. It can also merge multiple specialized models to integrate several abilities into a single model with minimal interference. Our code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: PAGER is a framework improving RAG by structuring iterative knowledge accumulation into coherent pages for better LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative RAG models lack structure, limiting comprehensive knowledge representation.

Method: PAGER uses LLMs to create structured outlines (slots) and iteratively retrieves/refines documents to fill them.

Result: PAGER outperforms RAG baselines, builds better knowledge representations, and reduces knowledge conflicts.

Conclusion: PAGER enhances LLM performance by organizing external knowledge effectively.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Recently, some works have incorporated iterative knowledge accumulation processes into RAG models to progressively accumulate and refine query-related knowledge, thereby constructing more comprehensive knowledge representations. However, these iterative processes often lack a coherent organizational structure, which limits the construction of more comprehensive and cohesive knowledge representations. To address this, we propose PAGER, a page-driven autonomous knowledge representation framework for RAG. PAGER first prompts an LLM to construct a structured cognitive outline for a given question, which consists of multiple slots representing a distinct knowledge aspect. Then, PAGER iteratively retrieves and refines relevant documents to populate each slot, ultimately constructing a coherent page that serves as contextual input for guiding answer generation. Experiments on multiple knowledge-intensive benchmarks and backbone models show that PAGER consistently outperforms all RAG baselines. Further analyses demonstrate that PAGER constructs higher-quality and information-dense knowledge representations, better mitigates knowledge conflicts, and enables LLMs to leverage external knowledge more effectively.

*Filip Trhlik,Andrew Caines,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models, as low-cost proxies for studying bias in large pre-trained language models (LMs). It shows their effectiveness in approximating bias dynamics and debiasing methods, reducing costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth and high training costs of LMs limit understanding and mitigation of biases. Current debiasing methods often fail to address root causes.

Method: BabyLMs are used to mimic bias acquisition in larger models. Their performance and bias patterns are compared to BERT, and pre-model debiasing experiments are conducted.

Result: BabyLMs closely replicate bias patterns and debiasing outcomes of BERT, reducing pre-training costs from 500+ to under 30 GPU-hours.

Conclusion: BabyLMs democratize pre-model debiasing research by enabling low-cost, accessible experimentation for fairer LMs.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (LMs) have, over the last few years, grown substantially in both societal adoption and training costs. This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores identifying and localizing conflicting knowledge within language models' internal representations using mechanistic interpretability methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unexplored problem of localizing intra-memory knowledge conflicts originating during pre-training within language models.

Method: A framework based on mechanistic interpretability methods is designed to pinpoint where and how conflicting knowledge is encoded.

Result: Specific internal components of language models encode conflicting knowledge, and mechanistic interpretability enables causal intervention and control during inference.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of conflict localization in language models and demonstrates practical intervention methods.

Abstract: In language models (LMs), intra-memory knowledge conflict largely arises when inconsistent information about the same event is encoded within the model's parametric knowledge. While prior work has primarily focused on resolving conflicts between a model's internal knowledge and external resources through approaches such as fine-tuning or knowledge editing, the problem of localizing conflicts that originate during pre-training within the model's internal representations remain unexplored. In this work, we design a framework based on mechanistic interpretability methods to identify where and how conflicting knowledge from the pre-training data is encoded within LMs. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that specific internal components of a language model are responsible for encoding conflicting knowledge from pre-training, and we demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability methods can be leveraged to causally intervene in and control conflicting knowledge at inference time.

*Ramya Keerthy Thatikonda,Jiuzhou Han,Wray Buntine,Ehsan Shareghi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve smaller LMs' ability to translate natural language to first-order logic by categorizing errors, fine-tuning with synthetic data, and using incremental inference and verification modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller LMs often fail in translating natural language to first-order logic due to formatting and translation errors, limiting their reliability in deductive reasoning tasks.

Method: Categorize common errors, fine-tune smaller LMs using synthetic data from larger models, and introduce incremental inference (predicate generation and FOL translation) with a verification module.

Result: The approach reduces error rates, increases predicate coverage, and improves reasoning performance for smaller LMs across four datasets.

Conclusion: Combining fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules enhances the reliability and accessibility of symbolic-reasoning systems for smaller LMs.

Abstract: The use of formal language for deductive logical reasoning aligns well with language models (LMs), where translating natural language (NL) into first-order logic (FOL) and employing an external solver results in a verifiable and therefore reliable reasoning system. However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems.

TL;DR: SlidesGen-Bench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating slide generation systems, focusing on universality, quantification, and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for heterogeneous slide generation systems lack comparability and often rely on uncalibrated judgments.

Method: The benchmark uses a visual-domain framework, quantitative metrics across Content, Aesthetics, and Editability, and aligns with human preferences via the Slides-Align1.5k dataset.

Result: SlidesGen-Bench aligns better with human judgment than existing evaluation pipelines.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark provides a unified and reliable framework for evaluating slide generation systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fostered diverse paradigms for automated slide generation, ranging from code-driven layouts to image-centric synthesis. However, evaluating these heterogeneous systems remains challenging, as existing protocols often struggle to provide comparable scores across architectures or rely on uncalibrated judgments. In this paper, we introduce SlidesGen-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate slide generation through a lens of three core principles: universality, quantification, and reliability. First, to establish a unified evaluation framework, we ground our analysis in the visual domain, treating terminal outputs as renderings to remain agnostic to the underlying generation method. Second, we propose a computational approach that quantitatively assesses slides across three distinct dimensions - Content, Aesthetics, and Editability - offering reproducible metrics where prior works relied on subjective or reference-dependent proxies. Finally, to ensure high correlation with human preference, we construct the Slides-Align1.5k dataset, a human preference aligned dataset covering slides from nine mainstream generation systems across seven scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that SlidesGen-Bench achieves a higher degree of alignment with human judgment than existing evaluation pipelines. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/YunqiaoYang/SlidesGen-Bench.

TL;DR: MVSS is a framework for generating structured scientific surveys by creating hierarchical trees, comparison tables, and aligned text, outperforming existing methods in organization and evidence grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survey generation methods lack explicit modeling of hierarchical relations and structured comparisons, leading to inferior structural organization compared to expert-written surveys.

Method: MVSS employs a structure-first approach: building a conceptual tree, generating comparison tables constrained by the tree, and using these structures to guide text generation.

Result: Experiments on 76 computer science topics demonstrate MVSS's superiority in organization and evidence grounding, matching expert survey quality.

Conclusion: MVSS provides a robust solution for structured survey generation, combining hierarchical and comparative representations effectively.

Abstract: Scientific surveys require not only summarizing large bodies of literature, but also organizing them into clear and coherent conceptual structures. Existing automatic survey generation methods typically focus on linear text generation and struggle to explicitly model hierarchical relations among research topics and structured methodological comparisons, resulting in gaps in structural organization compared to expert-written surveys. We propose MVSS, a multi-view structured survey generation framework that jointly generates and aligns citation-grounded hierarchical trees, structured comparison tables, and survey text. MVSS follows a structure-first paradigm: it first constructs a conceptual tree of the research domain, then generates comparison tables constrained by the tree, and finally uses both as structural constraints for text generation. This enables complementary multi-view representations across structure, comparison, and narrative. We introduce an evaluation framework assessing structural quality, comparative completeness, and citation fidelity. Experiments on 76 computer science topics show MVSS outperforms existing methods in organization and evidence grounding, achieving performance comparable to expert surveys.

TL;DR: SERM introduces multi-agent modules to address sparse informative samples and unreliable pseudo-labels in relevance models for large-scale search scenarios, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relevance models struggle to generalize in dynamic query streams due to sparse informative samples and unreliable pseudo-labels.

Method: SERM uses a multi-agent sample miner and relevance annotator to detect shifts, identify samples, and ensure label reliability.

Result: SERM shows significant performance improvements in large-scale industrial testing.

Conclusion: SERM effectively enhances relevance models through self-evolution, validated by offline and online evaluations.

Abstract: Due to the dynamically evolving nature of real-world query streams, relevance models struggle to generalize to practical search scenarios. A sophisticated solution is self-evolution techniques. However, in large-scale industrial settings with massive query streams, this technique faces two challenges: (1) informative samples are often sparse and difficult to identify, and (2) pseudo-labels generated by the current model could be unreliable. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework. We evaluate SERM in a large-scale industrial setting, which serves billions of user requests daily. Experimental results demonstrate that SERM can achieve significant performance gains through iterative self-evolution, as validated by extensive offline multilingual evaluations and online testing.

TL;DR: This paper systematically investigates post-training quantization (PTQ) under Microscaling Floating-Point (MXFP) formats, evaluating over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. Key findings highlight MXFP8's near-lossless performance, format compatibility's importance, and pre-scale optimization's effectiveness for MXFP4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unexplored applicability and behavior of PTQ algorithms under MXFP formats, focusing on their potential for large language models (LLMs).

Method: The work evaluates over 7 PTQ algorithms across 15 benchmarks and 3 LLM families, analyzing MXFP8 and MXFP4 performance, format compatibility, and quantization sensitivity.

Result: MXFP8 achieves near-lossless performance, MXFP4 introduces accuracy challenges, and pre-scale optimization mitigates MXFP4 errors. PTQ effectiveness depends on format compatibility and exhibits consistent trends across models.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidance for adapting PTQ methods to MXFP quantization, emphasizing MXFP8's benefits and solutions for MXFP4 challenges.

Abstract: Microscaling Floating-Point (MXFP) has emerged as a promising low-precision format for large language models (LLMs). Despite various post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms being proposed, they mostly focus on integer quantization, while their applicability and behavior under MXFP formats remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization.

TL;DR: Dialogue Telemetry (DT) is introduced to monitor efficiency and detect unproductive questioning in autonomous systems through Progress Estimator (PE) and Stalling Index (SI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of turn-level observables for monitoring information-gathering efficiency in autonomous dialogue systems.

Method: DT framework includes PE (quantifies residual information potential) and SI (detects repeated probing with low gain). Validated via LLM-based simulations.

Result: DT distinguishes efficient from stalled dialogues and improves RL policy performance when stalling is costly.

Conclusion: DT offers interpretable, model-agnostic signals enhancing dialogue monitoring and policy efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous systems conducting schema-grounded information-gathering dialogues face an instrumentation gap, lacking turn-level observables for monitoring acquisition efficiency and detecting when questioning becomes unproductive. We introduce Dialogue Telemetry (DT), a measurement framework that produces two model-agnostic signals after each question-answer exchange: (i) a Progress Estimator (PE) quantifying residual information potential per category (with a bits-based variant), and (ii) a Stalling Index (SI) detecting an observable failure signature characterized by repeated category probing with semantically similar, low-marginal-gain responses. SI flags this pattern without requiring causal diagnosis, supporting monitoring in settings where attributing degradation to specific causes may be impractical. We validate DT in controlled search-and-rescue (SAR)-inspired interviews using large language model (LLM)-based simulations, distinguishing efficient from stalled dialogue traces and illustrating downstream utility by integrating DT signals into a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. Across these settings, DT provides interpretable turn-level instrumentation that improves policy performance when stalling carries operational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based LLM enhancements reduce output diversity, limiting their effectiveness in open-ended tasks like creative writing.

Method: Introduces a Diverse Planning Branching method for divergence in the planning phase and a group-aware diversity reward to encourage distinct trajectories.

Result: Experiments show improved diversity in creative writing tasks without compromising quality, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances diversity and quality in LLM outputs, offering a better solution for open-ended tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based enhancement of large language models (LLMs) often leads to reduced output diversity, undermining their utility in open-ended tasks like creative writing. Current methods lack explicit mechanisms for guiding diverse exploration and instead prioritize optimization efficiency and performance over diversity. This paper proposes an RL framework structured around a semi-structured long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), in which the generation process is decomposed into explicitly planned intermediate steps. We introduce a Diverse Planning Branching method that strategically introduces divergence at the planning phase based on diversity variation, alongside a group-aware diversity reward to encourage distinct trajectories. Experimental results on creative writing benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves output diversity without compromising generation quality, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

TL;DR: A hybrid system combining LLMs with phonological algorithms improves rhyme tasks in Greek, bridging gaps in LLM reasoning and achieving 73.1% poem validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with phonologically-grounded tasks like rhyme detection/generation, especially in lower-resource languages like Modern Greek.

Method: A hybrid approach integrates LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms, featuring a taxonomy of Greek rhyme types and agentic generation with verification.

Result: Chain-of-Thought prompting boosts Claude 4.5 to 54% accuracy, while hybrid verification raises poem validity from <4% to 73.1%.

Conclusion: The hybrid system outperforms pure LLMs, demonstrating the value of combining probabilistic and deterministic methods for phonological tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities across NLP tasks, struggle with phonologically-grounded phenomena like rhyme detection and generation. This is even more evident in lower-resource languages such as Modern Greek. In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms to achieve accurate rhyme identification/analysis and generation. Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant "Reasoning Gap": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought. Most critically, pure LLM generation fails catastrophically (under 4\% valid poems), while our hybrid verification loop restores performance to 73.1\%. We release our system and a crucial, rigorously cleaned corpus of 40,000+ rhymes, derived from the Anemoskala and Interwar Poetry corpora, to support future research.

### [141] [TaxoBell: Gaussian Box Embeddings for Self-Supervised Taxonomy Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09633)
*Sahil Mishra,Srinitish Srinivasan,Srikanta Bedathur,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaxoBell introduces a Gaussian box embedding framework for taxonomy expansion, addressing limitations of existing methods like unstable gradients and lack of semantic uncertainty representation, outperforming baselines by 19% in MRR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive, and existing automated methods using point-based embeddings struggle with asymmetric 'is-a' relationships. Box embeddings face issues like unstable gradients and lack semantic uncertainty.

Method: TaxoBell uses Gaussian box embeddings, translating box geometries to multivariate Gaussian distributions (means for semantic location, covariances for uncertainty). Energy-based optimization ensures stable training and robust ambiguity modeling.

Result: TaxoBell outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines by 19% in MRR and ~25% in Recall@k across five benchmark datasets, with robust modeling of ambiguous concepts.

Conclusion: TaxoBell effectively addresses key issues in taxonomy expansion, offering stable optimization and interpretable hierarchical reasoning, validated by superior performance and thorough error analysis.

Abstract: Taxonomies form the backbone of structured knowledge representation across diverse domains, enabling applications such as e-commerce catalogs, semantic search, and biomedical discovery. Yet, manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive and cannot keep pace with the emergence of new concepts. Existing automated methods rely on point-based vector embeddings, which model symmetric similarity and thus struggle with the asymmetric "is-a" relationships that are fundamental to taxonomies. Box embeddings offer a promising alternative by enabling containment and disjointness, but they face key issues: (i) unstable gradients at the intersection boundaries, (ii) no notion of semantic uncertainty, and (iii) limited capacity to represent polysemy or ambiguity. We address these shortcomings with TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework that translates between box geometries and multivariate Gaussian distributions, where means encode semantic location and covariances encode uncertainty. Energy-based optimization yields stable optimization, robust modeling of ambiguous concepts, and interpretable hierarchical reasoning. Extensive experimentation on five benchmark datasets demonstrates that TaxoBell significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion baselines by 19% in MRR and around 25% in Recall@k. We further demonstrate the advantages and pitfalls of TaxoBell with error analysis and ablation studies.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS) framework across five languages, introduces a new Chinese dataset, and enhances rule-based WSD with neural models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of extensive evaluation for the USAS framework in WSD beyond lexical coverage or single-language studies.

Method: Creates a silver-labeled English dataset, trains/evaluates mono/multilingual neural models, and compares them to rule-based systems.

Result: Neural models enhance rule-based systems; all data, models, and code are released as open resources.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates successful integration of neural models with rule-based systems for improved WSD performance in multiple languages.

Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) has been widely evaluated using the semantic frameworks of WordNet, BabelNet, and the Oxford Dictionary of English. However, for the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS) framework, no open extensive evaluation has been performed beyond lexical coverage or single language evaluation. In this work, we perform the largest semantic tagging evaluation of the rule based system that uses the lexical resources in the USAS framework covering five different languages using four existing datasets and one novel Chinese dataset. We create a new silver labelled English dataset, to overcome the lack of manually tagged training data, that we train and evaluate various mono and multilingual neural models in both mono and cross-lingual evaluation setups with comparisons to their rule based counterparts, and show how a rule based system can be enhanced with a neural network model. The resulting neural network models, including the data they were trained on, the Chinese evaluation dataset, and all of the code have been released as open resources.

TL;DR: DeepResearchEval is an automated framework for constructing and evaluating deep research tasks using persona-driven pipelines and dynamic, fact-checking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating deep research systems are annotation-intensive, static, or unreliable in verifying facts without citations, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The framework uses persona-driven task construction with filters (Task Qualification and Search Necessity) and an agentic evaluation pipeline with Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation and Active Fact-Checking.

Result: DeepResearchEval generates realistic tasks requiring multi-source integration and provides dynamic, reliable evaluation even without citations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by automating task construction and evaluation, enhancing reliability and scalability.

Abstract: Deep research systems are widely used for multi-step web research, analysis, and cross-source synthesis, yet their evaluation remains challenging. Existing benchmarks often require annotation-intensive task construction, rely on static evaluation dimensions, or fail to reliably verify facts when citations are missing. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DeepResearchEval, an automated framework for deep research task construction and agentic evaluation. For task construction, we propose a persona-driven pipeline generating realistic, complex research tasks anchored in diverse user profiles, applying a two-stage filter Task Qualification and Search Necessity to retain only tasks requiring multi-source evidence integration and external retrieval. For evaluation, we propose an agentic pipeline with two components: an Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation that dynamically derives task-specific evaluation dimensions, criteria, and weights conditioned on each generated task, and an Active Fact-Checking that autonomously extracts and verifies report statements via web search, even when citations are missing.

TL;DR: LLM routers often lack ground-truth labeled data. RGD trains routers on generated queries and answers, revealing that query-only routers degrade slower than query-answer routers with poor generator quality. Key generator traits include accurate self-responses and performance differentiation. CASCAL, a query-only router using consensus voting and clustering, outperforms query-answer routers by 4.6% with weak data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of training LLM routers without ground-truth labeled data, especially under heterogeneous and unknown user request distributions.

Method: Introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), evaluate query-answer and query-only routers across benchmarks, and propose CASCAL—a query-only router using consensus voting and hierarchical clustering.

Result: Query-only routers degrade slower than query-answer routers with poor generator quality. CASCAL outperforms query-answer routers by 4.6% accuracy with weak generator data.

Conclusion: Effective generators must accurately respond to their own queries and differentiate model performance. CASCAL demonstrates robustness to generator quality, offering a superior solution for LLM routing.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routers dynamically select optimal models for given inputs. Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data.

### [145] [LLMs can Compress LLMs: Adaptive Pruning by Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09694)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-guided pruning uses an LLM as an adaptive agent to intelligently prune layers, improving performance and knowledge retention without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods rely on uniform heuristics and suffer from factual knowledge degradation; this work aims to address these limitations.

Method: Combines weight-activation metrics with gradient scores, processed by an LLM agent with self-reflection and rollback mechanisms.

Result: Achieves 56% better MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual retention, and 69% lower perplexity degradation at 45% sparsity.

Conclusion: Foundation models can effectively guide pruning, offering a model-agnostic, retraining-free solution.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce computational costs while preserving performance. Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation. Notably, our framework requires no retraining, operates in a model-agnostic manner, and exhibits effective self-correction with only 2-4 rollbacks across 21-40 iterations, demonstrating that foundation models can effectively guide the compression of other foundation models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Empathy Applicability Framework (EAF) to predict empathy needs in patient queries using clinical, contextual, and linguistic cues, validated by human-GPT annotations and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack clinical empathy in healthcare communication, and existing frameworks are reactive, not anticipatory, motivating the development of EAF.

Method: EAF classifies patient queries using clinical, contextual, and linguistic cues, benchmarked with human-GPT annotations and trained classifiers.

Result: Strong performance in predicting empathy applicability, outperforming baselines, with persistent challenges identified.

Conclusion: EAF enables anticipatory empathy modeling, supports empathetic communication, and highlights future needs like multi-annotator modeling and cultural diversity.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly being integrated into clinical workflows, yet they often lack clinical empathy, an essential aspect of effective doctor-patient communication. Existing NLP frameworks focus on reactively labeling empathy in doctors' responses but offer limited support for anticipatory modeling of empathy needs, especially in general health queries. We introduce the Empathy Applicability Framework (EAF), a theory-driven approach that classifies patient queries in terms of the applicability of emotional reactions and interpretations, based on clinical, contextual, and linguistic cues. We release a benchmark of real patient queries, dual-annotated by Humans and GPT-4o. In the subset with human consensus, we also observe substantial human-GPT alignment. To validate EAF, we train classifiers on human-labeled and GPT-only annotations to predict empathy applicability, achieving strong performance and outperforming the heuristic and zero-shot LLM baselines. Error analysis highlights persistent challenges: implicit distress, clinical-severity ambiguity, and contextual hardship, underscoring the need for multi-annotator modeling, clinician-in-the-loop calibration, and culturally diverse annotation. EAF provides a framework for identifying empathy needs before response generation, establishes a benchmark for anticipatory empathy modeling, and enables supporting empathetic communication in asynchronous healthcare.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the fragility of Transformer-based language models in numerical understanding by introducing a value-aware numerical representation to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models treat numbers as symbolic tokens without encoding their numerical value, leading to systematic errors in arithmetic tasks.

Method: The authors propose augmenting tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding explicitly encodes the underlying numerical value, maintaining compatibility with existing architectures.

Result: The approach outperforms baselines across various numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths.

Conclusion: Explicitly encoding numerical value enhances fundamental numerical robustness in language models efficiently.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models often achieve strong results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while remaining fragile on basic numerical understanding and arithmetic operations. A central limitation is that numbers are processed as symbolic tokens whose embeddings do not explicitly encode numerical value, leading to systematic errors. We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that augments standard tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding is explicitly conditioned on the underlying numerical value. This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures. Evaluation on arithmetic tasks shows that the proposed approach outperforms baselines across numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths. These results indicate that explicitly encoding numerical value is an effective and efficient way to improve fundamental numerical robustness in language models.

*Yanhua Zhao*

TL;DR: The paper introduces Explanation-Guided Training (EGT) to enhance interpretability and consistency in early-exit neural networks by aligning attention maps across exits, achieving high accuracy and speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-exit networks save computation but lack interpretability and feature consistency across exits, limiting trust in predictions.

Method: EGT uses attention-based regularization and an attention consistency loss to align early and final exit attention maps, optimizing both classification accuracy and consistency.

Result: EGT achieves 98.97% accuracy (matching baselines) with a 1.97x speedup and improves attention consistency by 18.5%.

Conclusion: EGT makes early-exit networks more interpretable and consistent, enhancing their suitability for explainable AI in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Early-exit neural networks enable adaptive inference by allowing predictions at intermediate layers, reducing computational cost. However, early exits often lack interpretability and may focus on different features than deeper layers, limiting trust and explainability. This paper presents Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), a multi-objective framework that improves interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks through attention-based regularization. EGT introduces an attention consistency loss that aligns early-exit attention maps with the final exit. The framework jointly optimizes classification accuracy and attention consistency through a weighted combination of losses. Experiments on a real-world image classification dataset demonstrate that EGT achieves up to 98.97% overall accuracy (matching baseline performance) with a 1.97x inference speedup through early exits, while improving attention consistency by up to 18.5% compared to baseline models. The proposed method provides more interpretable and consistent explanations across all exit points, making early-exit networks more suitable for explainable AI applications in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGFMs introduce a physics-inspired continuous-field approach for text and video generation, replacing token-based models with spectral and geometric principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of transformer-based models by grounding generation in continuous, physical dynamics for improved coherence and efficiency.

Method: Uses multiscale wavelet basis, local operators, spectral projections, and constrained stochastic dynamics inspired by Navier-Stokes.

Result: Framework unifies text/video as stochastic trajectories, ensures sparsity/stability, and departs from autoregressive/diffusion models.

Conclusion: SGFMs provide a principled, physics-based alternative for next-gen generative models with long-range coherence and multimodal flexibility.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral Generative Flow Models (SGFMs), a physics-inspired alternative to transformer-based large language models. Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.
  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models.

TL;DR: A study develops an XGBoost-based framework for forecasting Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) Index log-returns, outperforming benchmarks with optimized hyperparameters and robust validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve forecasting accuracy for daily log-returns in the NEPSE Index using advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: Engineers features like lagged log-returns and technical indicators; optimizes hyperparameters with Optuna; uses time-series cross-validation and walk-forward validation.

Result: Expanding window with 20 lags achieves lowest RMSE (0.013450), MAE (0.009814), and 65.15% directional accuracy, outperforming ARIMA and Ridge regression.

Conclusion: XGBoost effectively models nonlinear dynamics in volatile markets, providing a benchmark for NEPSE Index forecasting.

Abstract: This study develops a robust machine learning framework for one-step-ahead forecasting of daily log-returns in the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) Index using the XGBoost regressor. A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%. While the R-squared remains modest, consistent with the noisy nature of financial returns, primary emphasis is placed on relative error reduction and directional prediction. Feature importance analysis and visual inspection further enhance interpretability. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient boosting ensembles in modeling nonlinear dynamics in volatile emerging market time series and establish a reproducible benchmark for NEPSE Index forecasting.

*Shahnawaz Alam,Mohammed Abdul Rahman,Bareera Sadeqa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DriftGuard is an end-to-end system for detecting, diagnosing, and correcting concept drift in supply chain forecasting models, outperforming manual monitoring and academic methods with high recall and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chain forecasting models degrade silently due to concept drift, causing stockouts or excess inventory without warnings. Current practices are inefficient and lack comprehensive solutions.

Method: DriftGuard uses an ensemble of four detection methods, hierarchical propagation analysis, SHAP for root cause diagnosis, and cost-aware retraining.

Result: Evaluated on 30,000+ time series, DriftGuard achieves 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and up to 417x ROI.

Conclusion: DriftGuard effectively addresses the drift lifecycle, offering automated, accurate, and cost-efficient solutions for supply chain forecasting.

Abstract: Supply chain forecasting models degrade over time as real-world conditions change. Promotions shift, consumer preferences evolve, and supply disruptions alter demand patterns, causing what is known as concept drift. This silent degradation leads to stockouts or excess inventory without triggering any system warnings. Current industry practice relies on manual monitoring and scheduled retraining every 3-6 months, which wastes computational resources during stable periods while missing rapid drift events. Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models. We propose DriftGuard, a five-module framework that addresses the complete drift lifecycle. The system combines an ensemble of four complementary detection methods, namely error-based monitoring, statistical tests, autoencoder anomaly detection, and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point analysis, with hierarchical propagation analysis to identify exactly where drift occurs across product lines. Once detected, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis diagnoses the root causes, and a cost-aware retraining strategy selectively updates only the most affected models. Evaluated on over 30,000 time series from the M5 retail dataset, DriftGuard achieves 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and delivers up to 417 return on investment through targeted remediation.

TL;DR: DDDM improves molecular design diffusion models by replacing stochastic updates with deterministic denoising, analyzed theoretically via the RTK framework for efficiency and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in diffusion models for molecular design, such as long sampling times and stochastic variance, using deterministic denoising.

Method: Introduces DDDM with deterministic denoising, analyzed through the RTK framework to unify stochastic and deterministic diffusion.

Result: DDDM achieves faster convergence, higher structural fidelity, and preserves chemical validity, outperforming stochastic models.

Conclusion: The RTK framework provides theoretical clarity and practical benefits for deterministic denoising in molecular diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models for molecular design, capable of capturing complex structural distributions and achieving high fidelity in 3D molecule generation. However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset. Code, models, and datasets are publicly available in our project repository.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel fairness model for enforcing continuous group fairness at a finer granularity (block-level) within sliding windows of data streams, addressing challenges in monitoring and reordering efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure group fairness at a finer granularity within large sliding windows in data streams, which is impractical with traditional window-level fairness models.

Method: The method involves designing sketch-based data structures for real-time monitoring of block-level fairness and developing efficient algorithms for reordering windows when fairness is violated.

Result: Results show millisecond-level processing, ~30,000 queries per second throughput, and up to 95% improvement in block-level fairness, averaging 50-60%.

Conclusion: Block-level fairness is more effective than window-level fairness, achieving significant improvements with efficient, real-time processing.

Abstract: We study the problem of enforcing continuous group fairness over windows in data streams. We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach. We achieve millisecond-level processing and a throughput of approximately 30,000 queries per second on average, depending on system parameters. The stream reordering algorithm improves block-level group fairness by up to 95% in certain cases, and by 50-60% on average across datasets. A qualitative study further highlights the advantages of block-level fairness compared to window-level fairness.

TL;DR: ECOpt is a hyperparameter tuner optimizing energy efficiency and model performance, addressing gaps in energy scaling laws and actionable feedback in ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising energy consumption and environmental impact of ML models, especially during inference, motivated the development of ECOpt to provide actionable insights and compliance with regulations.

Method: ECOpt functions as a hyperparameter tuner, quantifying the trade-off between energy efficiency and model performance as an interpretable Pareto frontier.

Result: ECOpt reveals that traditional proxies for energy consumption (e.g., parameter counts) are unreliable and finds consistent energy efficiency in Transformer models. It also identifies seven state-of-the-art models for CIFAR-10 balancing accuracy and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: ECOpt highlights the importance of measuring and publishing ML energy metrics, demonstrating its potential for positive environmental impact and informed decision-making.

Abstract: The ubiquity of machine learning (ML) and the demand for ever-larger models bring an increase in energy consumption and environmental impact. However, little is known about the energy scaling laws in ML, and existing research focuses on training cost -- ignoring the larger cost of inference. Furthermore, tools for measuring the energy consumption of ML do not provide actionable feedback.
  To address these gaps, we developed Energy Consumption Optimiser (ECOpt): a hyperparameter tuner that optimises for energy efficiency and model performance. ECOpt quantifies the trade-off between these metrics as an interpretable Pareto frontier. This enables ML practitioners to make informed decisions about energy cost and environmental impact, while maximising the benefit of their models and complying with new regulations.
  Using ECOpt, we show that parameter and floating-point operation counts can be unreliable proxies for energy consumption, and observe that the energy efficiency of Transformer models for text generation is relatively consistent across hardware. These findings motivate measuring and publishing the energy metrics of ML models. We further show that ECOpt can have a net positive environmental impact and use it to uncover seven models for CIFAR-10 that improve upon the state of the art, when considering accuracy and energy efficiency together.

TL;DR: A novel Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework improves interpretability in solar energetic particle prediction by ensuring physical plausibility, outperforming baselines in proximity, sparsity, and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate solar energetic particle prediction is crucial for space safety, but existing ML models lack domain-specific feasibility constraints.

Method: Introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework for time series classification, enforcing physical plausibility.

Result: Achieves over 80% DTW reduction, higher sparsity, and 50% runtime reduction compared to DiCE, ensuring actionable explanations.

Conclusion: The framework generates valid, physically consistent counterfactuals, scalable for big data environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of solar energetic particle events is vital for safeguarding satellites, astronauts, and space-based infrastructure. Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Machine learning (ML) models trained on this data show strong predictive power, but most existing methods overlook domain-specific feasibility constraints. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains. In summary, the framework generates counterfactual explanations that are both valid and physically consistent, while laying the foundation for scalable counterfactual generation in big data environments.

### [156] [Universal Dynamics of Warmup Stable Decay: understanding WSD beyond Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09000)
*Annalisa Belloni,Lorenzo Noci,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Warmup Stable Decay (WSD) scheduler excels in training large language models, but its broader applicability is unclear. Comparing WSD paths in transformers and CNNs reveals similar optimizer behaviors, suggesting shared loss landscape geometry across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if WSD's success is unique to transformers or reveals broader insights into optimization landscape geometry, particularly in nonconvex problems.

Method: Compare WSD paths using Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model and a CNN trained on CIFAR10, analyzing training signals, optimizer paths, and sharpness dynamics.

Result: Most training signals and optimizer dynamics are similar between transformers and CNNs, indicating shared geometric characteristics in their loss landscapes.

Conclusion: The consistency suggests WSD insights may generalize across architectures, raising new questions about high-dimensional optimization geometry.

Abstract: The Warmup Stable Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler has recently become popular, largely due to its good performance and flexibility when training large language models. It remains an open question whether the remarkable performance of WSD - using a decaying learning rate for only a fraction of training compared to cosine decay - is a phenomenon specific to transformer-based language models that can potentially offer new theoretical insights into their training dynamics. Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images. We observe most training signals, optimizer path features, and sharpness dynamics to be qualitatively similar in such architectures. This consistency points to shared geometric characteristics of the loss landscapes of old and new nonconvex problems, and hints to future research questions around the geometry of high dimensional optimization problems.

### [157] [Meta-learning to Address Data Shift in Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09018)
*Samuel Myren,Nidhi Parikh,Natalie Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares traditional deep learning (TDL) with meta-learning for handling data shift in time-series classification, finding meta-learning excels in data-scarce scenarios but loses advantages as data and model size grow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of rapid performance degradation in TDL models due to data shift by exploring meta-learning's adaptability.

Method: Systematic comparison of TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning using SeisTask, a seismic benchmark.

Result: Meta-learning adapts faster and more stably in data-scarce regimes, but TDL with fine-tuning catches up as data and model capacity increase.

Conclusion: Meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift in specific conditions, and task alignment matters more than diversity alone.

Abstract: Across engineering and scientific domains, traditional deep learning (TDL) models perform well when training and test data share the same distribution. However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains. Overall, this work provides a systematic evaluation of when and why meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift and contributes SeisTask as a benchmark for advancing adaptive learning research in time-series domains.

*Shuai Jiang,Marc Salvado,Eric C. Cyr,Alena Kopaničáková,Rolf Krause,Jacob B. Schroder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new multilevel, layer-parallel training method for transformers enhances parallel scalability but introduces gradient errors. An algorithm detects and mitigates these issues, maintaining accuracy comparable to serial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of parallel scalability in training increasingly large foundational transformer models by reducing the dependency on serial layer computations.

Method: Uses a neural ODE formulation and multilevel parallel-in-time algorithm for forward and backpropagation, with an adaptive algorithm to detect and correct gradient errors.

Result: Demonstrated parallel acceleration for BERT, GPT2, ViT, and machine translation models, with accuracy comparable to serial training during fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The method successfully balances parallel scalability and accuracy, though requires adaptive control to manage gradient errors near convergence.

Abstract: We present a new training methodology for transformers using a multilevel, layer-parallel approach. Through a neural ODE formulation of transformers, our application of a multilevel parallel-in-time algorithm for the forward and backpropagation phases of training achieves parallel acceleration over the layer dimension. This dramatically enhances parallel scalability as the network depth increases, which is particularly useful for increasingly large foundational models. However, achieving this introduces errors that cause systematic bias in the gradients, which in turn reduces convergence when closer to the minima. We develop an algorithm to detect this critical transition and either switch to serial training or systematically increase the accuracy of layer-parallel training. Results, including BERT, GPT2, ViT, and machine translation architectures, demonstrate parallel-acceleration as well as accuracy commensurate with serial pre-training while fine-tuning is unaffected.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses unbounded metric movement costs in bandit online convex optimization with high-dimensional dynamic quadratic hitting costs and switching costs.

Method: Introduces SCaLE algorithm with spectral regret analysis separating eigenvalue-error and eigenbasis-perturbation driven regret.

Result: Achieves distribution-agnostic sub-linear dynamic regret without knowing hitting cost structure.

Conclusion: SCaLE shows promise in noisy bandit feedback settings, validated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: This work addresses the fundamental problem of unbounded metric movement costs in bandit online convex optimization, by considering high-dimensional dynamic quadratic hitting costs and $\ell_2$-norm switching costs in a noisy bandit feedback model. For a general class of stochastic environments, we provide the first algorithm SCaLE that provably achieves a distribution-agnostic sub-linear dynamic regret, without the knowledge of hitting cost structure. En-route, we present a novel spectral regret analysis that separately quantifies eigenvalue-error driven regret and eigenbasis-perturbation driven regret. Extensive numerical experiments, against online-learning baselines, corroborate our claims, and highlight statistical consistency of our algorithm.

*Yiming Du,Ziyu Wang,Jian Li,Rui Ning,Lusi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DIMVC-HIA is a deep learning framework for incomplete multi-view clustering, combining hierarchical imputation and alignment to handle missing data while ensuring cluster consistency and compactness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses challenges in incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC), such as accurately imputing missing views without bias and maintaining semantic consistency and cluster compactness.

Method: DIMVC-HIA uses view-specific autoencoders, hierarchical imputation with cross-view contrastive similarity, energy-based semantic alignment, and contrastive assignment alignment to achieve its goals.

Result: Experiments show superior performance under varying levels of missing data.

Conclusion: The proposed DIMVC-HIA framework effectively handles incomplete multi-view clustering by integrating hierarchical imputation and alignment modules.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) aims to discover shared cluster structures from multi-view data with partial observations. The core challenges lie in accurately imputing missing views without introducing bias, while maintaining semantic consistency across views and compactness within clusters. To address these challenges, we propose DIMVC-HIA, a novel deep IMVC framework that integrates hierarchical imputation and alignment with four key components: (1) view-specific autoencoders for latent feature extraction, coupled with a view-shared clustering predictor to produce soft cluster assignments; (2) a hierarchical imputation module that first estimates missing cluster assignments based on cross-view contrastive similarity, and then reconstructs missing features using intra-view, intra-cluster statistics; (3) an energy-based semantic alignment module, which promotes intra-cluster compactness by minimizing energy variance around low-energy cluster anchors; and (4) a contrastive assignment alignment module, which enhances cross-view consistency and encourages confident, well-separated cluster predictions. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance under varying levels of missingness.

*Parian Haghighat,Hadis Anahideh,Cynthia Rudin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses predictive multiplicity in models by proposing three methods—outlier correction, local patching, and pairwise reconciliation—to reduce inconsistency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive multiplicity (divergent predictions among equally accurate models) undermines trust in high-stakes applications, necessitating methods to ensure consistent predictions.

Method: Three approaches are introduced: (1) fixing outliers causing high variance, (2) local patching to correct biased models in specific regions, and (3) pairwise reconciliation to modify disagreeing predictions.

Result: Experiments show the methods reduce disagreement metrics without sacrificing accuracy across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches effectively mitigate predictive multiplicity, enabling the distillation of reconciled predictions into a single interpretable model for deployment.

Abstract: The existence of multiple, equally accurate models for a given predictive task leads to predictive multiplicity, where a ``Rashomon set'' of models achieve similar accuracy but diverges in their individual predictions. This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased. These three approaches can be used together or separately, and they each have distinct advantages. The reconciled predictions can then be distilled into a single interpretable model for real-world deployment. In experiments across multiple datasets, our methods reduce disagreement metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy.

*Zhoubin Kou,Zihan Chen,Jing Yang,Cong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HERON-SFL introduces a hybrid optimization framework combining zeroth-order (ZO) and first-order (FO) methods to reduce client-side computation and communication overhead in Split Federated Learning (SFL), enabling efficient training of larger models on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the significant computational and memory costs imposed on edge devices by traditional back-propagation in SFL, which limits the scalability of models.

Method: HERON-SFL integrates ZO optimization for local client training (using perturbed forward-only evaluations) and retains FO optimization on the server, eliminating activation caching and explicit gradient computation.

Result: The framework reduces client peak memory by up to 64% and compute cost by 33% per step while matching benchmark accuracy on ResNet training and LM fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: HERON-SFL effectively expands the range of models trainable on resource-limited devices by addressing scalability concerns inherent to ZO algorithms.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) enables collaborative training between resource-constrained edge devices and a compute-rich server. Communication overhead is a central issue in SFL and can be mitigated with auxiliary networks. Yet, the fundamental client-side computation challenge remains, as back-propagation requires substantial memory and computation costs, severely limiting the scale of models that edge devices can support. To enable more resource-efficient client computation and reduce the client-server communication, we propose HERON-SFL, a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for local client training while retaining first-order (FO) optimization on the server. With the assistance of auxiliary networks, ZO updates enable clients to approximate local gradients using perturbed forward-only evaluations per step, eliminating memory-intensive activation caching and avoiding explicit gradient computation in the traditional training process. Leveraging the low effective rank assumption, we theoretically prove that HERON-SFL's convergence rate is independent of model dimensionality, addressing a key scalability concern common to ZO algorithms. Empirically, on ResNet training and language model (LM) fine-tuning tasks, HERON-SFL matches benchmark accuracy while reducing client peak memory by up to 64% and client-side compute cost by up to 33% per step, substantially expanding the range of models that can be trained or adapted on resource-limited devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SRT accelerates on-policy RL for language models using a tree-structured cache for speculative decoding, reducing latency and achieving significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning in language models without compromising correctness.

Method: Uses a per-prompt tree-structured cache for storing rollouts and employs speculative decoding with online updates and proactive generation.

Result: Achieves up to 2.08x speedup in wall-clock time during rollout, reducing generation and step latency.

Conclusion: SRT effectively enhances RL efficiency for language models while maintaining correctness.

Abstract: We present Speculative Rollout with Tree-Structured Cache (SRT), a simple, model-free approach to accelerate on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for language models without sacrificing distributional correctness. SRT exploits the empirical similarity of rollouts for the same prompt across training steps by storing previously generated continuations in a per-prompt tree-structured cache. During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles. Integrated into standard RL pipelines (\textit{e.g.}, PPO, GRPO and DAPO) and multi-turn settings, SRT consistently reduces generation and step latency and lowers per-token inference cost, achieving up to 2.08x wall-clock time speedup during rollout.

*Kangda Wei,Ruihong Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO is computationally expensive due to multiple completions per prompt. MMR-GRPO uses Maximal Marginal Relevance to prioritize diverse solutions, reducing training steps by 47.9% and wall-clock time by 70.2% without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational expense of GRPO stems from redundant completions, limiting efficiency despite recent improvements in training steps. Reweighing rewards based on diversity can optimize learning signals.

Method: MMR-GRPO integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to prioritize diverse completions, reducing redundancy and enhancing learning efficiency.

Result: MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance with 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time across various models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMR-GRPO significantly improves training efficiency without sacrificing performance, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has become a standard approach for training mathematical reasoning models; however, its reliance on multiple completions per prompt makes training computationally expensive. Although recent work has reduced the number of training steps required to reach peak performance, the overall wall-clock training time often remains unchanged or even increases due to higher per-step cost. We propose MMR-GRPO, which integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to reweigh rewards based on completion diversity. Our key insight is that semantically redundant completions contribute limited marginal learning signal; prioritizing diverse solutions yields more informative updates and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across three model sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B), three GRPO variants, and five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance while requiring on average 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time. These gains are consistent across models, methods, and benchmarks. We will release our code, trained models, and experimental protocols.

TL;DR: DASD-4B-Thinking is a lightweight, open-source reasoning model outperforming larger models in benchmarks. It addresses limitations in current distillation practices and improves performance with fewer training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance reasoning models by addressing systemic limitations in sequence-level distillation, focusing on better teacher-student interaction and generalization.

Method: Proposes methodological innovations for sequence-level distillation, addressing teacher representation, alignment, and exposure bias, using only 448K training samples.

Result: DASD-4B-Thinking achieves SOTA performance among comparable open-source models, even outperforming larger models on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The improved distillation pipeline yields competitive results with fewer samples, advancing open-source reasoning models.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce DASD-4B-Thinking, a lightweight yet highly capable, fully open-source reasoning model. It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts. To support community research, we publicly release our models and the training dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STEP is a framework that improves LLM reasoning by pruning low-quality traces dynamically, reducing latency and boosting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning methods for LLMs use unreliable signals (similarity or confidence) to assess trace quality, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: STEP employs a step scorer to evaluate reasoning steps using hidden states and triggers pruning when GPU memory is saturated.

Result: Experiments show STEP cuts latency by 45%-70% and enhances reasoning accuracy compared to self-consistency.

Conclusion: STEP offers a reliable, memory-aware approach to accelerate LLM reasoning without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling by generating multiple traces. However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable prediction of concrete compressive strength is challenging due to material heterogeneity and environmental variability, necessitating advanced AI approaches for quality control.

Method: The study uses an industry-scale dataset of 70,000 tests to compare linear regression, decision trees, random forests, transformer-based and embedding-based neural networks, incorporating key mix and placement variables.

Result: Embedding-based neural networks achieve the lowest prediction error (~2.5%), comparable to lab testing variability, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: Embedding-based neural networks show promise for automated, data-driven quality control in large-scale construction, matching lab accuracy.

Abstract: Concrete is the most widely used construction material worldwide; however, reliable prediction of compressive strength remains challenging due to material heterogeneity, variable mix proportions, and sensitivity to field and environmental conditions. Recent advances in artificial intelligence enable data-driven modeling frameworks capable of supporting automated decision-making in construction quality control. This study leverages an industry-scale dataset consisting of approximately 70,000 compressive strength test records to evaluate and compare multiple predictive approaches, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, transformer-based neural networks, and embedding-based neural networks. The models incorporate key mixture design and placement variables such as water cement ratio, cementitious material content, slump, air content, temperature, and placement conditions. Results indicate that the embedding-based neural network consistently outperforms traditional machine learning and transformer-based models, achieving a mean 28-day prediction error of approximately 2.5%. This level of accuracy is comparable to routine laboratory testing variability, demonstrating the potential of embedding-based learning frameworks to enable automated, data-driven quality control and decision support in large-scale construction operations.

TL;DR: Enhanced ECG classifier addresses class imbalance and noise using wavelet transform-based feature fusion, achieving high recognition accuracies (up to 99%) on CPSC 2018 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced ECG data and noise hinder deep learning-based ECG classification, especially for rare cardiac conditions. Existing techniques lack consensus on effectiveness.

Method: Proposes wavelet transform-based feature fusion to create balanced training/test datasets by merging original data with feature libraries.

Result: Achieves recognition accuracies between 92% and 99% for various ECG categories, surpassing known algorithms on CPSC 2018 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed data fusion method effectively mitigates imbalance and noise, significantly improving ECG classification accuracy.

Abstract: Imbalanced electrocardiogram (ECG) data hampers the efficacy and resilience of algorithms in the automated processing and interpretation of cardiovascular diagnostic information, which in turn impedes deep learning-based ECG classification. Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively. Furthermore, the average recognition accuracy for these categories ranges between 92\% and 98\%. Notably, our proposed data fusion methodology surpasses any known algorithms in terms of ECG classification accuracy in the CPSC 2018 dataset.

Motivation: Financial transparency is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks for detecting evasive answers in earnings calls.

Method: A multi-model annotation framework identifies hard examples by mining disagreements between frontier LLMs, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach acts as implicit regularization.

Result: The trained model Eva-4B (4B parameters) achieves 81.3% accuracy, outperforming its base by 25 percentage points and approaching frontier LLM performance at lower inference cost.

Conclusion: Disagreement mining between models improves generalization and performance, making EvasionBench a valuable tool for financial transparency.

Abstract: Detecting evasive answers in earnings calls is critical for financial transparency, yet progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks. We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization. Our trained model Eva-4B (4B parameters) achieves 81.3 percent accuracy, outperforming its base by 25 percentage points and approaching frontier LLM performance at a fraction of inference cost.

TL;DR: DiSOL learns discrete solution procedures for PDEs in varying geometries, outperforming traditional neural operators by handling structural changes like topology shifts and boundary discontinuities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural operator learning struggles with discrete structural changes in engineering settings (e.g., topology shifts, boundary condition changes). DiSOL addresses this gap.

Method: DiSOL factorizes solvers into learnable stages: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid.

Result: DiSOL delivers stable, accurate predictions for Poisson, advection-diffusion, elasticity, and heat-conduction problems, even under out-of-distribution geometries.

Conclusion: DiSOL introduces a procedural, geometry-adaptive approach to scientific machine learning, complementing continuous operator methods.

Abstract: Neural operator learning accelerates PDE solution by approximating operators as mappings between continuous function spaces. Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning.

Knowledge Tracing (KT) is recognized for student modeling task due to its superior performance and application potential in education. To this end, we conceptualize and investigate counterfactual explanation as the connection from XAI for KT to education. Counterfactual explanations offer actionable recourse, are inherently causal and local, and easy for educational stakeholders to understand who are often non-experts. We propose KTCF, a counterfactual explanation generation method for KT that accounts for knowledge concept relationships, and a post-processing scheme that converts a counterfactual explanation into a sequence of educational instructions. We experiment on a large-scale educational dataset and show our KTCF method achieves superior and robust performance over existing methods, with improvements ranging from 5.7% to 34% across metrics. Additionally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our post-processing scheme, demonstrating that the resulting educational instructions help in reducing large study burden. We show that counterfactuals have the potential to advance the responsible and practical use of AI in education. Future works on XAI for KT may benefit from educationally grounded conceptualization and developing stakeholder-centered methods.

### [172] [Efficient Clustering in Stochastic Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09162)
*G Dhinesh Chandran,Kota Srinivas Reddy,Srikrishna Bhashyam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Efficient Bandit Clustering (EBC) and its heuristic variant EBC-H, which address the Bandit Clustering problem under fixed confidence settings. Unlike existing methods, EBC and EBC-H avoid costly optimization steps while maintaining asymptotic optimality and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bandit Clustering algorithms are computationally expensive due to solving optimization problems at each step. The authors aim to develop efficient alternatives (EBC and EBC-H) that reduce computational costs without sacrificing performance.

Method: EBC avoids full optimization by taking incremental steps toward optimality at each time step. EBC-H further simplifies arm selection using quantities from the stopping rule. Both algorithms are evaluated for computational efficiency and performance.

Result: Simulations show EBC and EBC-H are computationally faster than existing methods while maintaining asymptotic optimality. They also outperform other approaches in performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: EBC and EBC-H provide efficient and asymptotically optimal solutions for Bandit Clustering, reducing computational overhead compared to existing algorithms while delivering competitive performance.

Abstract: We study the Bandit Clustering (BC) problem under the fixed confidence setting, where the objective is to group a collection of data sequences (arms) into clusters through sequential sampling from adaptively selected arms at each time step while ensuring a fixed error probability at the stopping time. We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets. Through simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show the performance gain of EBC and EBC-H over existing approaches.

*Aaron R. Flouro,Shawn P. Chadwick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an axiomatic framework for multi-teacher knowledge distillation, ensuring valid aggregation operators and providing theoretical guarantees for variance and bias reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to develop a principled, operator-theoretic framework for multi-teacher ensemble knowledge distillation, avoiding ad-hoc aggregation methods.

Method: The authors define five core axioms governing valid aggregation operators and prove their existence and non-uniqueness. Theoretical guarantees are provided for variance and bias reduction.

Result: The framework shows that multi-teacher aggregation reduces stochastic variance and supervisory bias, offering Jensen-type bounds and log-loss guarantees.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical grounding for multi-teacher distillation, accommodating diverse implementation strategies while adhering to foundational principles.

Abstract: Building on the probability-domain distillation framework of Sparse-KD, we develop an axiomatic, operator-theoretic framework for multi-teacher ensemble knowledge distillation. Rather than prescribing a specific aggregation formula, we define five core axioms governing valid knowledge aggregation operators, encompassing convexity, positivity, continuity, weight monotonicity, and temperature coherence. We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.
  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes. The framework provides theoretical grounding for multi-teacher distillation from diverse frontier models while admitting multiple valid implementation strategies.

*Sidhant R. Nair,Tanmay Sen,Mrinmay Sen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-FedSOFIM is a server-side second-order optimization framework for federated learning with differential privacy, offering efficient memory usage (O(d)) and faster convergence compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The slow convergence of differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) under tight privacy budgets and the impractical memory requirements of existing second-order methods motivate the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: DP-FedSOFIM leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner, uses the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, and requires only O(d) memory per client.

Result: Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10 show that DP-FedSOFIM achieves superior test accuracy compared to first-order baselines across multiple privacy regimes.

Conclusion: DP-FedSOFIM effectively balances privacy, efficiency, and performance, making it a practical solution for high-dimensional models in DP-FL.

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) suffers from slow convergence under tight privacy budgets due to the overwhelming noise introduced to preserve privacy. While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem. Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that DP-FedSOFIM achieves superior test accuracy compared to first-order baselines across multiple privacy regimes.

### [175] [BalDRO: A Distributionally Robust Optimization based Framework for Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09172)
*Pengyang Shao,Naixin Zhai,Lei Chen,Yonghui Yang,Fengbin Zhu,Xun Yang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BalDRO is a novel framework addressing sample-wise imbalance in LLM unlearning by using a min-sup process, improving forgetting quality and model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of removing targeted information from LLMs due to varying unlearning difficulty necessitates a balanced approach.

Method: BalDRO uses a min-sup process with inner steps emphasizing hard-to-unlearn samples and outer steps updating parameters under this distribution.

Result: BalDRO outperforms existing methods in forgetting quality and model utility, validated on TOFU and MUSE datasets.

Conclusion: BalDRO provides an efficient and balanced solution for LLM unlearning, addressing asynchronous forgetting issues.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape online content, removing targeted information from well-trained LLMs (also known as LLM unlearning) has become critical for web governance. A key challenge lies in sample-wise imbalance within the forget set: different samples exhibit widely varying unlearning difficulty, leading to asynchronous forgetting where some knowledge remains insufficiently erased while others become over-forgotten. To address this, we propose BalDRO, a novel and efficient framework for balanced LLM unlearning. BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility.

### [176] [Geometric Stability: The Missing Axis of Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09173)
*Prashant C. Raju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces geometric stability as a new dimension to analyze learned representations, distinct from similarity, and demonstrates its practical utility across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current analysis of learned representations focuses on similarity, which reveals what is represented but not its robustness. The paper aims to address this gap by introducing geometric stability.

Method: The authors propose Shesha, a framework to measure geometric stability, which quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation. They test it across 2,463 configurations in seven domains.

Result: Results show geometric stability and similarity are uncorrelated (~0.01). Stability detects structural drift more sensitively than CKA and predicts linear steerability (~0.89-0.96). It also dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric trade-off.

Conclusion: Geometric stability complements similarity for auditing representations, offering actionable insights for safety, controllability, and model selection across biological and computational systems.

Abstract: Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($ρ\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($ρ= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling. By quantifying $how$ $reliably$ systems maintain structure, geometric stability provides a necessary complement to similarity for auditing representations across biological and computational systems.

*Lang Xiong,Ning Liu,Ao Ren,Yuheng Bai,Haining Fang,BinYan Zhang,Zhe Jiang,Yujuan Tan,Duo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces $D^2Prune$, a novel pruning method for LLMs that addresses limitations in existing pruning techniques by jointly modeling weight and activation perturbations and preserving long-tail attention patterns. It outperforms SOTA methods across various models and generalizes to ViT-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods neglect activation distribution shifts and long-tail attention patterns, leading to inaccurate error estimations and suboptimal pruning.

Method: Proposes $D^2Prune$, which uses dual Taylor expansion for precise error estimation and an attention-aware dynamic update strategy to preserve long-tail patterns.

Result: $D^2Prune$ outperforms SOTA methods across LLMs like OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3, and generalizes to ViT models like DeiT on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: $D^2Prune$ effectively addresses pruning challenges in LLMs by optimizing error estimation and attention preservation, achieving superior performance across diverse models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their massive computational demands. % While pruning offers a promising compression solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) They neglect activation distribution shifts between calibration data and test data, resulting in inaccurate error estimations; (2) They overlook the long-tail distribution characteristics of activations in the attention module. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel pruning method, $D^2Prune$. First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error. Extensive experiments show that $D^2Prune$ consistently outperforms SOTA methods across various LLMs (e.g., OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3). Moreover, the dynamic attention update mechanism also generalizes well to ViT-based vision models like DeiT, achieving superior accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

*Xinzi Tan,Kejian Zhang,Junhan Yu,Doudou Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hawkes Attention is a novel attention operator inspired by Hawkes process theory, designed to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects in MTPPs, outperforming traditional Transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer-based methods for MTPPs inadequately capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects due to reliance on shared or parametric decay structures.

Method: Derived Hawkes Attention from Hawkes process theory, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key, and value projections in attention mechanisms.

Result: Hawkes Attention achieves better performance than baselines by unifying event timing and content interaction, learning time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns.

Conclusion: Hawkes Attention effectively addresses limitations in existing MTPP methods and can be extended to other temporal structures like time series forecasting.

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) arise naturally in medical, social, commercial, and financial domains. However, existing Transformer-based methods mostly inject temporal information only via positional encodings, relying on shared or parametric decay structures, which limits their ability to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects. Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GIFT reformulates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) within a unified post-training framework to address optimization mismatch in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). It introduces finite-temperature energy potential to maintain exploration space for Reinforcement Learning (RL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current SFT-RL pipeline suffers from distributional collapse due to rigid supervision, limiting exploration space for RL. This mismatch hinders achieving global optimality.

Method: Proposes Gibbs Initialization with Finite Temperature (GIFT), replacing standard SFT's zero-temperature limit with finite-temperature energy potential to preserve base priors and ensure objective consistency.

Result: GIFT outperforms standard SFT and other baselines in RL initialization, demonstrating improved optimization and performance.

Conclusion: GIFT provides a principled solution to the optimization mismatch in LRMs, offering a pathway to global optimality in post-training.

Abstract: The prevailing post-training paradigm for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)--Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL)--suffers from an intrinsic optimization mismatch: the rigid supervision inherent in SFT induces distributional collapse, thereby exhausting the exploration space necessary for subsequent RL. In this paper, we reformulate SFT within a unified post-training framework and propose Gibbs Initialization with Finite Temperature (GIFT). We characterize standard SFT as a degenerate zero-temperature limit that suppresses base priors. Conversely, GIFT incorporates supervision as a finite-temperature energy potential, establishing a distributional bridge that ensures objective consistency throughout the post-training pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that GIFT significantly outperforms standard SFT and other competitive baselines when utilized for RL initialization, providing a mathematically principled pathway toward achieving global optimality in post-training.

*Chaitanya Kharyal,Calarina Muslimani,Matthew E. Taylor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R4 is a new rating-based reinforcement learning method that uses a ranking mean squared error loss to learn from human-provided ratings, offering formal guarantees and outperforming existing methods with less feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward design is a bottleneck in RL applications; reward learning from human feedback is a promising alternative, especially with richer ratings instead of binary preferences.

Method: R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, sampling trajectory-rating pairs and optimizing predicted returns against teacher ratings using soft ranks.

Result: R4 matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on benchmarks, requiring significantly less human feedback.

Conclusion: R4 provides a provably minimal and complete solution for rating-based RL, demonstrating effectiveness and efficiency in learning from human feedback.

Abstract: Reward design remains a significant bottleneck in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems. A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., "bad," "neutral," "good"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.

*Xinyang Chen,Huidong Jin,Yu Huang,Zaiwen Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XLinear, a lightweight MLP-based model, improves time series forecasting by efficiently integrating asymmetric causal relationships and exogenous data, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications often feature asymmetric causal relationships and varying data acquisition costs, which are overlooked by uniform variable importance assumptions in existing models. Exogenous data can significantly influence endogenous variables, and efficiently capturing these relationships is key.

Method: XLinear uses MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. It employs a global token from endogenous variables as a hub for interacting with exogenous variables and integrates these signals for forecasting.

Result: XLinear outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy and efficiency across seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs.

Conclusion: XLinear effectively addresses the limitations of transformer and patch-based models by leveraging MLPs, offering superior performance in forecasting tasks involving exogenous data.

Abstract: Despite the prevalent assumption of uniform variable importance in long-term time series forecasting models, real world applications often exhibit asymmetric causal relationships and varying data acquisition costs. Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs. Compared with state-of-the-art models, XLinear delivers superior accuracy and efficiency for both multivariate forecasts and univariate forecasts influenced by exogenous inputs.

TL;DR: HGATSolver proposes a heterogeneous graph-based approach with specialized message-passing and physics-conditioned gating for stable and accurate surrogate modeling of fluid-structure interaction systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based solvers fail to capture the heterogeneous dynamics of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems within a unified framework, leading to instability and inconsistencies.

Method: HGATSolver encodes FSI systems as heterogeneous graphs with distinct node and edge types, employs specialized message-passing mechanisms, a physics-conditioned gating mechanism for stability, and an Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss.

Result: HGATSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance on two FSI benchmarks and a public dataset, demonstrating effectiveness for coupled multi-physics systems.

Conclusion: HGATSolver provides a robust framework for surrogate modeling of FSI systems, addressing domain-specific challenges and improving stability and accuracy.

Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems involve distinct physical domains, fluid and solid, governed by different partial differential equations and coupled at a dynamic interface. While learning-based solvers offer a promising alternative to costly numerical simulations, existing methods struggle to capture the heterogeneous dynamics of FSI within a unified framework. This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions. This enables specialized message-passing mechanisms tailored to each physical domain. To stabilize explicit time stepping, we introduce a novel physics-conditioned gating mechanism that serves as a learnable, adaptive relaxation factor. Furthermore, an Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss dynamically balances the optimization objectives across domains based on predictive uncertainty. Extensive experiments on two constructed FSI benchmarks and a public dataset demonstrate that HGATSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing an effective framework for surrogate modeling of coupled multi-physics systems.

TL;DR: RIFT is a framework for LLM alignment that efficiently uses all self-generated samples by reweighting loss with scalar rewards, outperforming RFT in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve data efficiency in LLM alignment by avoiding reliance on costly expert data or discarding negative samples, common drawbacks of SFT and RFT.

Method: Introduces Reward Informed Fine-Tuning (RIFT), which repurposes negative trajectories by reweighting loss with rewards and a stabilized loss formulation to prevent training collapse.

Result: RIFT consistently outperforms RFT in mathematical benchmarks across various base models.

Conclusion: RIFT is a robust, data-efficient alternative for alignment using mixed-quality, self-generated data.

Abstract: While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) are standard for LLM alignment, they either rely on costly expert data or discard valuable negative samples, leading to data inefficiency. To address this, we propose Reward Informed Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a simple yet effective framework that utilizes all self-generated samples. Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs. To overcome the training collapse caused by naive reward integration, where direct multiplication yields an unbounded loss, we introduce a stabilized loss formulation that ensures numerical robustness and optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks across various base models show that RIFT consistently outperforms RFT. Our results demonstrate that RIFT is a robust and data-efficient alternative for alignment using mixed-quality, self-generated data.

*Zhipeng Zhang,Zhenjie Yao,Kai Li,Lei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses learning challenges when feedback reliability is unobservable, proposing metacognitive regulation via a Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) framework to infer credibility internally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the problem of learning under unobservable feedback reliability, where standard methods may form incorrect high-confidence beliefs.

Method: Introduces MTR decomposition with self-diagnosis, modulating learning updates based on endogenous evidence without external reliability labels.

Result: Self-diagnosis improves epistemic identifiability, enabling calibrated skepticism in reinforcement learning and revealing belief dynamics issues in supervised learning.

Conclusion: MTR and self-diagnosis offer a practical approach for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning systems.

Abstract: Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.
  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.
  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting the 3D structures of MOFs is challenging due to their high atomic complexity, despite their broad applications in areas like carbon capture and drug delivery.

Method: MOF-LLM combines spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL), optimized via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO).

Result: MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: The introduced MOF-LLM framework effectively adapts LLMs for MOF structure prediction, enhancing spatial reasoning and structural stability.

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with broad applications such as carbon capture and drug delivery, yet accurately predicting their 3D structures remains a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: DC-CFL is a single-round federated learning framework that improves performance in non-IID data scenarios by clustering clients and training cluster-wise models efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of multi-round communication in existing clustered federated learning (CFL) methods, which are impractical under tight communication constraints.

Method: Uses Data Collaboration (DC) analysis to estimate client clusters in one round, quantifies similarity via total variation distance between label distributions, and performs hierarchical clustering for model training.

Result: DC-CFL achieves comparable accuracy to multi-round baselines while requiring only one communication round.

Conclusion: DC-CFL is a practical solution for scenarios where multiple communication rounds are not feasible, offering efficient collaborative AI model development.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed learning across multiple clients without sharing raw data. When statistical heterogeneity across clients is severe, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) can improve performance by grouping similar clients and training cluster-wise models. However, most CFL approaches rely on multiple communication rounds for cluster estimation and model updates, which limits their practicality under tight constraints on communication rounds. We propose Data Collaboration-based Clustered Federated Learning (DC-CFL), a single-round framework that completes both client clustering and cluster-wise learning, using only the information shared in DC analysis. DC-CFL quantifies inter-client similarity via total variation distance between label distributions, estimates clusters using hierarchical clustering, and performs cluster-wise learning via DC analysis. Experiments on multiple open datasets under representative non-IID conditions show that DC-CFL achieves accuracy comparable to multi-round baselines while requiring only one communication round. These results indicate that DC-CFL is a practical alternative for collaborative AI model development when multiple communication rounds are impractical.

*Jiaying Zhang,Lei Shi,Jiguo Li,Jun Xu,Jiuchong Gao,Jinghua Hao,Renqing He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoRA, a geometry-aware low-rank adaptation method, addresses inefficiencies and instability in RLVR by leveraging anisotropic update subspaces and preserving pre-trained geometric structures, achieving SOTA results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter-efficient methods like PiSSA and MiLoRA are unsuitable for RLVR due to spectral collapse and optimization instability, while alternative sparse methods face hardware efficiency bottlenecks.

Method: GeoRA uses SVD to initialize adapters within geometrically constrained subspaces, freezing residual components to maintain pre-trained structures and enable efficient GPU computation.

Result: GeoRA outperforms baselines on mathematical benchmarks, shows resilience to catastrophic forgetting, and achieves SOTA performance.

Conclusion: GeoRA effectively addresses RLVR challenges by aligning optimization dynamics with geometric constraints, offering superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is crucial for advancing large-scale reasoning models. However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACS2HER integrates ACS2 with HER to improve performance in sparse-reward environments by re-labeling states as virtual goals, showing faster learning but higher computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACS2 struggles with sparse rewards, so integrating HER could enhance its learning efficiency by densifying rewards through hindsight.

Method: ACS2HER triggers HER when goals aren't met, re-labeling states as virtual goals. Tested on Maze 6 and FrozenLake benchmarks.

Result: ACS2HER accelerates learning and mastery vs. ACS2 but increases computational overhead and classifier numerosity.

Conclusion: Combining anticipatory mechanisms with HER in LCS shows promise but trades efficiency for computational cost.

Abstract: This paper introduces ACS2HER, a novel integration of the Anticipatory Classifier System (ACS2) with the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism. While ACS2 is highly effective at building cognitive maps through latent learning, its performance often stagnates in environments characterized by sparse rewards. We propose a specific architectural variant that triggers hindsight learning when the agent fails to reach its primary goal, re-labeling visited states as virtual goals to densify the learning signal. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmarks: the deterministic \texttt{Maze 6} and the stochastic \texttt{FrozenLake}. The results demonstrate that ACS2HER significantly accelerates knowledge acquisition and environmental mastery compared to the standard ACS2. However, this efficiency gain is accompanied by increased computational overhead and a substantial expansion in classifier numerosity. This work provides the first analysis of combining anticipatory mechanisms with retrospective goal-relabeling in Learning Classifier Systems.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for generating CAD profiles using geometric constructions like curve offsetting, rotations, and intersections. It highlights improved quality through intermediate construction steps and reinforcement learning, enabling parametric editing with precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance CAD profile generation by mimicking chain-of-thought reasoning in language models and enabling parametric editing with high precision.

Method: Uses geometric constructions (e.g., curve offsetting, rotations, intersections) starting from designer input. Incorporates reinforcement learning to optimize sequences.

Result: Improved generation quality and parametric editing capabilities, with reinforcement learning further enhancing performance across metrics.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges designer input and final profiles, offering precision and flexibility through construction sequences and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: We introduce a new method of generating Computer Aided Design (CAD) profiles via a sequence of simple geometric constructions including curve offsetting, rotations and intersections. These sequences start with geometry provided by a designer and build up the points and curves of the final profile step by step. We demonstrate that adding construction steps between the designer's input geometry and the final profile improves generation quality in a similar way to the introduction of a chain of thought in language models. Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision. In addition we show that applying reinforcement learning to the construction sequences gives further improvements over a wide range of metrics, including some which were not explicitly optimized.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sobolev training for neural surrogate models in optoacoustic imaging to improve derivative accuracy and generalization, enhancing reconstruction fidelity in inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate inversion of light transport to recover tissue absorption coefficients is challenging but crucial for clinical optoacoustic imaging. Existing methods rely on differentiable models, but neural surrogates lack derivative accuracy guarantees, hindering reconstructions.

Method: The authors introduce Sobolev training for neural surrogate models of light transport in tissue, ensuring accurate derivatives and suitability for high-dimensional models.

Result: Sobolev training improves derivative accuracy and reduces generalization error for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples.

Conclusion: The enhanced surrogate model promises significant utility in solving inverse problems, potentially advancing optoacoustic imaging applications.

Abstract: In optoacoustic imaging, recovering the absorption coefficients of tissue by inverting the light transport remains a challenging problem. Improvements in solving this problem can greatly benefit the clinical value of optoacoustic imaging. Existing variational inversion methods require an accurate and differentiable model of this light transport. As neural surrogate models allow fast and differentiable simulations of complex physical processes, they are considered promising candidates to be used in solving such inverse problems. However, there are in general no guarantees that the derivatives of these surrogate models accurately match those of the underlying physical operator. As accurate derivatives are central to solving inverse problems, errors in the model derivative can considerably hinder high fidelity reconstructions. To overcome this limitation, we present a surrogate model for light transport in tissue that uses Sobolev training to improve the accuracy of the model derivatives. Additionally, the form of Sobolev training we used is suitable for high-dimensional models in general. Our results demonstrate that Sobolev training for a light transport surrogate model not only improves derivative accuracy but also reduces generalization error for in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. These improvements promise to considerably enhance the utility of the surrogate model in downstream tasks, especially in solving inverse problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the computational challenges in generating explanations for ML models, emphasizing their importance in critical applications.

Method: Reviewing existing computational complexity literature and contributing new inapproximability results.

Result: Explanations are computationally hard to generate and, under certain conditions, hard to approximate.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for the XAI community and policymakers to address computational challenges when mandating or using explanations.

Abstract: Providing clear explanations to the choices of machine learning models is essential for these models to be deployed in crucial applications. Counterfactual and semi-factual explanations have emerged as two mechanisms for providing users with insights into the outputs of their models. We provide an overview of the computational complexity results in the literature for generating these explanations, finding that in many cases, generating explanations is computationally hard. We strengthen the argument for this considerably by further contributing our own inapproximability results showing that not only are explanations often hard to generate, but under certain assumptions, they are also hard to approximate. We discuss the implications of these complexity results for the XAI community and for policymakers seeking to regulate explanations in AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer-based weather models ignore Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity, and autoregressive training suffers from computational inefficiency and error accumulation.

Method: Develops a physics-informed Transformer architecture (Searth Transformer) incorporating zonal periodicity and introduces RAR fine-tuning for efficient long-range atmospheric modeling.

Result: YanTian outperforms ECMWF's high-resolution forecast and competes with AI models at lower cost, achieving a 10.3-day skillful forecast lead time for Z500.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust foundation for global-scale geophysical modeling, advancing Earth system science.

Abstract: Accurate global medium-range weather forecasting is fundamental to Earth system science. Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science.

TL;DR: FairGU is a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework that improves both utility and fairness in social networks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph unlearning techniques fail to protect sensitive attributes adequately, leading to fairness degradation.

Method: FairGU integrates a fairness-aware module with data protection strategies to handle sensitive attributes during node removal.

Result: FairGU outperforms current unlearning and fairness-enhanced learning methods in accuracy and fairness metrics.

Conclusion: FairGU addresses overlooked fairness risks in unlearning and offers a robust solution for sustainable networked systems.

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a critical mechanism for supporting sustainable and privacy-preserving social networks, enabling models to remove the influence of deleted nodes and thereby better safeguard user information. However, we observe that existing graph unlearning techniques insufficiently protect sensitive attributes, often leading to degraded algorithmic fairness compared with traditional graph learning methods. To address this gap, we introduce FairGU, a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework designed to preserve both utility and fairness during the unlearning process. FairGU integrates a dedicated fairness-aware module with effective data protection strategies, ensuring that sensitive attributes are neither inadvertently amplified nor structurally exposed when nodes are removed. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FairGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning methods and fairness-enhanced graph learning baselines in terms of both accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings highlight a previously overlooked risk in current unlearning practices and establish FairGU as a robust and equitable solution for the next generation of socially sustainable networked systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model merging combines multiple LLMs efficiently, but selection and evaluation can be costly. SimMerge predicts the best merge using inexpensive similarity signals, outperforming standard methods and scaling to larger models without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model merging requires costly evaluations to select the best merge. SimMerge aims to reduce this expense by using predictive signals.

Method: SimMerge uses task-agnostic similarity signals from unlabeled probes to predict merge performance, eliminating expensive evaluations.

Result: SimMerge outperforms standard merging on 7B-parameter LLMs and scales to 111B-parameter merges without retraining.

Conclusion: SimMerge offers a practical, scalable solution for model merging, especially when evaluation resources are limited.

Abstract: Model merging enables multiple large language models (LLMs) to be combined into a single model while preserving performance. This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \simmerge{}, \emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly. Our results suggest that learning how to merge is a practical route to scalable model composition when checkpoint catalogs are large and evaluation budgets are tight.

*Weiguo Gao,Ming Li,Qianxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes TOCFlow, a method for sampling from terminally constrained distributions using pre-trained flow-based models, combining optimal control theory with geometric insights for efficient and accurate constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of sampling from distributions with terminal constraints using pre-trained flow-based generative models, ensuring both constraint satisfaction and generative quality.

Method: The method involves formulating the problem as an optimal control task, deriving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the value function, and introducing TOCFlow, a geometry-aware guidance method that operates in a terminal co-moving frame for computational efficiency.

Result: TOCFlow outperforms Euclidean guidance and projection baselines in satisfying equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints across high-dimensional tasks like Darcy flow, trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that TOCFlow effectively balances generative quality with constraint satisfaction, offering a computationally efficient and geometrically consistent solution for constrained sampling tasks.

Abstract: We address the problem of sampling from terminally constrained distributions with pre-trained flow-based generative models through an optimal control formulation. Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling. Across all settings, TOCFlow improves constraint satisfaction over Euclidean guidance and projection baselines while preserving the reference model's generative quality.

TL;DR: DeepONets are explored as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation, demonstrating accurate predictions beyond training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate computationally expensive cyclic adsorption processes like TVSA by using DeepONets as efficient surrogates.

Method: Applied DeepONets to approximate solution operators for PDEs in adsorption technologies, using mixed training datasets with heterogeneous initial conditions.

Result: DeepONets accurately predict solutions within and beyond training distributions, validating their feasibility for cyclic process optimization.

Conclusion: DeepONets show promise as efficient surrogates for accelerating cyclic adsorption simulations and optimization workflows.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks are emerging as fundamental tools among various neural network types to learn mappings between function spaces, and have recently gained attention due to their ability to approximate nonlinear operators. In particular, DeepONets offer a natural formulation for PDE solving, since the solution of a partial differential equation can be interpreted as an operator mapping an initial condition to its corresponding solution field. In this work, we applied DeepONets in the context of process modeling for adsorption technologies, to assess their feasibility as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation and optimization. The goal is to accelerate convergence of cyclic processes such as Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA), which require repeated solution of transient PDEs, which are computationally expensive. Since each step of a cyclic adsorption process starts from the final state of the preceding step, effective surrogate modeling requires generalization across a wide range of initial conditions. The governing equations exhibit steep traveling fronts, providing a demanding benchmark for operator learning. To evaluate functional generalization under these conditions, we construct a mixed training dataset composed of heterogeneous initial conditions and train DeepONets to approximate the corresponding solution operators. The trained models are then tested on initial conditions outside the parameter ranges used during training, as well as on completely unseen functional forms. The results demonstrate accurate predictions both within and beyond the training distribution, highlighting DeepONets as potential efficient surrogates for accelerating cyclic adsorption simulations and optimization workflows.

Motivation: Addressing unreliable probability estimates and overconfidence in deep neural networks using conformal prediction frameworks.

Method: Class Adaptive Conformal Training (CaCT), formulated as an augmented Lagrangian optimization problem, adaptively shapes prediction sets class-conditionally.

Result: CaCT outperforms prior methods, producing smaller and more informative prediction sets while maintaining coverage guarantees across benchmarks.

Conclusion: CaCT effectively improves uncertainty quantification in neural networks without requiring prior knowledge of data distributions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a variety of tasks, yet they often suffer from unreliable probability estimates. As a result, they can be overconfident in their predictions. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a principled framework for uncertainty quantification, yielding prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees. Existing conformal training methods optimize for overall set size, but shaping the prediction sets in a class-conditional manner is not straightforward and typically requires prior knowledge of the data distribution. In this work, we introduce Class Adaptive Conformal Training (CaCT), which formulates conformal training as an augmented Lagrangian optimization problem that adaptively learns to shape prediction sets class-conditionally without making any distributional assumptions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including standard and long-tailed image recognition as well as text classification, demonstrate that CaCT consistently outperforms prior conformal training methods, producing significantly smaller and more informative prediction sets while maintaining the desired coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Kernel-based methods are used in the context of Granger Causality to enable the identification of nonlinear causal relationships between time series variables.

Additionally, we introduce a Gaussian Process score-based model with Smooth Information Criterion penalisation on the marginal likelihood, and demonstrate improved performance over existing state of the art time-series nonlinear causal discovery methods. Furthermore, we propose a contemporaneous causal identification algorithm, fully based on GC, using the proposed score-based $GP_{SIC}$ method, and compare its performance to a state of the art contemporaneous time series causal discovery algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training methods for single-head looped Transformers fail due to complex loss landscapes, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: Leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the loss landscape geometry, treating parameter updates as physical flow.

Result: Successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer (model dimension 8) on the induction head task for 1000-token sequences.

Conclusion: The framework reveals internal mechanisms of looped Transformers and addresses optimization challenges.

Abstract: Recent research suggests that looped Transformers have superior reasoning capabilities compared to standard deep architectures. Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens. This success reveals the internal mechanism behind the superior reasoning capability.

TL;DR: Machine unlearning's effectiveness varies across samples, influenced by model-internal mechanisms. Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD) predicts sample difficulty pre-unlearning, revealing mechanistic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in machine unlearning success by understanding model-internal mechanisms that encode memorized information.

Method: Propose CUD, a pre-unlearning metric using circuit-level signals to score sample difficulty, analyzing mechanistic patterns.

Result: CUD reliably separates easy and hard samples, identifying shorter/shallower interactions for easy samples and longer/deeper pathways for hard ones.

Conclusion: CUD provides a principled, interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty, guiding future unlearning methods based on model mechanisms.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is becoming essential for building trustworthy and compliant language models. Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for optimizing battery charging protocols are limited by slow evaluations and constrained search spaces, hindering the discovery of high-performing solutions.

Method: Two gradient-free, LLM-driven methods are proposed: P2O (uses LLM to generate neural-network-based protocols) and P2P (directly writes explicit functions for current and parameters).

Result: P2O outperforms Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search. Both P2O and P2P improve battery health by 4.2% over existing baselines.

Conclusion: LLMs can expand protocol search spaces, incorporate language constraints, and enable efficient optimization in costly experimental settings.

Abstract: Efficiently optimizing battery charging protocols is challenging because each evaluation is slow, costly, and non-differentiable. Many existing approaches address this difficulty by heavily constraining the protocol search space, which limits the diversity of protocols that can be explored, preventing the discovery of higher-performing solutions. We introduce two gradient-free, LLM-driven closed-loop methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O), which uses an LLM to propose the code for small neural-network-based protocols, which are then trained by an inner loop, and Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P), which simply writes an explicit function for the current and its scalar parameters. Across our case studies, LLM-guided P2O outperforms neural networks designed by Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search. In a realistic fast charging scenario, both P2O and P2P yield around a 4.2 percent improvement in state of health (capacity retention based health metric under fast charging cycling) over a state-of-the-art multi-step constant current (CC) baseline, with P2P achieving this under matched evaluation budgets (same number of protocol evaluations). These results demonstrate that LLMs can expand the space of protocol functional forms, incorporate language-based constraints, and enable efficient optimization in high cost experimental settings.

Motivation: To understand the effectiveness and limitations of fine-tuning TFMs compared to zero-shot learning, and how dataset characteristics influence outcomes.

Method: Compared Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) on benchmarks like TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla, analyzing dataset factors.

Result: Zero-shot TFMs perform well; fine-tuning benefits vary by model and data. Meta-learning and PEFT offer moderate gains, while SFT often degrades accuracy or calibration.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning in TFMs has context-dependent benefits; zero-shot is often sufficient, and guidelines help decide when fine-tuning is useful.

Abstract: Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) have recently shown strong in-context learning capabilities on structured data, achieving zero-shot performance comparable to traditional machine learning methods. We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditions, whereas full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often reduces accuracy or calibration quality. This work presents the first comprehensive study of fine-tuning in TFMs across benchmarks including TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla. We compare Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised (SFT), and parameter-efficient (PEFT) approaches, analyzing how dataset factors such as imbalance, size, and dimensionality affect outcomes. Our findings cover performance, calibration, and fairness, offering practical guidelines on when fine-tuning is most beneficial and its limitations.

Method: The authors propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method that dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto orthogonal complements within the LoRA subspace, tailored for its bipartite structure.

Result: Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show Ortho-LoRA effectively reduces task interference, recovering 95% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational cost.

Conclusion: Ortho-LoRA provides a practical solution for mitigating negative transfer in MTL with LoRA, enhancing performance without significant overhead.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising direction for parameter-efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead.

*Lisa Schneckenreiter,Sohvi Luukkonen,Lukas Friedrich,Daniel Kuhn,Günter Klambauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConGLUDe introduces a contrastive geometric model unifying structure- and ligand-based drug design, improving tasks like virtual screening and target fishing without requiring pre-defined pockets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional drug design methods rely on disjoint data sources, limiting joint scalability. ConGLUDe aims to unify these approaches.

Method: ConGLUDe uses contrastive learning with geometric protein and fast ligand encoders to align ligands with protein representations and candidate binding sites.

Result: It achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening, outperforms in target fishing, and shows competitive pocket selection.

Conclusion: ConGLUDe demonstrates the benefits of unified training and advances foundation models for drug discovery.

Abstract: Structure-based and ligand-based computational drug design have traditionally relied on disjoint data sources and modeling assumptions, limiting their joint use at scale. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.

*Mayank Sharma,Roy Pea,Hari Subramonyam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses pedagogical limitations of LLMs in education by introducing ConvoLearn, a dataset for knowledge-building dialogues, showing improved tutor behavior after fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in education often reveal solutions instead of fostering dialogue; this work aims to improve their pedagogical effectiveness.

Method: Constructs a semi-synthetic dataset (ConvoLearn) of tutor-student dialogues and uses QLoRA to fine-tune Mistral 7B.

Result: Fine-tuned Mistral 7B outperforms its base version and Claude Sonnet in human evaluations by teachers.

Conclusion: ConvoLearn offers a framework for developing and evaluating AI tutors with constructivist approaches.

Abstract: In educational applications, LLMs exhibit several fundamental pedagogical limitations, such as their tendency to reveal solutions rather than support dialogic learning. We introduce ConvoLearn (https://huggingface.co/datasets/masharma/convolearn ), a dataset grounded in knowledge building theory that operationalizes six core pedagogical dimensions: cognitive engagement, formative assessment, accountability, cultural responsiveness, metacognition, and power dynamics. We construct a semi-synthetic dataset of 1250 tutor-student dialogues (20 turns each) in middle school Earth Science through controlled interactions between human teachers and a simulated student. Using QLoRA, we demonstrate that training on this dataset meaningfully shifts LLM behavior toward knowledge-building strategies. Human evaluation by 31 teachers shows our fine-tuned Mistral 7B (M = 4.10, SD = 1.03) significantly outperforms both its base version (M = 2.59, SD = 1.11) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (M = 2.87, SD = 1.29) overall. This work establishes a potential framework to guide future development and evaluation of constructivist AI tutors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ART, a benchmark for evaluating medical AI agents on action-based reasoning tasks using real EHR data, identifying key error categories and assessing LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical decision support by addressing inadequacies in existing benchmarks for evaluating medical AI agents on complex, action-based tasks involving EHRs.

Method: A four-stage pipeline (scenario identification, task generation, quality audit, evaluation) to create diverse, clinically validated tasks from real EHR data, assessing LLMs on retrieval, aggregation, and conditional logic.

Result: LLMs like GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed near-perfect retrieval but significant gaps in aggregation (28--64%) and threshold reasoning (32--38%).

Conclusion: ART advances reliable clinical AI agents by exposing failure modes in EHR reasoning, supporting workforce capacity in high-demand care settings.

Abstract: Reliable clinical decision support requires medical AI agents capable of safe, multi-step reasoning over structured electronic health records (EHRs). While large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, existing benchmarks inadequately assess performance on action-based tasks involving threshold evaluation, temporal aggregation, and conditional logic. We introduce ART, an Action-based Reasoning clinical Task benchmark for medical AI agents, which mines real-world EHR data to create challenging tasks targeting known reasoning weaknesses. Through analysis of existing benchmarks, we identify three dominant error categories: retrieval failures, aggregation errors, and conditional logic misjudgments. Our four-stage pipeline -- scenario identification, task generation, quality audit, and evaluation -- produces diverse, clinically validated tasks grounded in real patient data. Evaluating GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 600 tasks shows near-perfect retrieval after prompt refinement, but substantial gaps in aggregation (28--64%) and threshold reasoning (32--38%). By exposing failure modes in action-oriented EHR reasoning, ART advances toward more reliable clinical agents, an essential step for AI systems that reduce cognitive load and administrative burden, supporting workforce capacity in high-demand care settings

TL;DR: An empirical study evaluates LLM-based agents on 150 workplace tasks, identifying a hierarchy of key capabilities and revealing significant failure rates even in top models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the readiness of LLM-based agents for real-world deployment by evaluating their performance in a realistic e-commerce RL environment.

Method: Evaluated frontier AI models in a Surge e-commerce RL environment, focusing on 150 tasks and analyzing failures across a hierarchy of agentic capabilities.

Result: Best models fail ~40% of tasks, with failures clustering along the hierarchy (tool use, planning, adaptability, groundedness, common-sense reasoning).

Conclusion: While current models show coherent multi-step behavior, major gaps remain before achieving human-level task completion in real-world settings.

Abstract: The advancement of large language model (LLM) based agents has shifted AI evaluation from single-turn response assessment to multi-step task completion in interactive environments. We present an empirical study evaluating frontier AI models on 150 workplace tasks within a realistic e-commerce RL environment from Surge. Our analysis reveals an empirically-derived \emph{hierarchy of agentic capabilities} that models must master for real-world deployment: (1) tool use, (2) planning and goal formation, (3) adaptability, (4) groundedness, and (5) common-sense reasoning. Even the best-performing models fail approximately 40\% of the tasks, with failures clustering predictably along this hierarchy. Weaker models struggle with fundamental tool use and planning, whereas stronger models primarily fail on tasks requiring contextual inference beyond explicit instructions. We introduce a task-centric design methodology for RL environments that emphasizes diversity and domain expert contributions, provide detailed failure analysis, and discuss implications for agent development. Our findings suggest that while current frontier models can demonstrate coherent multi-step behavior, substantial capability gaps remain before achieving human-level task completion in realistic workplace settings.

TL;DR: HACHI is a human-in-the-loop framework using AI agents to speed up development of interpretable clinical prediction models (CPMs) by exploring concepts in clinical notes, outperforming existing methods and improving generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CPM development is slow and resource-intensive, hindering practical use, especially with unstructured clinical notes.

Method: HACHI alternates between AI agent exploration of clinical note concepts and expert feedback, using simple yes-no questions in linear models.

Result: HACHI outperforms existing approaches, identifies new clinically relevant concepts, and enhances model generalizability in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: HACHI demonstrates the importance of clinical AI team involvement in refining CPMs and addressing biases, making model development more efficient and transparent.

Abstract: Developing safe, effective, and practically useful clinical prediction models (CPMs) traditionally requires iterative collaboration between clinical experts, data scientists, and informaticists. This process refines the often small but critical details of the model building process, such as which features/patients to include and how clinical categories should be defined. However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage.

TL;DR: SCOPE introduces a framework separating reasoning from execution for multi-constraint planning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower cost and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches struggle with inconsistency, error accumulation, and inflexibility in multi-constraint planning.

Method: SCOPE disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution, producing reusable solver functions.

Result: SCOPE achieves 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over CoT, reducing cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

Conclusion: SCOPE offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for multi-constraint planning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-constraint planning involves identifying, evaluating, and refining candidate plans while satisfying multiple, potentially conflicting constraints. Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

TL;DR: DScheLLM uses fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) in a dual-system architecture to handle dynamic scheduling disruptions, outperforming conventional methods with fast and slow reasoning modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic disruptions in production scheduling require adaptable solutions beyond traditional event-specific models.

Method: DScheLLM employs fine-tuned Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B LLMs within a dual-system framework, generating training data from exact schedules for fast and slow reasoning.

Result: Evaluations show fast-thinking mode produces high-quality schedules, while slow-thinking mode generates solver-compatible inputs.

Conclusion: DScheLLM demonstrates LLMs' potential for adaptive scheduling in dynamic environments, marking an early application in this domain.

Abstract: Production scheduling is highly susceptible to dynamic disruptions, such as variations in processing times, machine availability, and unexpected task insertions. Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.

It highlights gaps in current AI solutions, outlines the model architecture, and identifies key research challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI solutions in aviation are siloed and fail to integrate diverse data types, limiting situational awareness and real-time decision support. AviationLMM aims to bridge this gap by unifying multimodal data.

Method: The paper proposes a model architecture that processes multimodal inputs (voice, radar, telemetry, etc.), performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and generates flexible outputs (summaries, alerts, diagnostics).

Result: The paper identifies key research opportunities, including data alignment, pretraining, robustness, and synthetic scenario generation, to advance AviationLMM.

Conclusion: AviationLMM aims to catalyze research toward an integrated, trustworthy AI ecosystem for civil aviation, addressing current limitations and future challenges.

Abstract: Civil aviation is a cornerstone of global transportation and commerce, and ensuring its safety, efficiency and customer satisfaction is paramount. Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.

TL;DR: The survey explores memory's role in enhancing reasoning and adaptability in LLMs and MLLMs, categorizing memory into implicit, explicit, and agentic paradigms, and discusses advances and challenges in multi-modal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory mechanisms are crucial for transforming LLMs and MLLMs into interactive, continually learning systems, driving the need for a structured understanding of memory paradigms.

Method: The survey synthesizes literature into a taxonomy of memory frameworks: implicit (internal knowledge), explicit (external storage), and agentic (autonomous agents).

Result: Memory enhances reasoning, scalability, and multi-modal coherence, though challenges like capacity and factual consistency remain.

Conclusion: Memory integration is pivotal for advancing LLMs and MLLMs, with ongoing research needed to address open challenges in memory systems.

Abstract: Memory plays a foundational role in augmenting the reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity of modern Large Language Models and Multi-Modal LLMs. As these models transition from static predictors to interactive systems capable of continual learning and personalized inference, the incorporation of memory mechanisms has emerged as a central theme in their architectural and functional evolution. This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability.

Motivation: The paper aims to move beyond population-level sentiment analysis by focusing on how individual users form privacy concerns based on personal histories and context.

Method: PRA integrates privacy and cognitive theories, uses contextual filters for bounded rationality, and employs an LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator.

Result: PRA outperforms baseline agents in predicting privacy concerns and captures transferable reasoning across domains like AI, e-commerce, and healthcare.

Conclusion: PRA effectively simulates individual privacy reasoning, demonstrating practical utility in diverse domains.

Abstract: This paper introduces PRA, an AI-agent design for simulating how individual users form privacy concerns in response to real-world news. Moving beyond population-level sentiment analysis, PRA integrates privacy and cognitive theories to simulate user-specific privacy reasoning grounded in personal comment histories and contextual cues. The agent reconstructs each user's "privacy mind", dynamically activates relevant privacy memory through a contextual filter that emulates bounded rationality, and generates synthetic comments reflecting how that user would likely respond to new privacy scenarios. A complementary LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator, calibrated against an established privacy concern taxonomy, quantifies the faithfulness of generated reasoning. Experiments on real-world Hacker News discussions show that \PRA outperforms baseline agents in privacy concern prediction and captures transferable reasoning patterns across domains including AI, e-commerce, and healthcare.

TL;DR: MAXS is a meta-adaptive reasoning framework for LLM Agents that addresses local myopia and trajectory instability by integrating lookahead strategies and trajectory convergence mechanisms, outperforming existing methods in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM Agent methods suffer from locally myopic generation and trajectory instability, making it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Method: MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to estimate tool usage advantages and combines step consistency variance and trend slopes for stable reasoning. It also uses a trajectory convergence mechanism to control computational costs.

Result: MAXS outperforms existing methods across three base models and five datasets, demonstrating improved performance and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning, with lookahead strategies and tool usage proving particularly effective.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents exhibit inherent reasoning abilities through the collaboration of multiple tools. However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage.

TL;DR: CoT-Flow redefines reasoning steps as continuous probabilistic flows to quantify step-wise information gain, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chain-of-thought paradigms lack granular quantification of step-wise information gain, leading to inefficiency and optimization challenges.

Method: CoT-Flow introduces flow-guided decoding and flow-based reinforcement learning to quantify and optimize reasoning steps.

Result: Experiments show CoT-Flow achieves better balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.

Conclusion: CoT-Flow successfully addresses granularity gaps in reasoning processes, enhancing both efficiency and outcomes.

Abstract: High-quality chain-of-thought has demonstrated strong potential for unlocking the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmented and reactive human-driven pandemic responses by enabling coordinated policymaking across interdependent regions.

Method: Assigns LLM agents to regions for reasoning over local data and inter-agent communication, using simulations to explore counterfactual interventions.

Result: Reduces cumulative infections by up to 63.7% and deaths by 40.1% at state level, with aggregated improvements of 39.0% and 27.0%.

Conclusion: LLM multi-agent systems enhance pandemic control through coordinated policymaking.

Abstract: Effective pandemic control requires timely and coordinated policymaking across administrative regions that are intrinsically interdependent. However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states. These results demonstrate that LLM multi-agent systems can enable more effective pandemic control with coordinated policymaking...

*Wencheng Ye,Liang Peng,Xiaoyang Yuan,Yi Bin,Pengpeng Zeng,Hengyu Jin,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes RISER, a dynamic, adaptive activation steering framework for LLMs, improving reasoning efficiency and accuracy without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for steering LLM reasoning rely on static, manual interventions, which are inefficient for dynamic reasoning tasks.

Method: RISER uses a library of reusable reasoning vectors and a Router trained via reinforcement learning to dynamically compose these vectors for each input.

Result: RISER improves zero-shot accuracy by 3.4-6.5% over base models and outperforms CoT-style reasoning with higher token efficiency and robust gains.

Conclusion: RISER demonstrates efficient, adaptive, and interpretable control over LLM reasoning, advancing the field of parameter-efficient steering.

Abstract: Recent work on domain-specific reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often relies on training-intensive approaches that require parameter updates. While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning.

*Jian Zhang,Yu He,Zhiyuan Wang,Zhangqi Wang,Kai He,Fangzhi Xu,Qika Lin,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces $A^3$-Bench, a benchmark evaluating scientific reasoning via memory-driven activation, focusing on anchors and attractors. It includes annotated problems and a dual-scale evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook memory-driven mechanisms in reasoning, so $A^3$-Bench aims to bridge this gap by evaluating activation of prior knowledge.

Method: Annotated 2,198 science problems using SAPM and introduced a dual-scale framework with AAUI metric to measure memory activation.

Result: Experiments validated $A^3$-Bench, showing how memory activation affects reasoning performance.

Conclusion: $A^3$-Bench provides insights into memory-driven reasoning, enhancing understanding of its impact on scientific inference.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning relies not only on logical inference but also on activating prior knowledge and experiential structures. Memory can efficiently reuse knowledge and enhance reasoning consistency and stability. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate final answers or step-by-step coherence, overlooking the \textit{memory-driven} mechanisms that underlie human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors, then integrating them into multi-step inference. To address this gap, we propose $A^3$-Bench~ https://a3-bench.github.io, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate $A^3$-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.

TL;DR: M$^3$Searcher is a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that decouples information acquisition from answer derivation, outperforming existing approaches in complex multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DeepResearch-style agents are limited to text modality, and extending them to multimodal settings introduces challenges like specialization-generalization trade-offs and data scarcity.

Method: M$^3$Searcher uses a modular approach, optimized with a retrieval-oriented multi-objective reward, and is trained using the MMSearchVQA dataset for retrieval-centric RL.

Result: M$^3$Searcher shows superior performance, strong transfer adaptability, and effective reasoning in multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses multimodal challenges and improves autonomous information-seeking capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in DeepResearch-style agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in autonomous information acquisition and synthesize from real-world web environments. However, existing approaches remain fundamentally limited to text modality. Extending autonomous information-seeking agents to multimodal settings introduces critical challenges: the specialization-generalization trade-off that emerges when training models for multimodal tool-use at scale, and the severe scarcity of training data capturing complex, multi-step multimodal search trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation. M$^3$Searcher is optimized with a retrieval-oriented multi-objective reward that jointly encourages factual accuracy, reasoning soundness, and retrieval fidelity. In addition, we develop MMSearchVQA, a multimodal multi-hop dataset to support retrieval centric RL training. Experimental results demonstrate that M$^3$Searcher outperforms existing approaches, exhibits strong transfer adaptability and effective reasoning in complex multimodal tasks.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced automated multi-step reasoning, but their ability to generate complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories introduces severe privacy risks, as sensitive information may be deeply embedded throughout the reasoning process. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.

*Leszek Sliwko,Jolanta Mizeria-Pietraszko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using NLP and LLMs to simplify cluster workload allocation by interpreting natural language hints for scheduling, showing high accuracy and superior performance in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the usability gap in cluster workload allocation by leveraging NLP for intent-driven scheduling.

Method: Integrates an LLM (via Kubernetes scheduler extender) to parse natural language hints for soft affinity preferences, using a prototype with a cluster state cache and AWS Bedrock analyzer.

Result: High LLM parsing accuracy (>95%) and superior scheduling quality in complex scenarios compared to standard Kubernetes.

Conclusion: Semantic soft affinity via LLMs simplifies workload orchestration, though asynchronous processing is recommended for production due to latency.

Abstract: Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.

*Ioannis Peridis,Dimitrios Troullinos,Georgios Chalkiadakis,Pantelis Giankoulidis,Ioannis Papamichail,Markos Papageorgiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores lane-free traffic environments using MCTS planning for autonomous driving, enhanced by a pre-trained NN for better efficiency and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane-free traffic increases road capacity but poses challenges for autonomous driving, requiring advanced planning methods.

Method: Uses Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a pre-trained neural network (NN) to guide decision-making, balancing computational constraints.

Result: Evaluated metrics show improved safety (lower collision rates) and efficacy (higher speeds), with NN-guided MCTS performing faster.

Conclusion: NN-guided MCTS is effective for lane-free autonomous driving, balancing performance and computational resources.

Abstract: Lane-free traffic environments allow vehicles to better harness the lateral capacity of the road without being restricted to lane-keeping, thereby increasing the traffic flow rates. As such, we have a distinct and more challenging setting for autonomous driving. In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed). Then, we examine: (a) the influence of isotropic state information for vehicles in a lane-free environment, resulting in nudging behaviour--vehicles' policy reacts due to the presence of faster tailing ones, (b) the acceleration of performance for the NN-guided variant of MCTS, and (c) the trade-off between computational resources and solution quality.

*Qinglong Shi,Donghai Wang,Hantao Zhou,Jiguo Li,Jun Xu,Jiuchong Gao,Jinghua Hao,Renqing He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a proactive task-oriented agent paradigm with long-term adaptability, introduces Intent-Conditioned Monitoring and Event-Triggered Follow-up, and validates its approach using synthetic data and a new benchmark, ChronosBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reactive LLM agents lack long-term intent tracking and dynamic adaptation. The paper aims to bridge static user needs and dynamic environments.

Method: Proactive agents use Intent-Conditioned Monitoring and Event-Triggered Follow-up. A data synthesis pipeline creates multi-turn dialog data, and ChronosBench is introduced for evaluation.

Result: A fine-tuned model achieves an 85.19% task completion rate, outperforming other models in complex tasks with shifting intents.

Conclusion: The proactive paradigm and synthetic data-driven strategy are effective for long-term task-oriented interactions.

Abstract: Current large language model agents predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm, responding only to immediate user queries within short-term sessions. This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test. And the result validated the effectiveness of our data-driven strategy.

*Siyuan Liu,Hongbang Yuan,Xinze Li,Ziyue Zhu,Yixin Cao,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2QBench, a suite for evaluating LLM agents' environment understanding, revealing task success doesn't always reflect true comprehension and highlighting bottlenecks like exploration and state representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent evaluations focus on task success metrics but lack assessment of grounded environment understanding, prompting the need for a new paradigm.

Method: The authors propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), an automated evaluation paradigm, and implement it in T2QBench with diverse environments and QA pairs.

Result: Experiments show task success isn't a reliable indicator of environment understanding, and current memory mechanisms fail to support grounded learning.

Conclusion: Proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation are key challenges, providing a foundation for improving autonomous agent generalizability.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex decision-making and tool-use tasks, yet their ability to generalize across varying environments remains a under-examined concern. Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents.

*Dongjie Cheng,Yongqi Li,Zhixin Ma,Hongru Cai,Yupeng Hu,Wenjie Wang,Liqiang Nie,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces unified generative multimodal reasoning (Omni-R1 and Omni-R1-Zero) to address limitations in generalizability across diverse multimodal tasks by generating intermediate images during reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning approaches lack generalizability due to task-specific patterns, prompting the need for a unified method that supports diverse reasoning skills like image region zooming or object marking.

Method: Omni-R1 uses a two-stage SFT+RL framework with perception alignment loss and reward for functional image generation. Omni-R1-Zero bootstraps visualizations from text-only data, avoiding multimodal annotations.

Result: Omni-R1 achieves unified reasoning across tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero often matches or outperforms Omni-R1, demonstrating effectiveness without multimodal annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed generative multimodal reasoning paradigms show promise for unifying diverse reasoning skills, with Omni-R1-Zero offering a scalable solution by leveraging text-only data.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the labor-intensive and time-consuming process of building large-scale optimization models by leveraging LLMs' capabilities.

Method: Proposes LEAN-LLM-OPT, which uses upstream LLM agents to dynamically construct workflows for optimization tasks and downstream agents to generate final outputs, offloading mechanical tasks to auxiliary tools.

Result: Achieves strong performance in simulations and practical use cases like Singapore Airlines' revenue management, introducing benchmarks Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM.

Conclusion: LEAN-LLM-OPT effectively automates optimization model formulation, demonstrating competitive performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Large-scale optimization is a key backbone of modern business decision-making. However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation. The code and data of this work is available at https://github.com/CoraLiang01/lean-llm-opt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world GUI agents must align with complex implicit intents, requiring resolution of omitted preferences and anticipation of latent routines.

Method: Developed Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent) with continuously updating memory and hierarchical organization of user preferences/routines.

Result: HIM-Agent improved execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3% on AndroidIntent benchmark.

Conclusion: HIM-Agent effectively personalizes GUI agent tasks by leveraging hierarchical memory and long-term user records.

Abstract: While GUI agents have shown strong performance under explicit and completion instructions, real-world deployment requires aligning with users' more complex implicit intents. In this work, we highlight Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent (PersonalAlign), a new agent task that requires agents to leverage long-term user records as persistent context to resolve omitted preferences in vague instructions and anticipate latent routines by user state for proactive assistance. To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%.

TL;DR: MATTRL is a framework enhancing multi-agent systems by integrating structured textual experience during inference, improving accuracy without tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent RL training is resource-intensive and unstable due to non-stationarity and sparse rewards, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: MATTRL forms specialist teams for discussions, retrieves test-time experiences, and uses consensus-based decision-making, alongside studying credit assignment for experience reinjection.

Result: MATTRL improves accuracy by 3.67% over multi-agent baselines and 8.67% over single-agent baselines in medicine, math, and education benchmarks.

Conclusion: MATTRL provides a stable, efficient solution for robust multi-agent reasoning under distribution shifts, validated by ablation studies on credit assignment.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI framework for proactive resilience in supply chains, detecting disruptions autonomously with high accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chains lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until disruptions cascade downstream.

Method: A minimally supervised agentic AI framework uses seven specialized agents (with LLMs and deterministic tools) to monitor, analyze, and respond to disruptions.

Result: The framework achieves high accuracy (F1 scores: 0.962-0.991), completes analyses in ~3.83 minutes at $0.0836 per disruption, and is validated in a real-world case study.

Conclusion: The work advances resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing deep-tier disruptions.

Abstract: Modern supply chains are increasingly exposed to disruptions from geopolitical events, demand shocks, trade restrictions, to natural disasters. While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time. A real-world case study of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict further demonstrates operational applicability. This work establishes a foundational step toward building resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing disruptions across deep-tier networks.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MACRO-LLM enhances LLM agents' coordination in spatially distributed settings by addressing spatiotemporal partial observability through three specialized modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed LLM agents face challenges due to limited local perception and temporal constraints, hindering efficient coordination.

Method: MACRO-LLM introduces three modules: CoProposer for temporal uncertainty, Negotiator for spatial constraints, and Introspector for adaptive learning.

Result: The framework improves coordination in cooperative adaptive cruise control and pandemic control tasks.

Conclusion: MACRO-LLM effectively mitigates spatiotemporal limitations, enabling robust multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents deployed in complex real-world scenarios typically operate as spatially distributed entities. However, this physical dispersion constrains agents to limited local perception and finite temporal horizons. We characterize this bottleneck as spatiotemporal partial observability. Given such fragmented awareness, distributed agents struggle to coordinate efficiently. To bridge this gap, we introduce MACRO-LLM, LLM-empowered multi-agent collaborative reasoning under spatiotemporal partial observability. The architecture addresses spatiotemporal constraints via three modules: (1) the CoProposer mitigates temporal uncertainty by verifying candidate actions via predictive rollouts; (2) the Negotiator overcomes spatial myopia by resolving conflicts through mean-field statistical aggregation; and (3) the Introspector ensures continuous adaptation by analyzing historical experience to refine strategies via semantic gradient descent. Extensive evaluations on two complex long-horizon tasks, cooperative adaptive cruise control and pandemic control, demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates spatiotemporal partial observability through spatial and temporal strategies, enabling robust coordination.

TL;DR: SC-MAS is a framework for cost-efficient, heterogeneous multi-agent systems, improving performance while reducing costs compared to homogeneous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems rely on homogeneous collaboration, limiting flexibility. Inspired by Social Capital Theory, SC-MAS aims to enable tailored interactions for different agent roles.

Method: SC-MAS models systems as directed graphs with explicit pairwise collaboration strategies, dynamically selecting agent roles, communication patterns, and LLM backbones for tasks.

Result: SC-MAS improves accuracy by 3.35% on MMLU with a 15.38% cost reduction and achieves 3.53% accuracy gain with 12.13% cost reduction on MBPP.

Conclusion: SC-MAS validates the effectiveness of heterogeneous collaboration in multi-agent systems, balancing performance and cost.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enhance complex problem solving through multi-agent collaboration, but often incur substantially higher costs than single-agent systems. Recent MAS routing methods aim to balance performance and overhead by dynamically selecting agent roles and language models. However, these approaches typically rely on a homogeneous collaboration mode, where all agents follow the same interaction pattern, limiting collaboration flexibility across different roles. Motivated by Social Capital Theory, which emphasizes that different roles benefit from distinct forms of collaboration, we propose SC-MAS, a framework for constructing heterogeneous and cost-efficient multi-agent systems. SC-MAS models MAS as directed graphs, where edges explicitly represent pairwise collaboration strategies, allowing different agent pairs to interact through tailored communication patterns. Given an input query, a unified controller progressively constructs an executable MAS by selecting task-relevant agent roles, assigning edge-level collaboration strategies, and allocating appropriate LLM backbones to individual agents. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-MAS. In particular, SC-MAS improves accuracy by 3.35% on MMLU while reducing inference cost by 15.38%, and achieves a 3.53% accuracy gain with a 12.13% cost reduction on MBPP. These results validate the feasibility of SC-MAS and highlight the effectiveness of heterogeneous collaboration in multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based digital populations lack accuracy and diversity compared to real human populations. Addressing this can reduce costs and human study concerns.

Method: Proposes CrowdLLM, combining pretrained LLMs and generative models for better diversity and fidelity.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments show CrowdLLM's potential for cost-effective, scalable, and representative digital populations.

Conclusion: CrowdLLM achieves promising performance across domains, matching human data accuracy and distributional fidelity.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked much interest in creating LLM-based digital populations that can be applied to many applications such as social simulation, crowdsourcing, marketing, and recommendation systems. A digital population can reduce the cost of recruiting human participants and alleviate many concerns related to human subject study. However, research has found that most of the existing works rely solely on LLMs and could not sufficiently capture the accuracy and diversity of a real human population. To address this limitation, we propose CrowdLLM that integrates pretrained LLMs and generative models to enhance the diversity and fidelity of the digital population. We conduct theoretical analysis of CrowdLLM regarding its great potential in creating cost-effective, sufficiently representative, scalable digital populations that can match the quality of a real crowd. Comprehensive experiments are also conducted across multiple domains (e.g., crowdsourcing, voting, user rating) and simulation studies which demonstrate that CrowdLLM achieves promising performance in both accuracy and distributional fidelity to human data.
