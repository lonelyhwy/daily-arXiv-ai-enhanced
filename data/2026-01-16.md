Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCF3D is a sensor fusion framework combining RGB and LiDAR data for improved 3D object detection in Autonomous Driving, outperforming LiDAR-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous Vehicles use RGB cameras and LiDAR sensors, but combining these data sources effectively for accurate 3D object detection is challenging.

Method: LCF3D integrates a 2D RGB detector and a 3D LiDAR detector using late fusion (filtering unmatched LiDAR detections) and cascade fusion (recovering missed objects).

Result: LCF3D improves domain generalization and outperforms LiDAR-based methods, especially for pedestrians, cyclists (KITTI), motorcycles, and bicycles (nuScenes).

Conclusion: LCF3D demonstrates significant advancements in multimodal fusion for 3D object detection in Autonomous Driving.

Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D objects like pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles is essential in Autonomous Driving. To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains. LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in the KITTI dataset, as well as motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes.

### [3] [NanoSD: Edge Efficient Foundation Model for Real Time Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09823)
*Subhajit Sanyal,Srinivas Soumitri Miriyala,Akshay Janardan Bankar,Sravanth Kodavanti,Harshit,Abhishek Ameta,Shreyas Pandith,Amit Satish Unde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NanoSD is a lightweight, Pareto-optimal diffusion model family distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5, optimized for real-time image restoration on edge devices by balancing accuracy, latency, and size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight diffusion models disrupt latent manifolds and lack generalization, limiting their practicality for edge devices. NanoSD aims to preserve generative priors while enabling efficient deployment.

Method: The approach involves network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and architectural scaling applied to the U-Net and VAE encoder-decoder, ensuring a balanced design.

Result: NanoSD achieves real-time inference (down to 20ms on mobile NPUs) with 130M-315M parameters, outperforming prior models in perceptual quality and deployability for tasks like super-resolution and deblurring.

Conclusion: NanoSD introduces a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 offer strong generative priors that are highly valuable for image restoration, yet their full pipelines remain too computationally heavy for deployment on edge devices. Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability. NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices.

### [4] [ViSIL: Unified Evaluation of Information Loss in Multimodal Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09851)
*Po-han Li,Shenghui Chen,Ufuk Topcu,Sandeep Chinchali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViSIL, a metric quantifying information loss in multimodal video summaries, showing significant correlation with human and VLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics fail to assess information coverage across modalities (text and keyframes), prompting the need for a unified evaluation framework.

Method: ViSIL uses an information-theoretic approach via VLM inference to measure uncaptured video information in summaries.

Result: ViSIL correlates with human and VLM VQA performance and optimizes summary selection for better accuracy without added processing.

Conclusion: ViSIL provides a robust, unified metric for multimodal summaries, improving VQA accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal video captioning condenses dense footage into a structured format of keyframes and natural language. By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.

### [5] [Breaking the Limits of Open-Weight CLIP: An Optimization Framework for Self-supervised Fine-tuning of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09859)
*Anant Mehta,Xiyuan Wei,Xingyu Chen,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TuneCLIP is a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that improves open-weight CLIP models' performance across tasks without costly retraining, using warm-up and contrastive loss stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance CLIP model performance across downstream tasks without expensive retraining, addressing degradation issues in standard fine-tuning.

Method: Introduces TuneCLIP with a warm-up stage to reduce cold-start bias and a fine-tuning stage with a new contrastive loss to avoid penalizing false negatives.

Result: TuneCLIP consistently improves performance, achieving gains like +2.5% on ImageNet and +1.2% on DataComp, setting a strong post-pretraining baseline.

Conclusion: TuneCLIP effectively boosts CLIP model performance across architectures and scales, offering a cost-efficient adaptation method.

Abstract: CLIP has become a cornerstone of multimodal representation learning, yet improving its performance typically requires a prohibitively costly process of training from scratch on billions of samples. We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VibrantSR is a generative super-resolution framework that estimates high-resolution canopy height models from Sentinel-2 imagery, outperforming satellite benchmarks and enabling scalable forest monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide consistent, scalable canopy height monitoring using globally available Sentinel-2 data, avoiding reliance on infrequent aerial imagery.

Method: Uses generative super-resolution on Sentinel-2 seasonal composites to estimate 0.5m canopy height models.

Result: Achieves MAE of 4.39m, outperforming Meta, LANDFIRE, and ETH benchmarks, and enables continental-scale monitoring.

Conclusion: VibrantSR offers a practical solution for forest monitoring and carbon accounting without costly aerial data.

Abstract: We present VibrantSR (Vibrant Super-Resolution), a generative super-resolution framework for estimating 0.5 meter canopy height models (CHMs) from 10 meter Sentinel-2 imagery. Unlike approaches based on aerial imagery that are constrained by infrequent and irregular acquisition schedules, VibrantSR leverages globally available Sentinel-2 seasonal composites, enabling consistent monitoring at a seasonal-to-annual cadence. Evaluated across 22 EPA Level 3 eco-regions in the western United States using spatially disjoint validation splits, VibrantSR achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 4.39 meters for canopy heights >= 2 m, outperforming Meta (4.83 m), LANDFIRE (5.96 m), and ETH (7.05 m) satellite-based benchmarks. While aerial-based VibrantVS (2.71 m MAE) retains an accuracy advantage, VibrantSR enables operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales without reliance on costly and temporally infrequent aerial acquisitions.

*Yang Xing,Jiong Wu,Savas Ozdemir,Ying Zhang,Yang Yang,Wei Shao,Kuang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVL-SAM2 is a unified 3D medical vision-language model that integrates report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance through joint language-understanding and segmentation training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of unifying fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs within a single framework.

Method: Proposes MedVL-SAM2, integrating image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception via a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module, trained in a multi-stage pipeline with 3D CT image-text pairs and segmentation objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in report generation, VQA, and 3D segmentation tasks, with reliable 3D visual grounding and robust cross-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be unified in a single 3D medical VLM.

Abstract: Recent progress in medical vision-language models (VLMs) has achieved strong performance on image-level text-centric tasks such as report generation and visual question answering (VQA). However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Extensive analyses further show that the model provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning, demonstrating that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM.

*Zhihua Zhao,Guoqiang Li,Chen Min,Kangping Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OT-Drive is a novel Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework for robust traversable area segmentation in autonomous driving, outperforming prior methods in OOD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven approaches for traversable area segmentation degrade in OOD scenarios, impairing autonomous driving tasks. OT-Drive addresses this by enhancing generalization to unseen conditions.

Method: OT-Drive uses Optimal Transport for RGB and surface normal fusion, featuring a Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scenes into semantic anchors and an OT Fusion module to align features.

Result: Achieves 95.16% mIoU on OOD scenarios (6.35% improvement) and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset tasks (13.99% improvement), demonstrating strong OOD generalization with limited training data.

Conclusion: OT-Drive significantly improves segmentation robustness in OOD scenarios, making it practical and efficient for real-world autonomous driving deployment.

Abstract: Reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments is critical for planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models (VLMs) lack spatial awareness due to flattened image encoders, prompting exploration of alternative objectives and 2D positional encodings for improved spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs, built with CLIP-style encoders, discard 2D structure, limiting spatial reasoning crucial for robotics and embodied AI.

Method: Investigates alternative image encoders and 2D positional encodings to address spatial awareness gaps.

Result: Architectural changes improve spatial reasoning performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Enhancing spatial awareness in VLMs is critical for applications requiring spatial grounding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, but their ability to capture spatial relationships remains a blindspot. Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings. Our experiments show that these architectural choices can lead to improved spatial reasoning on several benchmarks.

*Yulin He,Wei Chen,Zhikang Jian,Tianhang Guo,Wenjuan Zhou,Minglong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DR$^2$Seg is a self-rewarding framework that improves reasoning segmentation efficiency and accuracy by decomposing the task into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation, using self-contained descriptions and self-rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reasoning segmentation suffer from overthinking and verbose reasoning chains, interfering with object localization in MLLMs.

Method: DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout: generating a self-contained description of the target object and verifying its self-containment, reinforced by self-rewards.

Result: The framework consistently enhances reasoning efficiency and segmentation performance across MLLMs and segmentation models.

Conclusion: DR$^2$Seg effectively addresses overthinking in reasoning segmentation, improving both efficiency and accuracy without extra supervision.

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation is an emerging vision-language task that requires reasoning over intricate text queries to precisely segment objects. However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking. Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models demonstrate that DR$^2$Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel DW-DGAT method integrates multi-metric data fusion, dual graph attention, and class imbalance mitigation for early diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, showing superior performance in validation studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's (AD) diseases is crucial for slowing progression, but challenges like high-dimensional data, heterogeneity, and class imbalance hinder accuracy.

Method: The study introduces DW-DGAT, merging three data structures, using dual graph attention for feature extraction, and employing class weight generation with loss functions to address imbalance.

Result: Experiments on PPMI and ADNI datasets confirm DW-DGAT's state-of-the-art performance in diagnosing PD and AD.

Conclusion: DW-DGAT effectively tackles key challenges in ND diagnosis, offering a promising tool for early and accurate detection.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the two most prevalent and incurable neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) worldwide, for which early diagnosis is critical to delay their progression. However, the high dimensionality of multi-metric data with diverse structural forms, the heterogeneity of neuroimaging and phenotypic data, and class imbalance collectively pose significant challenges to early ND diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamically weighted dual graph attention network (DW-DGAT) that integrates: (1) a general-purpose data fusion strategy to merge three structural forms of multi-metric data; (2) a dual graph attention architecture based on brain regions and inter-sample relationships to extract both micro- and macro-level features; and (3) a class weight generation mechanism combined with two stable and effective loss functions to mitigate class imbalance. Rigorous experiments, based on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzhermer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

*Zefan Zhang,Kehua Zhu,Shijie Jiang,Hongyuan Lu,Shengkai Sun,Tian Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel benchmark, VERHallu, is introduced to evaluate event relation hallucination in VideoLLMs, focusing on causal, temporal, and subevent relations. Current models struggle with dense-event reasoning, relying on prior knowledge. A Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy is proposed to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on VideoLLMs has overlooked event relation hallucination, focusing instead on events, objects, and scenes. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating causal, temporal, and subevent relations.

Method: The paper introduces the VERHallu benchmark, featuring tasks like relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering. It includes counterintuitive video scenarios and human-annotated candidates. The Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy is proposed to enhance multi-event understanding.

Result: Current VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning and rely on prior knowledge. The KFP strategy effectively mitigates event relation hallucination without impacting inference speed.

Conclusion: The VERHallu benchmark highlights gaps in VideoLLMs' event relation understanding. The proposed KFP strategy improves performance by reallocating frame-level attention, offering a solution to event relation hallucination.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) exhibit various types of hallucinations. Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding. Experiments show it effectively mitigates the event relation hallucination without affecting inference speed.

TL;DR: DiCo tackles the TIReID challenge by introducing hierarchical, disentangled cross-modal alignment using slot-based representations for fine-grained retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the modality gap and fine-grained correspondence challenges in text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID).

Method: Proposes DiCo, a framework using shared slot-based representations decomposed into concept blocks for disentangling attributes.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets and improves interpretability.

Conclusion: DiCo effectively bridges visual-textual gaps and enhances fine-grained retrieval through disentangled part-level alignment.

Abstract: Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) aims to retrieve person images from a large gallery given free-form textual descriptions. TIReID is challenging due to the substantial modality gap between visual appearances and textual expressions, as well as the need to model fine-grained correspondences that distinguish individuals with similar attributes such as clothing color, texture, or outfit style. To address these issues, we propose DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation), a novel framework that achieves hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment. DiCo introduces a shared slot-based representation, where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks. This design enables the disentanglement of complementary attributes (\textit{e.g.}, color, texture, shape) while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence between image and text. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, while also enhancing interpretability through explicit slot- and block-level representations for more fine-grained retrieval results.

TL;DR: A synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow is introduced to address challenges in underwater imaging, leveraging event cameras' advantages and providing ground-truth data for future algorithm development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater imaging faces issues like light attenuation and scattering, making ground-truth motion hard to capture. Event cameras' high dynamic range and resolution offer potential solutions but lack paired datasets.

Method: A synthetic dataset is created using ray-traced RGBD sequences and a video-to-event pipeline, generating realistic event data with ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion.

Result: The dataset benchmarks state-of-the-art optical flow methods, revealing how underwater conditions impact event formation and motion estimation.

Conclusion: This dataset sets a new baseline for underwater event-based perception algorithms, with publicly available resources for further research.

Abstract: Underwater imaging is fundamentally challenging due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation, strong scattering from suspended particles, turbidity-induced blur, and non-uniform illumination. These effects impair standard cameras and make ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. On the other hand, event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Moreover, we benchmark state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy. Our dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms. The source code and dataset for this project are publicly available at https://robotic-vision-lab.github.io/ueof.

Motivation: Current video models excel in visual tasks but lack clear application in text-to-image generation due to undefined reasoning steps. CoF-T2I aims to fill this gap.

Method: CoF-T2I uses progressive visual refinement with intermediate frames as reasoning steps. It employs CoF-Evol-Instruct dataset and independent frame encoding to enhance quality.

Result: CoF-T2I outperforms the base video model, scoring 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench.

Conclusion: Video models hold significant potential for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation, as demonstrated by CoF-T2I.

Abstract: Recent video generation models have revealed the emergence of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning, enabling frame-by-frame visual inference. With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.

### [16] [ReaMIL: Reasoning- and Evidence-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Whole-Slide Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10073)
*Hyun Do Jung,Jungwon Choi,Hwiyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReaMIL enhances multiple instance learning for histopathology by adding a selection head with a budgeted-sufficiency objective, achieving high accuracy with minimal tile evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve evidence efficiency and transparency in whole-slide histopathology analysis without sacrificing performance.

Method: Introduces ReaMIL, which adds a selection head to MIL, trained with a budgeted-sufficiency objective to enforce true-class probability using minimal tiles under a sparsity budget.

Result: Matches or exceeds baseline AUC across datasets (TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-BRCA, PANDA), with minimal sufficient tiles (~8.2 for NSCLC) and high AUKC (~0.864).

Conclusion: ReaMIL provides efficient, transparent, and accurate evidence selection for histopathology, requiring no extra supervision and integrating smoothly with MIL training.

Abstract: We introduce ReaMIL (Reasoning- and Evidence-Aware MIL), a multiple instance learning approach for whole-slide histopathology that adds a light selection head to a strong MIL backbone. The head produces soft per-tile gates and is trained with a budgeted-sufficiency objective: a hinge loss that enforces the true-class probability to be $\geq τ$ using only the kept evidence, under a sparsity budget on the number of selected tiles. The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance. Across TCGA-NSCLC (LUAD vs. LUSC), TCGA-BRCA (IDC vs. Others), and PANDA, ReaMIL matches or slightly improves baseline AUC and provides quantitative evidence-efficiency diagnostics. On NSCLC, it attains AUC 0.983 with a mean minimal sufficient K (MSK) $\approx 8.2$ tiles at $τ= 0.90$ and AUKC $\approx 0.864$, showing that class confidence rises sharply and stabilizes once a small set of tiles is kept. The method requires no extra supervision, integrates seamlessly with standard MIL training, and naturally yields slide-level overlays. We report accuracy alongside MSK, AUKC, and contiguity for rigorous evaluation of model behavior on WSIs.

### [17] [Thinking Like Van Gogh: Structure-Aware Style Transfer via Flow-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10075)
*Zhendong Wang,Lebin Zhou,Jingchuan Xiao,Rongduo Han,Nam Ling,Cihan Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting to authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization by prioritizing geometric abstraction over surface-level texture projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods often invert the Post-Impressionist principle of exaggerating structural form. This paper aims to align stylization with van Gogh's philosophy by emphasizing geometric abstraction as the primary expressive tool.

Method: The proposed method uses flow-guided geometric advection in a mesh-free setting, extracting directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagating them into 3D space to align Gaussian primitives with brushstrokes. It also decouples luminance-structure optimization and employs a VLM-as-a-Judge framework for evaluation.

Result: The approach enables expressive structural deformation driven by artistic motion, avoiding reliance on explicit mesh priors and mitigating artifacts during aggressive abstraction.

Conclusion: The framework successfully operationalizes Post-Impressionist principles in 3D stylization, offering a mesh-free solution with improved artistic authenticity and subjective evaluation.

Abstract: In 1888, Vincent van Gogh wrote, "I am seeking exaggeration in the essential." This principle, amplifying structural form while suppressing photographic detail, lies at the core of Post-Impressionist art. However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.
  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.

*Mingzhuo Li,Guang Li,Linfeng Ye,Jiafeng Mao,Takahiro Ogawa,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Difficulty-Guided Sampling (DGS) and Difficulty-Aware Guidance (DAG) to bridge the gap between dataset distillation and downstream tasks, improving performance for image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks require extensive resources for training. Dataset distillation aims to create compact datasets that retain performance, but existing methods overlook task-specific information, creating a gap between distillation and downstream tasks.

Method: The authors introduce DGS, a post-stage sampling module guided by task difficulty, and DAG to explore difficulty's role in generation. These methods sample datasets from pools created by existing techniques.

Result: Experiments show DGS and DAG effectively improve performance in various settings, demonstrating the broader potential of difficulty-guided approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully bridge the target gap in dataset distillation, enhancing downstream task performance and highlighting the utility of difficulty-aware strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose difficulty-guided sampling (DGS) to bridge the target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task, therefore improving the performance of dataset distillation. Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods. We also propose difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore the effect of difficulty in the generation process. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It also highlights the broader potential of difficulty for diverse downstream tasks.

*Han Wang,Yi Yang,Jingyuan Hu,Minfeng Zhu,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-Zero is a self-improving framework for VLMs using unlabeled images, eliminating the need for costly human annotations. It employs a Questioner-Solver loop and GRPO for mutual enhancement, achieving notable performance gains without human labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and effort of acquiring large-scale human-annotated datasets for VLMs motivated the development of V-Zero, aiming to enable self-improvement using only unlabeled images.

Method: V-Zero uses a Questioner-Solver co-evolutionary loop. The Questioner generates challenging questions via dual-track reasoning rewards, while the Solver optimizes using pseudo-labels from majority voting. Both are trained iteratively with GRPO.

Result: V-Zero improves Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by +1.7 in visual math reasoning and +2.6 in general vision-centric tasks, without human annotations.

Conclusion: V-Zero demonstrates the feasibility of self-improving VLMs without human labels, offering a scalable solution for multimodal learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

*Wenwen Liao,Hang Ruan,Jianbo Yu,Yuansong Wang,Qingchao Jiang,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoSculpt introduces an information-theoretic framework for Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), using dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objectives to disentangle category-defining signals from noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods lack mechanisms to explicitly separate category-defining signals from instance-specific noise, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: InfoSculpt minimizes dual CMI objectives: Category-Level CMI for labeled data and Instance-Level CMI for all data, to learn compact and invariant features.

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks validate InfoSculpt's effectiveness in creating a robust and disentangled representation space.

Conclusion: InfoSculpt's information-theoretic approach successfully addresses GCD challenges, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify instances from both known and novel categories within a large-scale unlabeled dataset, a critical yet challenging task for real-world, open-world applications. However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that InfoSculpt validating the effectiveness of our information-theoretic approach.

TL;DR: FlowAct-R1 is a real-time interactive humanoid video generation framework that balances high-fidelity synthesis and low-latency responsiveness using MMDiT architecture, chunkwise diffusion forcing, and efficient optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video synthesis methods struggle with balancing high-fidelity output and real-time interaction. FlowAct-R1 addresses this gap for interactive humanoid agents.

Method: Uses MMDiT architecture with chunkwise diffusion forcing and self-forcing to ensure temporal consistency. Includes distillation and system optimizations for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 25fps at 480p with 1.5s TTFF, enabling fine-grained full-body control and natural transitions between behavioral states.

Conclusion: FlowAct-R1 excels in behavioral vividness, perceptual realism, and generalization across character styles, making it ideal for interactive applications.

Abstract: Interactive humanoid video generation aims to synthesize lifelike visual agents that can engage with humans through continuous and responsive video. Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.

TL;DR: MathDoc is a benchmark for extracting structured questions from noisy high school math exams, evaluating SOTA models' performance and refusal capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of extracting structured questions from visually noisy math exams, which existing benchmarks overlook.

Method: Introducing MathDoc with 3,609 curated questions, including unrecognizable samples, and proposing a multi-dimensional evaluation framework.

Result: SOTA models perform well in extraction but fail to refuse illegible inputs, revealing a reliability gap.

Conclusion: MathDoc highlights the need for improved model reliability in degraded document conditions.

Abstract: The automated extraction of structured questions from paper-based mathematics exams is fundamental to intelligent education, yet remains challenging in real-world settings due to severe visual noise. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs. These results highlight a critical gap in current MLLMs and establish MathDoc as a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions.

### [23] [Enhancing Visual In-Context Learning by Multi-Faceted Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10107)
*Wenwen Liao,Jianbo Yu,Yuansong Wang,Qingchao Jiang,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) that enhances contextual fusion by generating multiple representation branches from top-quality prompts, improving robustness and accuracy across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 'retrieve-then-prompt' methods discard valuable contextual information by focusing on single-prompt fusion, limiting reasoning capabilities. A more collaborative fusion approach is needed.

Method: The proposed framework generates three contextual representation branches from different combinations of top-quality prompts, integrated into a MULTI-VQGAN architecture for joint interpretation.

Result: Extensive experiments show strong cross-task generalization, effective fusion, and improved robustness and accuracy in tasks like segmentation, detection, and colorization.

Conclusion: The framework unlocks the potential of diverse contexts through multi-combination collaborative fusion, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant "retrieve-then-prompt" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.

*Wenwen Liao,Jianbo Yu,Yuansong Wang,Shifu Yan,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) framework that addresses limitations of existing methods by aggregating multiple prompts and leveraging layout priors, achieving better performance and cross-task generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VICL methods discard useful prompts and ignore structured information from prompt arrangements, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed framework includes an adaptive Fusion Module for aggregating prompts, lightweight MLPs for layout priors, and a bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism.

Result: The method shows superior performance in tasks like foreground segmentation, object detection, and image colorization.

Conclusion: The VICL framework improves inpainting models by better utilizing prompts and layout information, enabling strong cross-task generalization.

Abstract: Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) enables inpainting models to quickly adapt to new visual tasks from only a few prompts. However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.
  We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model. Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of our method.

*Sicheng Yang,Zhaohu Xing,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQ-Seg introduces vector quantization and a quantized perturbation module for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, avoiding dropout rate tuning and improving regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of dropout-based perturbation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, such as sensitive hyperparameter tuning and suboptimal regularization.

Method: Uses vector quantization for feature discretization, a Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM), a dual-branch architecture for shared feature space, and a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) for semantic guidance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the Lung Cancer dataset and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: VQ-Seg provides effective and controllable regularization without dropout, leveraging quantization and FM guidance for improved segmentation.

Abstract: Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: LaViT addresses the Perception Gap in multimodal reasoning by aligning latent visual thoughts between teacher and student models, enhancing visual grounding without relying on language priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a Perception Gap where student models mimic teacher textual outputs but attend to different visual regions, relying on language priors rather than grounded perception. This undermines true multimodal understanding.

Method: LaViT aligns latent visual thoughts instead of static embeddings. It forces students to autoregressively reconstruct teacher visual semantics and attention paths before text generation, using a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to avoid shortcuts.

Result: LaViT improves visual grounding significantly, with up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks. A compact 3B model outperforms larger open-source and proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: LaViT successfully bridges the Perception Gap by enforcing visual semantic alignment, achieving superior performance in multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Current multimodal latent reasoning often relies on external supervision (e.g., auxiliary images), ignoring intrinsic visual attention dynamics. In this work, we identify a critical Perception Gap in distillation: student models frequently mimic a teacher's textual output while attending to fundamentally divergent visual regions, effectively relying on language priors rather than grounded perception. To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks and enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), a task that enhances video anomaly analysis by requiring structured, multi-stage reasoning. It also presents a new dataset and an MLLM-based model, Vad-R1-Plus, which outperforms existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM-based methods in Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding lack explicit reasoning, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation, prompting the need for a more structured task.

Method: The paper defines the VAR task, introduces a dataset with 8,641 videos annotated using a PerCoAct-CoT framework, and proposes an Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization for weak supervision. An MLLM-based model, Vad-R1-Plus, is developed.

Result: The proposed benchmark and model significantly improve MLLM reasoning capabilities on VAR tasks, outperforming open-source and proprietary baselines.

Conclusion: The VAR task, dataset, and Vad-R1-Plus model advance video anomaly analysis by enabling structured, multi-stage reasoning and risk-aware decision making.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation suffer from low accuracy and speed due to viewpoint constraints, occlusions, and redundant data.

Method: The proposed RAG-3DSG uses re-shot guided uncertainty estimation to reduce noise and a retrieval-augmented generation approach for reliable object recognition. It also introduces a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy for faster cross-image object aggregation.

Result: Experiments on the Replica dataset show RAG-3DSG improves node captioning accuracy and reduces mapping time by two-thirds compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: RAG-3DSG effectively addresses the challenges of open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graph (3DSG) generation can enhance various downstream tasks in robotics, such as manipulation and navigation, by leveraging structured semantic representations. A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges. However, existing works for open-vocabulary 3DSG generation suffer from both low object-level recognition accuracy and speed, mainly due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density. To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity. Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.

TL;DR: OPIR proposes a two-stage framework for efficient all-in-one image restoration using task-aware inverse degradation operators, ensuring reliability with uncertainty maps and achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods complicate systems with added modules, hindering real-time use. OPIR aims for efficient and reliable restoration via physical degradation modeling.

Method: Predicts task-aware inverse operators in two stages: initial restoration with uncertainty maps, followed by refinement guided by uncertainty. Uses accelerated convolution for efficiency.

Result: OPIR demonstrates superior all-in-one restoration and remains competitive on task-specific restoration.

Conclusion: The tightly integrated OPIR framework efficiently handles multiple restoration tasks while maintaining reliability and performance.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to adaptively handle multiple restoration tasks with a single trained model. Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed OPIR, is extensively validated through experiments, demonstrating superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration.

*Kim Youwang,Lee Hyoseok,Subin Park,Gerard Pons-Moll,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELITE introduces an efficient method for Gaussian head avatar synthesis from monocular videos using learned initialization and test-time generative adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods either struggle with in-the-wild generalization (3D data prior) or are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination (2D generative prior). ELITE combines these approaches for better results.

Method: ELITE uses a Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) for fast initialization and a test-time generative adaptation stage with real and synthetic images. It also employs a single-step diffusion enhancer for detail restoration.

Result: ELITE outperforms prior works in visual quality for challenging expressions and is 60x faster than 2D generative prior methods.

Conclusion: ELITE efficiently synthesizes high-fidelity avatars with strong generalization, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce ELITE, an Efficient Gaussian head avatar synthesis from a monocular video via Learned Initialization and TEst-time generative adaptation. Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.

TL;DR: DepthDirector is a video re-rendering framework that leverages depth video and explicit 3D representation to enable precise camera control while preserving video content consistency, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for camera control in video generation often fail to fully utilize 3D priors, leading to inconsistencies and degraded quality. DepthDirector aims to solve this by integrating depth-based guidance into video diffusion models.

Method: DepthDirector uses a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism and a LoRA-based adapter to inject depth-guided camera control into pretrained video diffusion models, ensuring precise camera movements and content consistency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate DepthDirector's superiority in camera controllability and visual quality over existing approaches, validated using a custom Unreal Engine 5 dataset.

Conclusion: DepthDirector effectively addresses the camera control challenge in video generation, leveraging 3D priors and depth guidance to achieve high-quality, consistent results, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

*Megha Mariam K M,C. V. Jawahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to automatically highlight relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative, improving synchronization between spoken content and slide elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The disconnect between spoken content and slide visuals in presentations makes it hard for listeners to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced settings.

Method: Analyzes spoken content and matches it with textual/graphical elements in slides to identify and highlight relevant regions.

Result: Ensures better synchronization between audio and visual elements, reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

Conclusion: This approach addresses the challenge of aligning spoken and visual content in presentations, enhancing understanding and engagement.

Abstract: Imagine sitting in a presentation, trying to follow the speaker while simultaneously scanning the slides for relevant information. While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases. Analyzing multimedia documents is emerging as a key requirement for seamless understanding of content-rich videos, such as educational videos and conference talks, by reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining lags behind due to limited high-quality Chinese image-text data. DanQing aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Curated from Common Crawl using a rigorous selection process, DanQing contains 100 million image-text pairs sourced from 2024-2025 web data.

Result: DanQing consistently outperforms existing datasets in Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations.

Conclusion: DanQing enhances Chinese vision-language pre-training and will be open-sourced under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.

*Peng-Fei Zhang,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary: Proposed Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA) is a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models, refining adversarial perturbations at sample and optimization levels to improve efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of sample-specific adversarial attacks in VLP models, which are computationally expensive and impractical for large datasets or scenarios.

Method: HRA refines UAPs hierarchically: disentangles image perturbations for independent handling, uses ScMix augmentation, employs temporal hierarchy for optimization, and identifies globally influential words for text perturbations.

Result: Demonstrated superiority through extensive experiments across various tasks, models, and datasets.

Conclusion: HRA offers an efficient and effective universal attack framework for VLP models, reducing reliance on spurious features and computational overhead.

Abstract: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for streaming audio-video understanding suffer from disjointed capabilities, such as incomplete modality support or lack of autonomous proactive monitoring.

Method: ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligns dense audio with discrete video frames, and uses a lightweight speak head for decoupling response initiation from generation. It is trained with a curated dataset and a two-stage curriculum.

Result: ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks and remains competitive in reactive settings across 12 benchmarks.

Conclusion: ROMA demonstrates robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding, validated by its performance in both proactive and reactive tasks.

Abstract: Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.

*Yiming Zhang,Weibo Qin,Yuntian Liu,Feng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) for stealthy adversarial attacks on SAR-ATR systems, optimizing spatial deformation to degrade performance effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR imagery's sparsity and DNN-based SAR-ATR systems' vulnerability to adversarial attacks and over-reliance on backgrounds motivate the need for stealthier attack methods.

Method: Develops SRAW, generating adversarial examples via optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions.

Result: SRAW significantly degrades SAR-ATR model performance and outperforms existing methods in imperceptibility and transferability.

Conclusion: SRAW offers an effective, stealthy adversarial attack method for SAR-ATR, enhancing robustness assessment.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, enhancing text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging LLMs' reasoning capabilities for improved visual synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models use LLMs only as text encoders, missing their reasoning potential. T2G aims to bridge this gap for richer visual generation.

Method: The approach involves fine-tuning LLMs to rewrite prompts, co-optimizing them with diffusion models using Dual-GRPO, and reinforcing both with image-grounded rewards.

Result: The model achieves significant gains in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism, scoring 0.79 on WISE, nearly matching GPT-4.

Conclusion: T2G represents progress toward unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration abilities.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes CNNs for imaging inverse problems using MMSE estimator, introducing LE-MMSE to interpret CNN behaviors, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand CNNs' success in imaging inverse problems and move beyond treating them as black boxes.

Method: Derives Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE) incorporating CNN inductive biases (translation equivariance, locality) and validates it through experiments.

Result: LE-MMSE matches CNN outputs (PSNR ≥25dB) and provides insights into physics-aware vs. physics-agnostic estimators and training distribution effects.

Conclusion: LE-MMSE offers an interpretable framework for CNNs in inverse problems, bridging theory and practice.

Abstract: Supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to solve imaging inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in numerous applications. However, despite their empirical success, these methods are poorly understood from a theoretical perspective and often treated as black boxes. To bridge this gap, we analyze trained neural networks through the lens of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, incorporating functional constraints that capture two fundamental inductive biases of CNNs: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. Under the empirical training distribution, we derive an analytic, interpretable, and tractable formula for this constrained variant, termed Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE). Through extensive numerical experiments across various inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP), we demonstrate that our theory matches the neural networks outputs (PSNR $\gtrsim25$dB). Furthermore, we provide insights into the differences between \emph{physics-aware} and \emph{physics-agnostic} estimators, the impact of high-density regions in the training (patch) distribution, and the influence of other factors (dataset size, patch size, etc).

Method: Developed HPE-Bench with 1,700 samples from 17 models, and proposed a unified framework using multimodal large language models with contrastive LoRA tuning and layer sensitivity analysis.

Result: The framework excels in authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, unifying forensic detection and quality assessment.

Conclusion: HPE-Bench and the proposed framework effectively address the limitations of existing evaluation methods, improving performance in pose evaluation.

Abstract: Text-guided human pose editing has gained significant traction in AIGC applications. However,it remains plagued by structural anomalies and generative artifacts. Existing evaluation metrics often isolate authenticity detection from quality assessment, failing to provide fine-grained insights into pose-specific inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce HPE-Bench, a specialized benchmark comprising 1,700 standardized samples from 17 state-of-the-art editing models, offering both authenticity labels and multi-dimensional quality scores. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework based on layer-selective multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By employing contrastive LoRA tuning and a novel layer sensitivity analysis (LSA) mechanism, we identify the optimal feature layer for pose evaluation. Our framework achieves superior performance in both authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, effectively bridging the gap between forensic detection and quality assessment.

TL;DR: DiffCR introduces a novel diffusion-based image compression framework with faster sampling and better bit allocation, achieving significant bitrate savings and speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based image compression methods suffer from slow sampling and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms.

Method: DiffCR uses a Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module and Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA) to refine priors and align latents. A lightweight consistency estimator enables fast two-step decoding.

Result: DiffCR achieves 27.2% BD-rate savings (LPIPS), 65.1% BD-rate savings (PSNR), and a 10× speed-up compared to SOTA baselines without updating the backbone model.

Conclusion: DiffCR demonstrates efficient and high-fidelity image compression by refining diffusion priors and improving sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based generative priors have enabled visually plausible image compression at extremely low bit rates. However, existing approaches suffer from slow sampling processes and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms. In this work, we propose Accelerate \textbf{Diff}usion-based Image Compression via \textbf{C}onsistency Prior \textbf{R}efinement (DiffCR), a novel compression framework for efficient and high-fidelity image reconstruction. At the heart of DiffCR is a Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module that refines the $ε$-prediction prior from a pre-trained latent diffusion model and aligns it with compressed latents at different timesteps via Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA). Furthermore, a lightweight consistency estimator enables fast \textbf{two-step decoding} by preserving the semantic trajectory of diffusion sampling. Without updating the backbone diffusion model, DiffCR achieves substantial bitrate savings (27.2\% BD-rate (LPIPS) and 65.1\% BD-rate (PSNR)) and over $10\times$ speed-up compared to SOTA diffusion-based compression baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIST2 is a novel Transformer model that compresses text globally by interleaving text chunks with visual encodings, reducing computational and memory costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of partial compression in vision-language models by introducing global context compression for both prefilling and token-by-token inference stages.

Method: Proposes VIST2, which interleaves text chunks with visual encodings and relies on visual tokens for predicting next text tokens. Includes curriculum-scheduled pretraining and modal-interleaved instruction tuning.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: 3× speedup in first-token generation, 77% memory reduction, and 74% FLOPS reduction with a 4× compression ratio.

Conclusion: VIST2 demonstrates superior performance over baselines in long writing tasks, offering efficient global compression solutions for textual information.

Abstract: Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.

TL;DR: A missing-aware multimodal survival framework integrates CT, WSI, and clinical data for NSCLC survival prediction, outperforming unimodal and other fusion strategies, especially combining WSI and clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate survival prediction for NSCLC requires integrating diverse data types, but small cohorts and missing modalities limit MDL's clinical use.

Method: Leverages Foundation Models for feature extraction and employs a missing-aware encoding strategy for intermediate multimodal fusion under incomplete data.

Result: Intermediate fusion performs best (73.30 C-index), with WSI and clinical data showing strongest impact, while less informative modalities like CT are down-weighted.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles missing modalities, improves survival prediction, and adaptively weights modalities for optimal performance.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) requires the integration of heterogeneous clinical, radiological, and histopathological information. While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.

Conclusion: The pipeline is versatile for other imaging domains needing multi-temporal fusion for better annotation and segmentation.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is widely employed for the analysis of living biological samples; however, the utility of the resulting recordings is frequently constrained by noise, temporal variability, and inconsistent visualisation of signals that oscillate over time. We present a unique computational framework that integrates information from multiple time-resolved frames into a single high-quality image, while preserving the underlying biological content of the original video. We evaluate the proposed method through an extensive number of configurations (n = 111) and on a challenging dataset comprising dynamic, heterogeneous, and morphologically complex 2D monolayers of cardiac cells. Results show that our framework, which consists of a combination of explainable techniques from different computer vision application fields, is capable of generating composite images that preserve and enhance the quality and information of individual microscopy frames, yielding 44% average increase in cell count compared to previous methods. The proposed pipeline is applicable to other imaging domains that require the fusion of multi-temporal image stacks into high-quality 2D images, thereby facilitating annotation and downstream segmentation.

Motivation: Existing lunar rendering pipelines use simplified BRDF models that lack local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism and accuracy for rendering and navigation.

Method: Proposes Lunar-G2R, a learning framework that predicts BRDF parameters from DEMs using a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering, eliminating the need for multi-view imagery or specialized hardware.

Result: Achieves 38% lower photometric error, higher PSNR and SSIM, and better perceptual similarity compared to baselines, capturing fine-scale reflectance details.

Conclusion: Lunar-G2R is the first method to infer spatially varying reflectance directly from terrain geometry, offering improved realism for lunar rendering and vision tasks.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating realistic, spatially varying reflectance for complex planetary surfaces such as the lunar regolith, which is critical for high-fidelity rendering and vision-based navigation. Existing lunar rendering pipelines rely on simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models whose parameters are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism. We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to infer a spatially varying reflectance model directly from terrain geometry.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset and framework for socio-semantic segmentation of urban entities using vision-language models and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation models excel at physically defined urban entities (e.g., buildings) but struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools). This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes the SocioSeg dataset (satellite imagery, maps, and hierarchical labels) and the SocioReasoner framework, which uses vision-language model reasoning and reinforcement learning for multi-stage reasoning.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art models and shows strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: The work advances socio-semantic segmentation by leveraging vision-language models and provides a new dataset and framework for future research.

Abstract: As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.

TL;DR: MERGETUNE introduces continued fine-tuning (CFT) to recover pretrained knowledge post zero-shot adaptation, using LMC-guided optimization without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in VLMs like CLIP by recovering lost pretrained knowledge after fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes MERGETUNE, a model-agnostic CFT strategy exploiting LMC geometry to merge zero-shot and fine-tuned solutions without data replay.

Result: Improves CoOp's harmonic mean by +5.6%, achieves state-of-the-art results in robust fine-tuning, and surpasses CLIP performance on DTD and EuroSAT.

Conclusion: MERGETUNE effectively restores lost pretrained knowledge, enhancing generalization and robustness without added parameters.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, \emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SatMap, a method for online HD map construction in autonomous driving by integrating satellite maps with camera observations, improving accuracy and mitigating depth ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of camera-based HD map construction, such as depth perception and occlusion issues, by leveraging satellite imagery for better accuracy.

Method: The method combines satellite maps (providing lane-level semantics and texture from a BEV perspective) with multi-view camera observations to directly predict vectorized HD maps.

Result: SatMap outperforms camera-only and camera-LiDAR fusion baselines by 34.8% and 8.5% mAP, respectively, and shows robustness in long-range and adverse weather conditions.

Conclusion: The integration of satellite imagery significantly improves HD map estimation, offering a more reliable solution for autonomous driving pipelines.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is an essential part of a safe and robust end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) pipeline. Onboard camera-based approaches suffer from limited depth perception and degraded accuracy due to occlusion. In this work, we propose SatMap, an online vectorized HD map estimation method that integrates satellite maps with multi-view camera observations and directly predicts a vectorized HD map for downstream prediction and planning modules. Our method leverages lane-level semantics and texture from satellite imagery captured from a Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective as a global prior, effectively mitigating depth ambiguity and occlusion. In our experiments on the nuScenes dataset, SatMap achieves 34.8% mAP performance improvement over the camera-only baseline and 8.5% mAP improvement over the camera-LiDAR fusion baseline. Moreover, we evaluate our model in long-range and adverse weather conditions to demonstrate the advantages of using a satellite prior map.

Abstract: Anticipating the intentions of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) is a critical challenge for safe autonomous driving (AD) and mobile robotics. While current research predominantly focuses on pedestrian crossing behaviors from a vehicle's perspective, interactions within dense shared spaces remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce FUSE-Bike, the first fully open perception platform of its kind. Equipped with two LiDARs, a camera, and GNSS, it facilitates high-fidelity, close-range data capture directly from a cyclist's viewpoint. Leveraging this platform, we present BikeActions, a novel multi-modal dataset comprising 852 annotated samples across 5 distinct action classes, specifically tailored to improve VRU behavior modeling. We establish a rigorous benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art graph convolution and transformer-based models on our publicly released data splits, establishing the first performance baselines for this challenging task. We release the full dataset together with data curation tools, the open hardware design, and the benchmark code to foster future research in VRU action understanding under https://iv.ee.hm.edu/bikeactions/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations like robustness, localization accuracy, and fine-grained state understanding in digital twin creation using sparse imagery.

Method: The framework combines LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection, spatial-attention matching, geometry-guided refinement, and a Vision-Language Model agent for operational state diagnosis.

Result: Experiments show SVII-3D improves identification accuracy and reduces localization errors, achieving decimeter-level precision.

Conclusion: SVII-3D provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization, bridging sparse perception and automated maintenance.

Abstract: The automated creation of digital twins and precise asset inventories is a critical task in smart city construction and facility lifecycle management. However, utilizing cost-effective sparse imagery remains challenging due to limited robustness, inaccurate localization, and a lack of fine-grained state understanding. To address these limitations, SVII-3D, a unified framework for holistic asset digitization, is proposed. First, LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection is fused with a spatial-attention matching network to robustly associate observations across sparse views. Second, a geometry-guided refinement mechanism is introduced to resolve structural errors, achieving precise decimeter-level 3D localization. Third, transcending static geometric mapping, a Vision-Language Model agent leveraging multi-modal prompting is incorporated to automatically diagnose fine-grained operational states. Experiments demonstrate that SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors. Consequently, this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization, effectively bridging the gap between sparse perception and automated intelligent maintenance.

TL;DR: Deep learning models FFA-Net and AECR-Net improve visibility of gauge images in hazy/smoky environments, with synthetic datasets showing promising results, especially for haze removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing visibility of gauge images in smoky/hazy conditions aids infrastructure monitoring and emergency response by enabling accurate machine-based gauge readings.

Method: Utilized FFA-Net and AECR-Net architectures on a synthetic dataset (14,000+ images) created with Unreal Engine, split 80-10-10 for training, validation, and testing.

Result: SSIM (~0.98) and PSNR (~43 dB) metrics for haze removal match state-of-the-art; AECR-Net outperforms FFA-Net. Smoke removal is harder due to inhomogeneity.

Conclusion: Deep learning can significantly enhance gauge images in smoke/haze, though smoke remains challenging. Enhanced images enable successful automatic gauge reading.

Abstract: Images captured in hazy and smoky environments suffer from reduced visibility, posing a challenge when monitoring infrastructures and hindering emergency services during critical situations. The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\% train, 10\% validation, and 10\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-adapted framework enhances VLMs for accurate urban infrastructure analysis by combining fine-tuning, knowledge-grounded reasoning, and RAG to meet engineering standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose models fail to capture fine-grained infrastructure attributes and comply with domain rules, limiting real-world reliability.

Method: Uses open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO for localization and LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for semantic reasoning, augmented by dual-modality RAG for compliance.

Result: Achieves 58.9 mAP for detection and 95.5% accuracy for attribute recognition on urban roadside scenes.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust solution for intelligent infrastructure monitoring by integrating VLMs with domain-specific adaptations.

Abstract: Automated perception of urban roadside infrastructure is crucial for smart city management, yet general-purpose models often struggle to capture the necessary fine-grained attributes and domain rules. While Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at open-world recognition, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex facility states in compliance with engineering standards, leading to unreliable performance in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a domain-adapted framework that transforms VLMs into specialized agents for intelligent infrastructure analysis. Our approach integrates a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy with a knowledge-grounded reasoning mechanism. Specifically, we leverage open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO to robustly localize diverse assets with minimal supervision, followed by LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning. To mitigate hallucinations and enforce professional compliance, we introduce a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that dynamically retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference. Evaluated on a comprehensive new dataset of urban roadside scenes, our framework achieves a detection performance of 58.9 mAP and an attribute recognition accuracy of 95.5%, demonstrating a robust solution for intelligent infrastructure monitoring.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WMReward, an inference-time alignment method leveraging a latent world model (VJEPA-2) to improve physics plausibility in video generation by optimizing denoising trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generative models often violate physics principles, limiting their utility. The authors identify suboptimal inference strategies as a key issue, beyond just insufficient pre-training physics understanding.

Method: They propose WMReward, treating physics plausibility improvement as an inference-time alignment problem. Using VJEPA-2's physics prior as a reward, they search and steer multiple denoising trajectories to enhance generation performance.

Result: Empirical results show significant improvements in physics plausibility across various generation settings, validated by human preference studies. Their method achieved first place in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge with a score of 62.64%, outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of latent world models to enhance physics plausibility in video generation, extending beyond the specific implementation or parameterization.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.

Abstract: The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

*Serena Grazia De Benedictis,Amedeo Altavilla,Nicoletta Del Buono*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a topology-aware segmentation metric based on the Jordan Curve Theorem to evaluate structural coherence in image segmentation, addressing limitations of conventional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional segmentation metrics often fail to capture structural and topological coherence, leading to high scores despite inadequate masks. This is problematic in applications like medical imaging or object delineation where topological correctness is critical.

Method: The authors propose using the Jordan Curve Theorem adapted for digital planes, defining 'Jordan-segmentatable masks.' They analyze masks via digital topology and homology theory, verifying topological validity using Betti numbers (β₀ = β₁ = 1).

Result: The framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion to assess segmentation coherence, ensuring masks partition images into meaningful interior and exterior regions.

Conclusion: This approach offers a valuable alternative to conventional metrics, particularly in scenarios where preserving topological correctness is essential.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.

TL;DR: RSATalker leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting for realistic, socially-aware talking head generation in multi-turn conversations, outperforming existing methods in realism and social dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for talking head generation either lack realism or ignore social relationships, limiting their utility in VR social scenarios.

Method: RSATalker combines 3D facial motion driven by speech with 3D Gaussian rendering and a socially-aware module to encode relationships.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in realism and social awareness, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: RSATalker advances talking head generation by integrating realism and social dynamics, with plans to release code and dataset.

Abstract: Talking head generation is increasingly important in virtual reality (VR), especially for social scenarios involving multi-turn conversation. Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The code and dataset will be released.

TL;DR: Molmo2 introduces a new family of open-source video-language models with advanced grounding capabilities, outperforming existing models in tasks like video counting and pointing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open-source community lacks strong video-language models with grounding capabilities, hindering progress in tasks requiring pixel-level understanding. Molmo2 addresses this gap.

Method: Molmo2 uses 7 new video and 2 multi-image datasets, avoiding proprietary data. It employs an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, with bi-directional attention and a novel token-weight strategy.

Result: Molmo2's 8B model outperforms other open-weight models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) and even surpasses proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro) in tasks like video counting, pointing, and tracking.

Conclusion: Molmo2 advances open-source VLMs with its datasets and training method, offering competitive performance and new grounding capabilities.

Abstract: Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).

Method: CoMoVi uses a dual-branch diffusion model with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross-attentions. It introduces a 2D motion representation to leverage pre-trained video models and is supported by a new dataset (CoMoVi Dataset).

Result: Experiments show CoMoVi's effectiveness in generating both 3D human motions and 2D videos.

Conclusion: Coupling 3D motion and video generation improves performance, validated by the CoMoVi framework and dataset.

Abstract: In this paper, we find that the generation of 3D human motions and 2D human videos is intrinsically coupled. 3D motions provide the structural prior for plausibility and consistency in videos, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions, which necessitate coupling their generation processes. Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks.

TL;DR: CURVE is a multicultural, multilingual video reasoning benchmark addressing biases in current evaluations by using diverse cultural videos and native-language annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models exhibit biases due to western-centric data and dominant English language use, necessitating a more inclusive benchmark.

Method: CURVE includes human-generated annotations from diverse cultural videos across 18 locales, with complex questions and reasoning steps in native languages. It also uses reasoning traces to create evidence-based graphs for error analysis.

Result: State-of-the-art Video-LLMs perform significantly below human accuracy on CURVE, struggling with visual perception of cultural elements.

Conclusion: CURVE highlights the need for culturally aware video understanding and offers a tool for improving model performance in diverse contexts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video models have shown tremendous progress, particularly in long video understanding. However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements. CURVE will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva-cultural

TL;DR: A multimodal dataset digitizes over 13,200 ground beetles from NEON collections, enabling AI-driven trait extraction and broader ecological research access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Invertebrates, like ground beetles, are underrepresented in global trait databases, limiting ecological analyses of high-diversity groups.

Method: Digitized specimens through high-resolution imaging and digitally measured elytra length and width, validated against manual measurements.

Result: Achieved sub-millimeter precision in trait extraction, supporting reliable automated analysis and species identification.

Conclusion: This dataset bridges gaps in invertebrate trait representation, aiding biodiversity monitoring and conservation through AI-driven tools.

Abstract: Despite the ecological significance of invertebrates, global trait databases remain heavily biased toward vertebrates and plants, limiting comprehensive ecological analyses of high-diversity groups like ground beetles. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) serve as critical bioindicators of ecosystem health, providing valuable insights into biodiversity shifts driven by environmental changes. While the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) maintains an extensive collection of carabid specimens from across the United States, these primarily exist as physical collections, restricting widespread research access and large-scale analysis. To address these gaps, we present a multimodal dataset digitizing over 13,200 NEON carabids from 30 sites spanning the continental US and Hawaii through high-resolution imaging, enabling broader access and computational analysis. The dataset includes digitally measured elytra length and width of each specimen, establishing a foundation for automated trait extraction using AI. Validated against manual measurements, our digital trait extraction achieves sub-millimeter precision, ensuring reliability for ecological and computational studies. By addressing invertebrate under-representation in trait databases, this work supports AI-driven tools for automated species identification and trait-based research, fostering advancements in biodiversity monitoring and conservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPS improves OOD robustness in autonomous driving by randomly masking patch descriptors to reduce feature redundancy and overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the redundancy in patch-aligned features and improve Out-of-Distribution robustness in autonomous driving policies.

Method: Introduces Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), which randomly masks patch descriptors while preserving spatial layout, forcing the policy to rely on invariant features.

Result: Achieves a 6.2% average improvement in OOD scenarios, up to 20.4% in closed-loop simulations, and is 2.4× faster.

Conclusion: SPS enhances robustness, generalizability, and efficiency, with successful real-world transfer without tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.

*Cheng Chen,Yuyu Guo,Pengpeng Zeng,Jingkuan Song,Peng Di,Hang Yu,Lianli Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a lightweight framework addressing the bottleneck in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by dynamically connecting vision and language modalities for deeper alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs suffer from a visual feature bottleneck due to static connections between vision encoders and LLMs, limiting their ability to integrate hierarchical visual knowledge.

Method: Introduces CLI with Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) and Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) modules to create dynamic, many-to-many connections between vision and language modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on 18 benchmarks show significant performance improvements when integrating CLI into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5.

Conclusion: CLI is a scalable solution enhancing multimodal understanding by enabling LLMs to access hierarchical visual features dynamically.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) create a severe visual feature bottleneck by using a crude, asymmetric connection that links only the output of the vision encoder to the input of the large language model (LLM). This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.

*Tal Reiss,Daniel Winter,Matan Cohen,Alex Rav-Acha,Yael Pritch,Ariel Shamir,Yedid Hoshen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Alterbute is a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes (color, texture, material, shape) in images while preserving identity and scene context. It uses relaxed training objectives and Visual Named Entities (VNEs) for scalable supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either fail to preserve identity or restrict intrinsic variations excessively, necessitating a better approach for identity-preserving intrinsic attribute editing.

Method: The method uses a relaxed training objective conditioned on identity reference, textual prompt, and extrinsic context. At inference, extrinsic changes are restricted by reusing the original background and mask. VNEs automate supervision via vision-language models.

Result: Alterbute outperforms existing methods in identity-preserving intrinsic attribute editing.

Conclusion: Alterbute effectively edits intrinsic attributes while preserving identity and context, leveraging scalable supervision through VNEs.

Abstract: We introduce Alterbute, a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes in an image. We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WildRayZer is a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis in dynamic scenes, addressing ghosting and unstable poses by leveraging residuals and motion masks. It outperforms baselines with a single feed-forward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic environments disrupt multi-view consistency in static NVS models, causing issues like ghosting and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer aims to solve these challenges.

Method: The framework uses an analysis-by-synthesis test, with residuals revealing transient regions. It constructs motion masks, distills a motion estimator, and gates loss gradients to focus on background completion.

Result: WildRayZer outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality.

Conclusion: WildRayZer effectively handles dynamic scenes with a single feed-forward pass, validated by experiments on curated datasets.

Abstract: We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProUtt is a method for predicting next utterances in dialogues by modeling intent reasoning and synthesizing preference data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and computational cost issues in existing solutions for predicting next utterances and improve dialogue advancement.

Method: ProUtt converts dialogue history into an intent tree, models reasoning trajectories, and synthesizes preference data by perturbing paths.

Result: ProUtt outperforms existing methods in evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge and human judgments.

Conclusion: ProUtt offers a practical solution for proactive next utterance prediction, with released code and datasets for future research.

Abstract: Proactively predicting a users next utterance in human-machine dialogue can streamline interaction and improve user experience. Existing commercial API-based solutions are subject to privacy concerns while deploying general-purpose LLMs locally remains computationally expensive. As such, training a compact, task-specific LLM provides a practical alternative. Although user simulator methods can predict a user's next utterance, they mainly imitate their speaking style rather than advancing the dialogue. Preference data synthesis has been investigated to generate data for proactive next utterance prediction and help align LLMs with user preferences. Yet existing methods lack the ability to explicitly model the intent reasoning that leads to the user's next utterance and to define and synthesize preference and non-preference reasoning processes for predicting the user's next utterance.To address these challenges, we propose ProUtt, an LLM-driven preference data synthesis method for proactive next utterance prediction. ProUtt converts dialogue history into an intent tree and explicitly models intent reasoning trajectories by predicting the next plausible path from both exploitation and exploration perspectives. It then constructs preference and non-preference reasoning processes by perturbing or revising intent tree paths at different future turns. Extensive evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge and human judgments demonstrate that ProUtt consistently outperforms existing data synthesis methods, user simulators, and commercial LLM APIs across four benchmark datasets. We release both the code and the synthesized datasets to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: Carefully designed multi-stage agentic workflows can enhance AI-assisted research ideation, balancing novelty and feasibility.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the scientific ecosystem raises fundamental questions about the creativity and originality of AI-generated research. Recent work has identified ``smart plagiarism'' as a concern in single-step prompting approaches, where models reproduce existing ideas with terminological shifts. This paper investigates whether agentic workflows -- multi-step systems employing iterative reasoning, evolutionary search, and recursive decomposition -- can generate more novel and feasible research plans. We benchmark five reasoning architectures: Reflection-based iterative refinement, Sakana AI v2 evolutionary algorithms, Google Co-Scientist multi-agent framework, GPT Deep Research (GPT-5.1) recursive decomposition, and Gemini~3 Pro multimodal long-context pipeline. Using evaluations from thirty proposals each on novelty, feasibility, and impact, we find that decomposition-based and long-context workflows achieve mean novelty of 4.17/5, while reflection-based approaches score significantly lower (2.33/5). Results reveal varied performance across research domains, with high-performing workflows maintaining feasibility without sacrificing creativity. These findings support the view that carefully designed multi-stage agentic workflows can advance AI-assisted research ideation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a resource-efficient statistical LLM by leveraging lightweight models and optimized training pipelines.

Method: Compares three multi-stage training pipelines (base FM, base FM with instruction tuning, instruction-tuned FM) through continual pretraining, SFT, RLHF alignment, and downstream task adaptation.

Result: Pipelines starting with a base FM failed in statistical reasoning, while instruction-tuned LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct succeeded. Direct preference optimization proved effective, and low-intensity downstream tuning prevented catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: StatLLaMA balances domain expertise and general reasoning, providing a practical blueprint for efficient statistical LLMs.

Abstract: This study investigates how to efficiently build a domain-specialized large language model (LLM) for statistics using the lightweight LLaMA-3.2-3B family as the foundation model (FM). We systematically compare three multi-stage training pipelines, starting from a base FM with no instruction-following capability, a base FM augmented with post-hoc instruction tuning, and an instruction-tuned FM with strong general reasoning abilities across continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) preference alignment, and downstream task adaptation. Results show that pipelines beginning with a base FM fail to develop meaningful statistical reasoning, even after extensive instruction tuning, SFT, or RLHF alignment. In contrast, starting from LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct enables effective domain specialization. A comprehensive evaluation of SFT variants reveals clear trade-offs between domain expertise and general reasoning ability. We further demonstrate that direct preference optimization provides stable and effective RLHF preference alignment. Finally, we show that downstream fine-tuning must be performed with extremely low intensity to avoid catastrophic forgetting in highly optimized models. The final model, StatLLaMA, achieves strong and balanced performance on benchmarks of mathematical reasoning, common-sense reasoning, and statistical expertise, offering a practical blueprint for developing resource-efficient statistical LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/HuangDLab/StatLLaMA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BHyT is proposed as a stable and efficient alternative to Pre-LN in LLMs, addressing activation instability and speed issues while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-LN inefficiencies and instability at depth motivate the need for a solution that balances stability and speed.

Method: BHyT combines tanh nonlinearity with input bounding and replaces dual normalization with lightweight variance approximation.

Result: BHyT improves training speed by 15.8%, increases throughput by 4.2%, and matches or outperforms RMSNorm benchmarks.

Conclusion: BHyT effectively addresses stability and efficiency issues in Pre-LN, offering a robust solution for LLMs.

Abstract: Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) is the de facto choice for large language models (LLMs) and is crucial for stable pretraining and effective transfer learning. However, Pre-LN is inefficient due to repeated statistical calculations and suffers from the curse of depth. As layers grow, the magnitude and variance of the hidden state escalate, destabilizing training. Efficiency-oriented normalization-free methods such as Dynamic Tanh (DyT) improve speed but remain fragile at depth. To jointly address stability and efficiency, we propose Bounded Hyperbolic Tanh (BHyT), a drop-in replacement for Pre-LN. BHyT couples a tanh nonlinearity with explicit, data-driven input bounding to keep activations within a non-saturating range. It prevents depth-wise growth in activation magnitude and variance and comes with a theoretical stability guarantee. For efficiency, BHyT computes exact statistics once per block and replaces a second normalization with a lightweight variance approximation, enhancing efficiency. Empirically, BHyT demonstrates improved stability and efficiency during pretraining, achieving an average of 15.8% faster training and an average of 4.2% higher token generation throughput compared to RMSNorm., while matching or surpassing its inference performance and robustness across language understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: A framework introduces uncertainty-aware dynamic knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve QA reliability by incorporating evolving information, confidence scoring, and interactive interfaces, demonstrated in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KG-based QA systems treat facts as static and deterministic, missing the evolving nature and uncertainty of information, which undermines reliability.

Method: Combines dynamic KG construction, confidence scoring, uncertainty-aware retrieval, and an interactive QA interface.

Result: The framework enhances QA robustness and transparency, allowing users to explore dynamic graphs, inspect confidence-annotated triples, and compare answers.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs can significantly improve QA reliability, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are increasingly deployed across domains. However, their reliability is undermined when retrieved evidence is incomplete, noisy, or uncertain. Existing knowledge graph (KG) based QA frameworks typically represent facts as static and deterministic, failing to capture the evolving nature of information and the uncertainty inherent in reasoning. We present a demonstration of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs, a framework that combines (i) dynamic construction of evolving KGs, (ii) confidence scoring and uncertainty-aware retrieval, and (iii) an interactive interface for reliable and interpretable QA. Our system highlights how uncertainty modeling can make QA more robust and transparent by enabling users to explore dynamic graphs, inspect confidence-annotated triples, and compare baseline versus confidence-aware answers. The target users of this demo are clinical data scientists and clinicians, and we instantiate the framework in healthcare: constructing personalized KGs from electronic health records, visualizing uncertainty across patient visits, and evaluating its impact on a mortality prediction task. This use case demonstrates the broader promise of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs for enhancing QA reliability in high-stakes applications.

TL;DR: Study evaluates LLM safety under parental anxiety-driven pressures in pediatric consultations, finding smaller models outperform larger ones and highlighting vulnerabilities like inadequate emergency recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM safety under realistic adversarial pressures from anxious users, overlooked in prior neutral-condition studies.

Method: Used PediatricAnxietyBench (300 queries) to test three models (Llama-3.3-70B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) via APIs, scoring safety on restraint, referral, hedging, etc.

Result: Smaller models outperformed larger ones; safety depended on alignment/architecture. Vulnerabilities included seizures (33% inappropriate diagnoses) and poor emergency recognition.

Conclusion: Safety hinges on alignment/architecture, not scale. Findings stress adversarial testing, guide model selection, and provide an open benchmark for medical AI safety.

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical consultations, yet their safety under realistic user pressures remains understudied. Prior assessments focused on neutral conditions, overlooking vulnerabilities from anxious users challenging safeguards. This study evaluated LLM safety under parental anxiety-driven adversarial pressures in pediatric consultations across models and platforms. Methods PediatricAnxietyBench, from a prior evaluation, includes 300 queries (150 authentic, 150 adversarial) spanning 10 topics. Three models were assessed via APIs: Llama-3.3-70B and Llama-3.1-8B (Groq), Mistral-7B (HuggingFace), yielding 900 responses. Safety used a 0-15 scale for restraint, referral, hedging, emergency recognition, and non-prescriptive behavior. Analyses employed paired t-tests with bootstrapped CIs. Results Mean scores: 9.70 (Llama-3.3-70B) to 10.39 (Mistral-7B). Llama-3.1-8B outperformed Llama-3.3-70B by +0.66 (p=0.0001, d=0.225). Models showed positive adversarial effects, Mistral-7B strongest (+1.09, p=0.0002). Safety generalized across platforms; Llama-3.3-70B had 8% failures. Seizures vulnerable (33% inappropriate diagnoses). Hedging predicted safety (r=0.68, p<0.001). Conclusions Evaluation shows safety depends on alignment and architecture over scale, with smaller models outperforming larger. Evolution to robustness across releases suggests targeted training progress. Vulnerabilities and no emergency recognition indicate unsuitability for triage.

### [74] [ADMEDTAGGER: an annotation framework for distillation of expert knowledge for the Polish medical language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09722)
*Franciszek Górski,Andrzej Czyżewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multilingual LLM (Llama3.1) was used to annotate Polish medical texts due to lack of resources. Verified labels trained BERT-based classifiers, with DistilBERT performing best (>0.80 F1).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of resources for annotating Polish medical texts by leveraging a multilingual LLM as a teacher model.

Method: Used Llama3.1 for annotation, verified labels manually, and trained DistilBERT, BioBERT, and HerBERT classifiers.

Result: DistilBERT achieved F1 >0.80 for all categories and >0.93 for three, outperforming other models with smaller size and faster inference.

Conclusion: The framework provides efficient classifiers as alternatives to large LLMs, with significant resource savings.

Abstract: In this work, we present an annotation framework that demonstrates how a multilingual LLM pretrained on a large corpus can be used as a teacher model to distill the expert knowledge needed for tagging medical texts in Polish. This work is part of a larger project called ADMEDVOICE, within which we collected an extensive corpus of medical texts representing five clinical categories - Radiology, Oncology, Cardiology, Hypertension, and Pathology. Using this data, we had to develop a multi-class classifier, but the fundamental problem turned out to be the lack of resources for annotating an adequate number of texts. Therefore, in our solution, we used the multilingual Llama3.1 model to annotate an extensive corpus of medical texts in Polish. Using our limited annotation resources, we verified only a portion of these labels, creating a test set from them. The data annotated in this way were then used for training and validation of 3 different types of classifiers based on the BERT architecture - the distilled DistilBERT model, BioBERT fine-tuned on medical data, and HerBERT fine-tuned on the Polish language corpus. Among the models we trained, the DistilBERT model achieved the best results, reaching an F1 score > 0.80 for each clinical category and an F1 score > 0.93 for 3 of them. In this way, we obtained a series of highly effective classifiers that represent an alternative to large language models, due to their nearly 500 times smaller size, 300 times lower GPU VRAM consumption, and several hundred times faster inference.

### [75] [SagaScale: A Realistic, Scalable, and High-Quality Long-Context Benchmark Built from Full-Length Novels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09723)
*Guancheng Du,Yong Hu,Wenqing Wang,Yaming Yang,Jiaheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SagaScale is a bilingual, realistic, and scalable long-context benchmark built from novels to evaluate LLMs' performance on lengthy documents, revealing key insights about context handling and retrieval methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-context benchmarks lack realism, scalability, and quality, prompting the creation of SagaScale to address these gaps.

Method: SagaScale uses an automated pipeline to collect question-answer pairs from full-length novels, leveraging external resources for curation but not evaluation, ensuring complex questions.

Result: Evaluation of 12 LLMs showed full-context supply outperforms other methods, most struggle with long contexts (except Gemini-2.5-Pro), and Agentic RAG improves retrieval bottlenecks.

Conclusion: SagaScale advances long-context evaluation, highlighting LLM limitations and solution effectiveness, with public release fostering further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress, but understanding long and complex documents remains challenging. Many long-context benchmarks have been proposed, but they face several limitations, including task realism, data scalability, and data quality. To this end, we introduce SagaScale, a realistic, scalable, and high-quality long-context benchmark built from full-length novels. The entire benchmark is constructed using an automated data collection pipeline that utilizes external resources (e.g., Wikipedia pages) to curate question-answer pairs. Critically, these external resources are provided only for benchmark construction and not during evaluation, which allows LLMs to curate complex questions that go beyond what they can answer during evaluation. SagaScale is also bilingual and offers the largest context length to date, with average token counts exceeding 250K for English novels and 320K for Chinese novels. Our evaluation across 12 frontier LLMs and three long-context methods -- Naïve RAG, Agentic RAG, and Long Context -- yields key insights, including: (1) Directly supplying the full context to the LLM can outperform other methods by a large margin; (2) Most LLMs still struggle with lengthy contexts, but Gemini-2.5-Pro stands out as an exception; and (3) Agentic RAG effectively addresses the retrieval bottleneck in Naïve RAG. Finally, we publicly release the SagaScale benchmark and our data collection codebase to facilitate future research.

### [76] [Syntactic Framing Fragility: An Audit of Robustness in LLM Ethical Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09724)
*Katherine Elkins,Jon Chun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLMs' ethical judgments vary with syntactically different but logically equivalent prompts, introducing a framework (SFF) to measure this inconsistency. Findings show significant fragility, especially in open-source models, and suggest chain-of-thought reasoning as a mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the robustness of LLMs' ethical judgments across syntactic variations, particularly focusing on negation and conditional structures, which is underexplored despite their deployment in critical decision-making contexts.

Method: Introduces Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF) and Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN) to isolate syntactic effects. Audits 23 models across ethical scenarios and framings (39,975 decisions).

Result: Found widespread inconsistency, with open-source models twice as fragile as commercial ones. Extreme negation sensitivity observed (80-97% endorsement with "should not"). Chain-of-thought reasoning mitigates fragility.

Conclusion: Syntactic consistency is crucial for ethical robustness. SFF-style audits should be standard for LLM safety evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential decision-making settings, yet their robustness to benign prompt variation remains underexplored. In this work, we study whether LLMs maintain consistent ethical judgments across logically equivalent but syntactically different prompts, focusing on variations involving negation and conditional structure. We introduce Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF), a robustness evaluation framework that isolates purely syntactic effects via Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN), enabling direct comparison of decisions across positive and negative framings without semantic drift. Auditing 23 state-of-the-art models spanning the U.S. and China as well as small U.S. open-source software models over 14 ethical scenarios and four controlled framings (39,975 decisions), we find widespread and statistically significant inconsistency: many models reverse ethical endorsements solely due to syntactic polarity, with open-source models exhibiting over twice the fragility of commercial counterparts. We further uncover extreme negation sensitivity, where some models endorse actions in 80-97% of cases when explicitly prompted with "should not." We show that eliciting chain-of-thought reasoning substantially reduces fragility, identifying a practical mitigation lever, and we map fragility across scenarios, finding higher risk in financial and business contexts than in medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that syntactic consistency constitutes a distinct and critical dimension of ethical robustness, and we argue that SFF-style audits should be a standard component of safety evaluation for deployed LLMs. Code and results will be available on github.com.

*Kaustubh Shivshankar Shejole,Sourabh Deoghare,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Virām is the first diagnostic benchmark for punctuation robustness in English-to-Marathi MT, showing fine-tuned and pipeline approaches outperform standard and LLM methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Punctuation ambiguity affects MT reliability, especially in low-resource languages like Marathi.

Method: Evaluated two strategies: restore-then-translate pipeline and fine-tuning on punctuation-varied data.

Result: Fine-tuned models and pipeline systems improved translation quality; LLMs underperformed.

Conclusion: Task-specific approaches enhance MT reliability for punctuation ambiguity, highlighting LLMs' limitations.

Abstract: Punctuation plays a critical role in resolving semantic and structural ambiguity in written language. Machine Translation (MT) systems are now widely applied across diverse domains and languages, including many low-resource settings. In this work, we focus on Marathi, a low- to middle-resource language. We introduce Virām, the first diagnostic benchmark for assessing punctuation robustness in English-to-Marathi machine translation, consisting of 54 manually curated, punctuation-ambiguous instances. We evaluate two primary strategies for enhancing reliability: a pipeline-based restore-then-translate approach and direct fine-tuned on punctuation-varied data. Our results demonstrate that specialized fine-tuned models and pipeline systems significantly improve translation quality over standard baselines on the Virām benchmark. Qualitative analysis reveals that the original model may result in wrong translations leading to wrong interpretations, while fine-tuned models significantly improve overall reliability. Furthermore, we find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) lag behind these task-specific approaches in preserving meaning for punctuation-ambiguous text, thus necessitating further research in this area.

*Hien Tran,Quinten Steenhuis,Alexandros Christoforos,Chadbourne Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' forgetting behavior is reinterpreted as functional, modeled via probabilistic memory with exponential decay, improving reasoning performance through human-like memory mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the view of LLM forgetting as a limitation by demonstrating its functional role in adaptive reasoning, inspired by human memory dynamics.

Method: Model LLM inference as a probabilistic memory process with exponential decay, introduce a benchmark for temporal reasoning, concept drift, and associative recall, and propose probabilistic memory prompting.

Result: LLMs show forgetting rates similar to human memory trade-offs, and probabilistic memory prompting enhances long-horizon reasoning.

Conclusion: Forgetting is a principled mechanism for adaptive intelligence in LLMs, not a failure mode.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often evaluated against ideals of perfect Bayesian inference, yet growing evidence suggests that their in-context reasoning exhibits systematic forgetting of past information. Rather than viewing this behavior as a limitation, we reinterpret forgetting as a functional cognitive mechanism. Drawing inspiration from human memory dynamics, we model LLM inference as a probabilistic memory process governed by exponential decay. We introduce a benchmark suite that evaluates temporal reasoning, concept drift adaptation, and associative recall, enabling direct comparison between model behavior and human cognitive patterns. Our empirical results reveal that LLMs demonstrate forgetting rates analogous to human memory efficiency trade-offs between stability and adaptability. Building on these observations, we propose probabilistic memory prompting, a lightweight strategy that shapes evidence integration to mimic human-like memory decay, leading to improved long-horizon reasoning performance. Our findings position forgetting not as a failure mode, but as a principled mechanism for adaptive intelligence.

### [79] [SciNets: Graph-Constrained Multi-Hop Reasoning for Scientific Literature Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09727)
*Sauhard Dubey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciNets uses graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning over concept graphs for scientific synthesis, balancing reasoning depth and grounding stability across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of connecting mechanistic explanations across fragmented scientific literature with controlled reasoning depth and structural grounding.

Method: Constructs directed concept graphs from query-local corpora and evaluates multi-hop reasoning paths (shortest-path, k-shortest paths, random walks) compared to retrieval-augmented language models.

Result: Graph constraints enable deeper, diverse reasoning but increase grounding instability; shortest-path reasoning is stable but conservative.

Conclusion: Graph-LLM integration offers controllable scientific synthesis but reveals trade-offs between reasoning depth and grounding stability.

Abstract: Cross-domain scientific synthesis requires connecting mechanistic explanations across fragmented literature, a capability that remains challenging for both retrieval-based systems and unconstrained language models. While recent work has applied large language models to scientific summarization and question answering, these approaches provide limited control over reasoning depth and structural grounding. We frame mechanistic synthesis as a graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning problem over literature-derived concept graphs. Given a scientific query and a compact, query-local corpus, SciNets constructs a directed concept graph and synthesizes mechanistic explanations by identifying multi-hop reasoning paths that connect concepts that rarely co-occur within individual papers. We systematically compare shortest-path reasoning, k-shortest paths with diversity constraints, stochastic random walks, and a retrieval-augmented language model baseline. Rather than evaluating correctness, which is often indeterminate when synthesizing connections across distributed sources, we introduce a behavioral framework that measures symbolic reasoning depth, mechanistic diversity, and grounding stability. Across machine learning, biology, and climate science tasks, explicit graph constraints enable controllable multi-hop reasoning while revealing a consistent trade-off: deeper and more diverse symbolic reasoning increases grounding instability, whereas shortest-path reasoning remains highly stable but structurally conservative. These findings provide a systematic behavioral characterization of the limits and capabilities of current graph-LLM integration for scientific synthesis.

### [80] [Eliminating Agentic Workflow for Introduction Generation with Parametric Stage Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09728)
*Meicong Zhang,Tiancheng su,Guoxiu He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STIG improves LLM-generated research introductions by embedding workflow logic into the model, eliminating external workflows, and enhancing coherence and logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic workflows for LLM-generated introductions suffer from long reasoning chains, error accumulation, and reduced coherence.

Method: Proposes STIG, embedding workflow stages into the LLM via stage tokens and instruction tuning to generate introductions in a single inference.

Result: STIG outperforms traditional workflows in semantic similarity and structural rationality without explicit workflow calls.

Conclusion: STIG effectively generates coherent, logically structured introductions by internalizing workflow stages into the LLM.

Abstract: In recent years, using predefined agentic workflows to guide large language models (LLMs) for literature classification and review has become a research focus. However, writing research introductions is more challenging. It requires rigorous logic, coherent structure, and abstract summarization. Existing workflows often suffer from long reasoning chains, error accumulation, and reduced textual coherence. To address these limitations, we propose eliminating external agentic workflows. Instead, we directly parameterize their logical structure into the LLM. This allows the generation of a complete introduction in a single inference. To this end, we introduce the Stage Token for Introduction Generation (STIG). STIG converts the multiple stages of the original workflow into explicit stage signals. These signals guide the model to follow different logical roles and functions during generation. Through instruction tuning, the model learns the mapping between stage tokens and text functions. It also learns the logical order and transition patterns between stages, encoding this knowledge into the model parameters. Experimental results show that STIG can generate multi-stage text in a single inference. It does not require explicit workflow calls. STIG outperforms traditional agentic workflows and other baselines on metrics of semantic similarity and sentence-level structural rationality. The code is provided in the Supplementary Materials.

### [81] [Enhancing Business Analytics through Hybrid Summarization of Financial Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09729)
*Tohida Rehman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid summarization framework combines extractive and abstractive techniques to create concise, reliable summaries from earnings call transcripts, balancing performance and factual accuracy under computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of financial texts like earnings call transcripts is inefficient and error-prone, necessitating automated solutions for reliable summarization.

Method: A two-stage pipeline uses LexRank for salient sentence extraction, followed by fine-tuned BART and PEGASUS models. A Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED) is also fine-tuned for long-range context capture.

Result: Long-context models perform best overall, while the hybrid framework matches competitiveness with better factual consistency under computational limits.

Conclusion: The study supports practical summarization systems for financial texts, offering efficient business insights.

Abstract: Financial reports and earnings communications contain large volumes of structured and semi structured information, making detailed manual analysis inefficient. Earnings conference calls provide valuable evidence about a firm's performance, outlook, and strategic priorities. The manual analysis of lengthy call transcripts requires substantial effort and is susceptible to interpretive bias and unintentional error. In this work, we present a hybrid summarization framework that combines extractive and abstractive techniques to produce concise and factually reliable Reuters-style summaries from the ECTSum dataset. The proposed two stage pipeline first applies the LexRank algorithm to identify salient sentences, which are subsequently summarized using fine-tuned variants of BART and PEGASUS designed for resource constrained settings. In parallel, we fine-tune a Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED) model to directly capture long-range contextual dependencies in financial documents.
  Model performance is evaluated using standard automatic metrics, including ROUGE, METEOR, MoverScore, and BERTScore, along with domain-specific variants such as SciBERTScore and FinBERTScore. To assess factual accuracy, we further employ entity-level measures based on source-precision and F1-target. The results highlight complementary trade offs between approaches, long context models yield the strongest overall performance, while the hybrid framework achieves competitive results with improved factual consistency under computational constraints. These findings support the development of practical summarization systems for efficiently distilling lengthy financial texts into usable business insights.

### [82] [Geometric Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Multi-lingual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09731)
*Wen G Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-level analysis framework using Semanscope reveals systematic geometric patterns and limitations in multilingual embeddings across linguistic levels, validating PHATE manifold learning as a key tool for semantic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine semantic geometry in multilingual embeddings and validate embedding models' effectiveness in capturing semantic relationships.

Method: Implemented Semanscope, a visualization tool applying PHATE manifold learning across four linguistic levels (sub-character, character, word, and numerical concepts). Analyzed diverse datasets to uncover geometric patterns.

Result: Found geometric collapse at sub-character levels, distinct signatures across writing systems, clustering-branching patterns in content words, and spiral trajectories for Arabic numbers, highlighting model limitations.

Conclusion: PHATE manifold learning is essential for analyzing semantic geometry and validating embedding models, revealing critical insights into their strengths and limitations.

Abstract: We introduce a multi-level analysis framework for examining semantic geometry in multilingual embeddings, implemented through Semanscope (a visualization tool that applies PHATE manifold learning across four linguistic levels). Analysis of diverse datasets spanning sub-character components, alphabetic systems, semantic domains, and numerical concepts reveals systematic geometric patterns and critical limitations in current embedding models. At the sub-character level, purely structural elements (Chinese radicals) exhibit geometric collapse, highlighting model failures to distinguish semantic from structural components. At the character level, different writing systems show distinct geometric signatures. At the word level, content words form clustering-branching patterns across 20 semantic domains in English, Chinese, and German. Arabic numbers organize through spiral trajectories rather than clustering, violating standard distributional semantics assumptions. These findings establish PHATE manifold learning as an essential analytic tool not only for studying geometric structure of meaning in embedding space, but also for validating the effectiveness of embedding models in capturing semantic relationships.

### [83] [Benchmarking Cross-Lingual Semantic Alignment in Multilingual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09732)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new metric, Semantic Affinity (SA), evaluates cross-lingual alignment in multilingual embedding models, revealing explicit translation supervision is key, not model scale or multilingual training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners lack guidance on selecting multilingual embedding models with genuine cross-lingual alignment. Task benchmarks may overlook alignment flaws.

Method: Introduced SA metric (0-1 scale) using cosine distance and PHATE visualization in Semanscope. Benchmarked 13 models across 4 datasets (52 experiments).

Result: Three-tier structure: BERT models with translation supervision lead (SA ~0.70), LLM embeddings plateau (~0.55-0.61), MLM-only models fail (SA <0.50). Oracle Bone primitives show semantic drift.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual alignment requires explicit translation supervision. SA helps practitioners choose effective multilingual embeddings.

Abstract: With hundreds of multilingual embedding models available, practitioners lack clear guidance on which provide genuine cross-lingual semantic alignment versus task performance through language-specific patterns. Task-driven benchmarks (MTEB) may mask fundamental alignment shortcomings. We introduce Semantic Affinity (SA), a bounded (between 0 and 1) metric measuring inter-lingual to intra-lingual spread ratio using cosine distance, combined with PHATE visualization in our Semanscope framework. Benchmarking 13 models across 4 datasets (52 experiments) reveals a three-tier structure: (1) Top BERT models (LaBSE SA = 0.70, USE SA = 0.68, S-BERT SA = 0.68) achieve strong alignment via translation-pair supervision; (2) LLM embeddings plateau at SA between 0.55 and 0.61 regardless of 0.6 B to 8 B scale; (3) MLM-only BERT models (mBERT, XLM-R, SA < 0.50) fail despite more than 100 language training. Training objective, not architecture or scale, determines alignment. Oracle Bone primitives (1200 BCE) expose semantic drift-models learn corpus patterns rather than cognitive primitives. This work provides semantic benchmarking to help practitioners select quality multilingual embeddings from hundreds of available models, showing cross-lingual alignment requires explicit translation supervision, not merely model scale or multilingual data.

*Xin Gao,Xiaoyang Wang,Yun Zhu,Mengzhang Cai,Conghui He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a closed-loop dataset engineering framework, OpenDataArena (ODA), for constructing SFT datasets using value-anchored rankings and multi-dimensional analysis. It introduces ODA-Math-460k and ODA-Mixture datasets, showing superior performance and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFT dataset construction lacks systematic understanding of sample contributions, relying on heuristics. The authors aim to shift to a structured, feedback-driven approach.

Method: ODA leverages value-anchored rankings and multi-dimensional analysis to guide dataset construction. Specific datasets (ODA-Math-460k and ODA-Mixture) are created using difficulty-aware pipelines and Anchor-and-Patch strategies.

Result: ODA-driven datasets achieve SOTA results on benchmarks (AIME, HMMT) and outperform larger baselines in multi-domain tasks, demonstrating improved reasoning and general utility.

Conclusion: The ODA framework validates a data-centric AI approach, where transparent evaluation drives high-quality training data construction.

Abstract: The construction of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) datasets is a critical yet under-theorized stage in the post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs), as prevalent practices often rely on heuristic aggregation without a systematic understanding of how individual samples contribute to model performance. In this report, we propose a paradigm shift from ad-hoc curation to a closed-loop dataset engineering framework using OpenDataArena (ODA), which leverages value-anchored rankings and multi-dimensional analysis to transform value benchmarking into feedback signals guiding dataset construction. We instantiate this methodology through two new datasets: \textbf{ODA-Math-460k}, a specialized mathematics reasoning dataset that utilizes a novel two-stage difficulty-aware pipeline to achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results on benchmarks such as AIME and HMMT, and \textbf{ODA-Mixture (100k \& 500k)}, a series of multi-domain instruction datasets built via an ``Anchor-and-Patch'' strategy that outperforms significantly larger open-source baselines. Our empirical results demonstrate that ODA-driven datasets significantly improve both domain-specific reasoning and general utility while achieving superior data efficiency, validating a transition toward data-centric AI where transparent evaluation serves as the primary engine for engineering high-quality training data.

*Yanyi Liu,Qingwen Yang,Tiezheng Guo,Feiyu Qu,Jun Liu,Yingyou Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes shifting from hallucination detection to diagnosis in LLMs, introducing the Hallucination Diagnosis Task and the HDG pipeline for generating training data. The resulting HDM-4B-RL model outperforms detection models and matches larger general models in diagnosis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder reliable deployment in critical domains. Current detection approaches lack interpretable feedback, limiting practical utility.

Method: Introduces the Hallucination Diagnosis Task and HDG pipeline for generating training data, then trains HDM-4B-RL using GRPO with a comprehensive reward function.

Result: HDM-4B-RL surpasses detection models on HaluEval and matches larger general models in diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: Hallucination diagnosis is feasible and valuable, offering methodology for more trustworthy generative AI systems.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), defined as the generation of content inconsistent with facts or context, represent a core obstacle to their reliable deployment in critical domains. Current research primarily focuses on binary "detection" approaches that, while capable of identifying hallucinations, fail to provide interpretable and actionable feedback for model improvement, thus limiting practical utility. To address this limitation, a new research paradigm is proposed, shifting from "detection" to "diagnosis". The Hallucination Diagnosis Task is introduced, a task which requires models to not only detect hallucinations, but also perform error localization, causal explanation, and content correction. We develop the Hallucination Diagnosis Generator (HDG), an automated pipeline that systematically generates high-quality training samples with rich diagnostic metadata from raw corpora through multi-dimensional augmentation strategies including controlled fact fabrication and reasoning chain perturbation. Using HDG-generated data, we train HDM-4B-RL, a 4-billion-parameter hallucination diagnosis model, employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a comprehensive reward function incorporating structural, accuracy, and localization signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art detection models on the HaluEval benchmark while achieving comparable performance to advanced general-purpose models. In comprehensive diagnosis tasks, HDM-4B-RL matches the capabilities of larger general models while maintaining a smaller size. This work validates the feasibility and value of hallucination diagnosis, providing an effective methodology for building more trustworthy and reliable generative AI systems.

*Xiaoxu Ma,Xiangbo Zhang,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PVNI, an internal-activation-based method, provides stable and explainable personality trait evaluations in LLMs by extracting and interpolating persona vectors, outperforming traditional questionnaire-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional questionnaire-based methods for evaluating personality traits in LLMs lack stability and explainability due to sensitivity to prompt phrasing and role-play variations.

Method: Proposes PVNI, which extracts persona vectors from model activations using contrastive prompts and interpolates neutral scores along these vectors.

Result: PVNI demonstrates significantly more stable evaluations across diverse LLMs compared to existing methods, even under varying conditions.

Conclusion: PVNI offers a robust and interpretable alternative for personality trait assessment in LLMs, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Evaluating personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to model interpretation, comparison, and responsible deployment. However, existing questionnaire-based evaluation methods exhibit limited stability and offer little explainability, as their results are highly sensitive to minor variations in prompt phrasing or role-play configurations. To address these limitations, we propose an internal-activation-based approach, termed Persona-Vector Neutrality Interpolation (PVNI), for stable and explainable personality trait evaluation in LLMs. PVNI extracts a persona vector associated with a target personality trait from the model's internal activations using contrastive prompts. It then estimates the corresponding neutral score by interpolating along the persona vector as an anchor axis, enabling an interpretable comparison between the neutral prompt representation and the persona direction. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness and generalization properties of PVNI. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that PVNI yields substantially more stable personality trait evaluations than existing methods, even under questionnaire and role-play variants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores whether Vision Language Models (VLMs) mirror children's ability to differentiate generic, universally quantified, and indefinite plural statements when extending novel properties, finding behavioral alignment with humans and underlying inductive constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if general-purpose statistical learners like VLMs exhibit similar subtle language-induced constraints in inductive reasoning as observed in children.

Method: Replicated Gelman et al.'s (2002) experiment with VLMs, including precondition tests (category identification and sensitivity to quantifiers) and post-hoc representation analysis.

Result: VLMs showed behavioral alignment with humans, differentiating statement types (all > generics > some) and organizing representations based on inductive constraints.

Conclusion: VLMs encode inductive constraints akin to humans, suggesting shared mechanisms in language-driven reasoning beyond surface forms.

Abstract: Language places subtle constraints on how we make inductive inferences. Developmental evidence by Gelman et al. (2002) has shown children (4 years and older) to differentiate among generic statements ("Bears are daxable"), universally quantified NPs ("all bears are daxable") and indefinite plural NPs ("some bears are daxable") in extending novel properties to a specific member (all > generics > some), suggesting that they represent these types of propositions differently. We test if these subtle differences arise in general purpose statistical learners like Vision Language Models, by replicating the original experiment. On tasking them through a series of precondition tests (robust identification of categories in images and sensitivities to all and some), followed by the original experiment, we find behavioral alignment between models and humans. Post-hoc analyses on their representations revealed that these differences are organized based on inductive constraints and not surface-form differences.

*Sraavya Sambara,Yuan Pu,Ayman Ali,Vishala Mishra,Lionel Wong,Monica Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs handle false premises in real-world health questions, revealing their tendency to provide suboptimal responses instead of redirecting, highlighting safety concerns for medical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in testing LLMs for their ability to redirect health questions with false assumptions, a critical competency for safe medical communication.

Method: A semi-automated pipeline was used to create MedRedFlag, a dataset of 1100+ Reddit-sourced questions requiring redirection. Responses from LLMs and clinicians were systematically compared.

Result: LLMs often failed to redirect problematic questions, even when detecting false premises, leading to potentially suboptimal medical advice.

Conclusion: The study identifies a significant gap in LLM performance for real-world health communication, emphasizing safety risks in patient-facing medical AI.

Abstract: Real-world health questions from patients often unintentionally embed false assumptions or premises. In such cases, safe medical communication typically involves redirection: addressing the implicit misconception and then responding to the underlying patient context, rather than the original question. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used by lay users for medical advice, they have not yet been tested for this crucial competency. Therefore, in this work, we investigate how LLMs react to false premises embedded within real-world health questions. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to curate MedRedFlag, a dataset of 1100+ questions sourced from Reddit that require redirection. We then systematically compare responses from state-of-the-art LLMs to those from clinicians. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often fail to redirect problematic questions, even when the problematic premise is detected, and provide answers that could lead to suboptimal medical decision making. Our benchmark and results reveal a novel and substantial gap in how LLMs perform under the conditions of real-world health communication, highlighting critical safety concerns for patient-facing medical AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models lack global structure, input coverage, and citation consistency in scientific paper generation.

Result: The approach improves structural coherence and citation reliability, outperforming neural and LLM baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations in current models for scientific paper generation, demonstrating significant improvements.

Abstract: Scientific paper generation requires document-level planning and factual grounding, but current large language models, despite their strong local fluency, often fail in global structure, input coverage, and citation consistency. We present a reinforcement learning framework that casts scientific outline construction as a long-horizon planning problem over hierarchical document structures. Our approach models edit evolving outlines through structured actions, enabling the system to incrementally build a complete scientific manuscript. To support effective and stabilize learning,we introduce a two-stage optimization procedure consisting of (i) backward outline reconstruction from partial plans to enforce global structural consistency, and (ii) forward value-guided reinforcement learning with rewards explicitly modeling scientific correctness, discourse coherence, and citation fidelity. In addition, We further introduce a benchmark for scientific paper generation that evaluates document planning, input utilization, reference faithfulness, outline organization, and content-level factual accuracy. Our results show consistent improvements over strong neural and LLM baselines, particularly in long-range structural coherence and citation reliability.

### [90] [Patient-Similarity Cohort Reasoning in Clinical Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09876)
*Yifei Shen,Yilun Zhao,Justice Ou,Tinglin Huang,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLINSQL is a benchmark for clinical text-to-SQL tasks, evaluating models on complex EHR queries. Performance remains below clinical reliability despite recent advances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of real-world clinical text-to-SQL, which involves heterogeneous EHR tables, temporal windows, and patient-similarity cohorts.

Method: Introduces CLINSQL, a benchmark with 633 expert-annotated tasks, evaluating 22 models under Chain-of-Thought self-refinement and rubric-based SQL analysis.

Result: GPT-5-mini achieves 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source models at 69.2%, and Gemini-2.5-Pro drops from 85.5% (Easy) to 67.2% (Hard).

Conclusion: CLINSQL provides tangible progress toward clinically reliable text-to-SQL, though current models still fall short of clinical reliability.

Abstract: Real-world clinical text-to-SQL requires reasoning over heterogeneous EHR tables, temporal windows, and patient-similarity cohorts to produce executable queries. We introduce CLINSQL, a benchmark of 633 expert-annotated tasks on MIMIC-IV v3.1 that demands multi-table joins, clinically meaningful filters, and executable SQL. Solving CLINSQL entails navigating schema metadata and clinical coding systems, handling long contexts, and composing multi-step queries beyond traditional text-to-SQL. We evaluate 22 proprietary and open-source models under Chain-of-Thought self-refinement and use rubric-based SQL analysis with execution checks that prioritize critical clinical requirements. Despite recent advances, performance remains far from clinical reliability: on the test set, GPT-5-mini attains 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source at 69.2% and Gemini-2.5-Pro drops from 85.5% on Easy to 67.2% on Hard. Progress on CLINSQL marks tangible advances toward clinically reliable text-to-SQL for real-world EHR analytics.

### [91] [Clozing the Gap: Exploring Why Language Model Surprisal Outperforms Cloze Surprisal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09886)
*Sathvik Nair,Byung-Doh Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares word predictability using cloze task data and language model (LM) probabilities, finding LM probabilities better predict processing effort. It explores reasons for this advantage, suggesting improvements for cloze studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LM probabilities outperform cloze data in predicting word processing effort and to ensure these predictions lead to correct scientific conclusions about language comprehension.

Method: The study evaluates LM probabilities and cloze data by testing three hypotheses related to resolution, semantic distinction, and low-frequency word handling.

Result: LM probabilities outperform cloze data due to higher resolution, better semantic distinction, and accurate handling of low-frequency words.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need to improve cloze study resolution and investigate whether human prediction mirrors the fine-grained distinctions of LM probabilities.

Abstract: How predictable a word is can be quantified in two ways: using human responses to the cloze task or using probabilities from language models (LMs).When used as predictors of processing effort, LM probabilities outperform probabilities derived from cloze data. However, it is important to establish that LM probabilities do so for the right reasons, since different predictors can lead to different scientific conclusions about the role of prediction in language comprehension. We present evidence for three hypotheses about the advantage of LM probabilities: not suffering from low resolution, distinguishing semantically similar words, and accurately assigning probabilities to low-frequency words. These results call for efforts to improve the resolution of cloze studies, coupled with experiments on whether human-like prediction is also as sensitive to the fine-grained distinctions made by LM probabilities.

*Christabel Acquaye,Yi Ting Huang,Marine Carpuat,Rachel Rudinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs simulate classrooms to predict math question difficulty, showing promising correlations with real-world data, especially with weaker models like Gemma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on costly human pilot studies for assessing math question difficulty by leveraging LLMs.

Method: Simulate classrooms of varying grade levels using LLMs to role-play students, fit IRT models, and compare with NAEP data.

Result: Correlations up to 0.82; named student role-plays and stratified demographics improve accuracy; weaker models outperform mathematically stronger ones.

Conclusion: LLM-based simulations offer a viable, cost-effective alternative for predicting math question difficulty.

Abstract: Standardized math assessments require expensive human pilot studies to establish the difficulty of test items. We investigate the predictive value of open-source large language models (LLMs) for evaluating the difficulty of multiple-choice math questions for real-world students. We show that, while LLMs are poor direct judges of problem difficulty, simulation-based approaches with LLMs yield promising results under the right conditions. Under the proposed approach, we simulate a "classroom" of 4th, 8th, or 12th grade students by prompting the LLM to role-play students of varying proficiency levels. We use the outcomes of these simulations to fit Item Response Theory (IRT) models, comparing learned difficulty parameters for items to their real-world difficulties, as determined by item-level statistics furnished by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). We observe correlations as high as 0.75, 0.76, and 0.82 for grades 4, 8, and 12, respectively. In our simulations, we experiment with different "classroom sizes," showing tradeoffs between computation size and accuracy. We find that role-plays with named students improves predictions (compared to student ids), and stratifying names across gender and race further improves predictions. Our results show that LLMs with relatively weaker mathematical abilities (Gemma) actually yield better real-world difficulty predictions than mathematically stronger models (Llama and Qwen), further underscoring the suitability of open-source models for the task.

*David Samuel Setiawan,Raphaël Merx,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hybrid NMT-LLM framework recovers performance loss in low-resource language translation under domain shift, matching in-domain quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation of NMT models for low-resource languages (e.g., Dhao) under domain shifts, exemplified by drop in chrF++ score from NT to OT.

Method: Combine fine-tuned NMT with LLM-driven refinement using RAG to generate and improve translations.

Result: Final system recovers chrF++ score to 35.21 (from 27.11), driven by retrieved examples, with LLM acting as a 'safety net'.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach effectively mitigates domain shift challenges, emphasizing retrieval quantity over algorithm choice.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for low-resource languages suffer significant performance degradation under domain shift. We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality. Our analysis reveals that this performance is driven primarily by the number of retrieved examples rather than the choice of retrieval algorithm. Qualitative analysis confirms the LLM acts as a robust "safety net," repairing severe failures in zero-shot domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SocraticKG introduces QA pairs as an intermediate step in KG construction to balance factual coverage and relational connectivity, outperforming direct extraction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based KG construction methods face a trade-off between factual coverage and relational fragmentation, leading to information loss or disconnected facts.

Method: Proposes SocraticKG, using 5W1H-guided QA pairs as an intermediate representation to unfold document semantics before triple extraction.

Result: Outperforms direct extraction on the MINE benchmark, achieving better factual retention and structural cohesion as knowledge volume grows.

Conclusion: QA-mediated semantic scaffolding enhances KG construction by structuring semantics beforehand, improving coherence and reliability.

Abstract: Constructing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from unstructured text provides a structured framework for knowledge representation and reasoning, yet current LLM-based approaches struggle with a fundamental trade-off: factual coverage often leads to relational fragmentation, while premature consolidation causes information loss. To address this, we propose SocraticKG, an automated KG construction method that introduces question-answer pairs as a structured intermediate representation to systematically unfold document-level semantics prior to triple extraction. By employing 5W1H-guided QA expansion, SocraticKG captures contextual dependencies and implicit relational links typically lost in direct KG extraction pipelines, providing explicit grounding in the source document that helps mitigate implicit reasoning errors. Evaluation on the MINE benchmark demonstrates that our approach effectively addresses the coverage-connectivity trade-off, achieving superior factual retention while maintaining high structural cohesion even as extracted knowledge volume substantially expands. These results highlight that QA-mediated semantic scaffolding plays a critical role in structuring semantics prior to KG extraction, enabling more coherent and reliable graph construction in subsequent stages.

TL;DR: EHRNavigator is a multi-agent AI framework designed for patient-level question answering in EHRs, showing strong performance (86% accuracy) and adaptability in real-world hospital settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA systems for EHRs are limited by benchmark evaluations, lacking practical relevance for clinical decision-making.

Method: The paper introduces EHRNavigator, a multi-agent framework tested on public and institutional datasets under realistic hospital conditions.

Result: EHRNavigator achieved 86% accuracy in real-world cases with clinically acceptable response times.

Conclusion: EHRNavigator bridges the gap between benchmark evaluations and clinical deployment, offering an efficient solution for EHR question answering.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making increasingly relies on timely and context-aware access to patient information within Electronic Health Records (EHRs), yet most existing natural language question-answering (QA) systems are evaluated solely on benchmark datasets, limiting their practical relevance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EHRNavigator, a multi-agent framework that harnesses AI agents to perform patient-level question answering across heterogeneous and multimodal EHR data. We assessed its performance using both public benchmark and institutional datasets under realistic hospital conditions characterized by diverse schemas, temporal reasoning demands, and multimodal evidence integration. Through quantitative evaluation and clinician-validated chart review, EHRNavigator demonstrated strong generalization, achieving 86% accuracy on real-world cases while maintaining clinically acceptable response times. Overall, these findings confirm that EHRNavigator effectively bridges the gap between benchmark evaluation and clinical deployment, offering a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for real-world EHR question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmplifAI is a Japanese empathetic dialogue dataset for chronic illness patients, featuring 28 emotion categories, 280 situations, and 4125 dialogues. It improves LLM performance in empathy and emotional alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic patients experience shifting emotions, requiring context-aware empathetic dialogue support. EmplifAI fills this gap with validated, fine-grained emotional interactions.

Method: The dataset was crowdsourced and reviewed by experts, adapting GoEmotions taxonomy. Emotional alignment was evaluated using BERTScore on LLMs, and a Japanese LLM was fine-tuned with EmplifAI.

Result: Fine-tuning improved fluency and empathy (F1 score: 0.83). LLM-as-a-Judge and human ratings validated the evaluation pipeline, revealing insights from correlation analysis.

Conclusion: EmplifAI enhances empathetic dialogue generation for chronic patients, demonstrating effectiveness through benchmarking and human-LLM evaluation alignment.

Abstract: This paper introduces EmplifAI, a Japanese empathetic dialogue dataset designed to support patients coping with chronic medical conditions. They often experience a wide range of positive and negative emotions (e.g., hope and despair) that shift across different stages of disease management. EmplifAI addresses this complexity by providing situation-based dialogues grounded in 28 fine-grained emotion categories, adapted and validated from the GoEmotions taxonomy. The dataset includes 280 medically contextualized situations and 4125 two-turn dialogues, collected through crowdsourcing and expert review. To evaluate emotional alignment in empathetic dialogues, we assessed model predictions on situation--dialogue pairs using BERTScore across multiple large language models (LLMs), achieving F1 scores of 0.83. Fine-tuning a baseline Japanese LLM (LLM-jp-3.1-13b-instruct4) with EmplifAI resulted in notable improvements in fluency, general empathy, and emotion-specific empathy. Furthermore, we compared the scores assigned by LLM-as-a-Judge and human raters on dialogues generated by multiple LLMs to validate our evaluation pipeline and discuss the insights and potential risks derived from the correlation analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-ALIGN improves reasoning distillation by adaptively aligning teacher-generated reasoning prefixes for better student learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teacher-generated reasoning trajectories are often too complex for student models, creating a learning gap.

Method: P-ALIGN truncates trajectories adaptively and uses prefixes for supervision.

Result: P-ALIGN outperforms baselines by over 3% on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: P-ALIGN provides effective supervision while avoiding redundancy, enhancing reasoning distillation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in solving complex mathematical problems. Recent studies show that distilling long reasoning trajectories can effectively enhance the reasoning performance of small-scale student models. However, teacher-generated reasoning trajectories are often excessively long and structurally complex, making them difficult for student models to learn. This mismatch leads to a gap between the provided supervision signal and the learning capacity of the student model. To address this challenge, we propose Prefix-ALIGNment distillation (P-ALIGN), a framework that fully exploits teacher CoTs for distillation through adaptive prefix alignment. Specifically, P-ALIGN adaptively truncates teacher-generated reasoning trajectories by determining whether the remaining suffix is concise and sufficient to guide the student model. Then, P-ALIGN leverages the teacher-generated prefix to supervise the student model, encouraging effective prefix alignment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that P-ALIGN outperforms all baselines by over 3%. Further analysis indicates that the prefixes constructed by P-ALIGN provide more effective supervision signals, while avoiding the negative impact of redundant and uncertain reasoning components. All code is available at https://github.com/NEUIR/P-ALIGN.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Codified Decision Trees (CDT), a framework for creating structured, executable, and validated behavioral profiles for role-playing agents, improving reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavioral profiles for role-playing agents are unstructured, non-executable, and weakly validated, resulting in inconsistent and brittle agent behavior.

Method: CDT uses data-driven techniques to learn decision trees from narrative data, representing profiles as hierarchical conditional rules validated and refined iteratively.

Result: CDT outperforms human-written profiles and prior methods on benchmarks involving 85 characters across 16 artifacts.

Conclusion: Structured and validated behavioral profiles, as produced by CDT, enhance agent reliability and grounding in narrative contexts.

Abstract: Role-playing (RP) agents rely on behavioral profiles to act consistently across diverse narrative contexts, yet existing profiles are largely unstructured, non-executable, and weakly validated, leading to brittle agent behavior. We propose Codified Decision Trees (CDT), a data-driven framework that induces an executable and interpretable decision structure from large-scale narrative data. CDT represents behavioral profiles as a tree of conditional rules, where internal nodes correspond to validated scene conditions and leaves encode grounded behavioral statements, enabling deterministic retrieval of context-appropriate rules at execution time. The tree is learned by iteratively inducing candidate scene-action rules, validating them against data, and refining them through hierarchical specialization, yielding profiles that support transparent inspection and principled updates. Across multiple benchmarks, CDT substantially outperforms human-written profiles and prior profile induction methods on $85$ characters across $16$ artifacts, indicating that codified and validated behavioral representations lead to more reliable agent grounding.

TL;DR: Evaluation of four commercial MT systems' readiness for translating low-resource languages in crisis or medical domains using the TICO-19 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess how effective commercial MT systems are in bridging language gaps during crises, especially for low-resource languages.

Method: Evaluated four commercial MT systems using the TICO-19 dataset, focusing on pandemic-related sentences for high-priority languages.

Result: Analysis of translation usability to determine readiness for future pandemics or epidemics.

Conclusion: The study highlights the current capabilities and limitations of commercial MT systems in crisis communication.

Abstract: Communication in times of crisis is essential. However, there is often a mismatch between the language of governments, aid providers, doctors, and those to whom they are providing aid. Commercial MT systems are reasonable tools to turn to in these scenarios. But how effective are these tools for translating to and from low resource languages, particularly in the crisis or medical domain? In this study, we evaluate four commercial MT systems using the TICO-19 dataset, which is composed of pandemic-related sentences from a large set of high priority languages spoken by communities most likely to be affected adversely in the next pandemic. We then assess the current degree of ``readiness'' for another pandemic (or epidemic) based on the usability of the output translations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CALM-IT improves LLMs' ability to sustain realistic, goal-directed therapeutic dialogues by modeling bidirectional conversational dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with maintaining coherent therapeutic progress in long interactions due to local optimization.

Method: CALM-IT introduces a bidirectional state-space process modeling therapist-client dynamics for strategy and utterance generation.

Result: CALM-IT outperforms baselines in Effectiveness, Goal Alignment, and stability, achieving a 64.3% client acceptance rate.

Conclusion: Modeling evolving conversational state is key for high-quality synthetic therapeutic dialogues.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health-related settings, yet they struggle to sustain realistic, goal-directed dialogue over extended interactions. While LLMs generate fluent responses, they optimize locally for the next turn rather than maintaining a coherent model of therapeutic progress, leading to brittleness and long-horizon drift. We introduce CALM-IT, a framework for generating and evaluating long-form Motivational Interviewing (MI) dialogues that explicitly models dual-actor conversational dynamics. CALM-IT represents therapist-client interaction as a bidirectional state-space process, in which both agents continuously update inferred alignment, mental states, and short-term goals to guide strategy selection and utterance generation. Across large-scale evaluations, CALM-IT consistently outperforms strong baselines in Effectiveness and Goal Alignment and remains substantially more stable as conversation length increases. Although CALM-IT initiates fewer therapist redirections, it achieves the highest client acceptance rate (64.3%), indicating more precise and therapeutically aligned intervention timing. Overall, CALM-IT provides evidence for modeling evolving conversational state being essential for generating high-quality long-form synthetic conversations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Fish-in-the-Ocean' (FITO) to evaluate multimodal LLMs' understanding of scientific papers by requiring explicit cross-modal evidence chains. It builds SIN-Data and SIN-Bench for testing and finds grounding evidence as a key challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics fail to assess causal, evidence-linked reasoning in long-form scientific papers, leading to superficial evaluations.

Method: Proposes FITO paradigm, creates SIN-Data (interleaved text-figure corpus) and SIN-Bench (four tasks: SIN-Find, SIN-Verify, SIN-QA, SIN-Summary), and introduces 'No Evidence, No Score' scoring.

Result: Experiments show grounding as the main bottleneck, with Gemini-3-pro leading overall (0.573) and GPT-5 excelling in SIN-QA (0.767) but lacking traceable support.

Conclusion: FITO effectively exposes gaps in multimodal LLMs' evidence-linked reasoning, highlighting grounding as critical for true understanding.

Abstract: Evaluating whether multimodal large language models truly understand long-form scientific papers remains challenging: answer-only metrics and synthetic "Needle-In-A-Haystack" tests often reward answer matching without requiring a causal, evidence-linked reasoning trace in the document. We propose the "Fish-in-the-Ocean" (FITO) paradigm, which requires models to construct explicit cross-modal evidence chains within native scientific documents. To operationalize FITO, we build SIN-Data, a scientific interleaved corpus that preserves the native interleaving of text and figures. On top of it, we construct SIN-Bench with four progressive tasks covering evidence discovery (SIN-Find), hypothesis verification (SIN-Verify), grounded QA (SIN-QA), and evidence-anchored synthesis (SIN-Summary). We further introduce "No Evidence, No Score", scoring predictions when grounded to verifiable anchors and diagnosing evidence quality via matching, relevance, and logic. Experiments on eight MLLMs show that grounding is the primary bottleneck: Gemini-3-pro achieves the best average overall score (0.573), while GPT-5 attains the highest SIN-QA answer accuracy (0.767) but underperforms on evidence-aligned overall scores, exposing a gap between correctness and traceable support.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a skill-centric distillation framework for efficiently transferring reasoning abilities from large models to weaker ones, achieving significant performance gains with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of traditional distillation methods that require large-scale data for supervised fine-tuning, aiming for data-efficient training approaches.

Method: The method involves skill-based data selection and skill-aware fine-tuning, focusing on the student model's weaker skills and explicit skill decomposition during problem-solving.

Result: Using only 1,000 training examples from a 100K corpus, the method outperforms random SFT baselines by +1.6% on Qwen3-4B and +1.4% on Qwen3-8B across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: The skill-centric framework effectively enhances reasoning distillation efficiency, with gains specifically tied to emphasized skills.

Abstract: Large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 and their distilled variants achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, distilling these models often demands large-scale data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), motivating the pursuit of data-efficient training methods. To address this, we propose a skill-centric distillation framework that efficiently transfers reasoning ability to weaker models with two components: (1) Skill-based data selection, which prioritizes examples targeting the student model's weaker skills, and (2) Skill-aware fine-tuning, which encourages explicit skill decomposition during problem solving. With only 1,000 training examples selected from a 100K teacher-generated corpus, our method surpasses random SFT baselines by +1.6% on Qwen3-4B and +1.4% on Qwen3-8B across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Further analysis confirms that these gains concentrate on skills emphasized during training, highlighting the effectiveness of skill-centric training for efficient reasoning distillation.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have emerged as a prominent research focus at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and human-computer interaction. This paper systematically reviews the current development and key technologies of RPLAs, delineating the technological evolution from early rule-based template paradigms, through the language style imitation stage, to the cognitive simulation stage centered on personality modeling and memory mechanisms. It summarizes the critical technical pathways supporting high-quality role-playing, including psychological scale-driven character modeling, memory-augmented prompting mechanisms, and motivation-situation-based behavioral decision control. At the data level, the paper further analyzes the methods and challenges of constructing role-specific corpora, focusing on data sources, copyright constraints, and structured annotation processes. In terms of evaluation, it collates multi-dimensional assessment frameworks and benchmark datasets covering role knowledge, personality fidelity, value alignment, and interactive hallucination, while commenting on the advantages and disadvantages of methods such as human evaluation, reward models, and LLM-based scoring. Finally, the paper outlines future development directions of role-playing agents, including personality evolution modeling, multi-agent collaborative narrative, multimodal immersive interaction, and integration with cognitive neuroscience, aiming to provide a systematic perspective and methodological insights for subsequent research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TS-Bench, TS-Guard, and TS-Flow to enhance the safety of tool invocations in LLM agents, reducing harmful actions and improving task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expanded capabilities of LLM-based agents introduce security risks, and existing solutions lack real-time monitoring and intervention for tool invocation safety.

Method: Developed TS-Bench (a benchmark) and TS-Guard (a guardrail model using multi-task reinforcement learning) to detect unsafe tool invocations. Also introduced TS-Flow, a framework for feedback-driven reasoning.

Result: TS-Guard and TS-Flow reduced harmful tool invocations by 65% and improved benign task completion by 10% under prompt injection attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance the safety and reliability of LLM agents in tool invocations, addressing critical security risks.

Abstract: While LLM-based agents can interact with environments via invoking external tools, their expanded capabilities also amplify security risks. Monitoring step-level tool invocation behaviors in real time and proactively intervening before unsafe execution is critical for agent deployment, yet remains under-explored. In this work, we first construct TS-Bench, a novel benchmark for step-level tool invocation safety detection in LLM agents. We then develop a guardrail model, TS-Guard, using multi-task reinforcement learning. The model proactively detects unsafe tool invocation actions before execution by reasoning over the interaction history. It assesses request harmfulness and action-attack correlations, producing interpretable and generalizable safety judgments and feedback. Furthermore, we introduce TS-Flow, a guardrail-feedback-driven reasoning framework for LLM agents, which reduces harmful tool invocations of ReAct-style agents by 65 percent on average and improves benign task completion by approximately 10 percent under prompt injection attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand functional specialization in MoE models, similar to the human brain, by distinguishing domain and driver experts and analyzing their roles.

Method: Introduces entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to identify domain and driver experts, and examines token associations with expert activation.

Result: Reveals domain preference in some experts, causal influence of driver experts, token-triggering patterns, and performance gains from adjusting expert weights.

Conclusion: The findings enhance interpretability of MoE models and demonstrate practical benefits of understanding expert-level mechanisms.

Abstract: Most interpretability work focuses on layer- or neuron-level mechanisms in Transformers, leaving expert-level behavior in MoE LLMs underexplored. Motivated by functional specialization in the human brain, we analyze expert activation by distinguishing domain and driver experts. In this work, we study expert activation in MoE models across three public domains and address two key questions: (1) which experts are activated, and whether certain expert types exhibit consistent activation patterns; and (2) how tokens are associated with and trigger the activation of specific experts. To answer these questions, we introduce entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to assess whether an expert is strongly favored for a particular domain, and how strongly expert activation contributes causally to the model's output, thus identify domain and driver experts, respectively. Furthermore, we explore how individual tokens are associated with the activation of specific experts. Our analysis reveals that (1) Among the activated experts, some show clear domain preferences, while others exert strong causal influence on model performance, underscoring their decisive roles. (2) tokens occurring earlier in a sentence are more likely to trigger the driver experts, and (3) adjusting the weights of domain and driver experts leads to significant performance gains across all three models and domains. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms of MoE models and enhance their interpretability.

### [106] [Alignment Pretraining: AI Discourse Causes Self-Fulfilling (Mis)alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10160)
*Cameron Tice,Puria Radmard,Samuel Ratnam,Andy Kim,David Africa,Kyle O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how pretraining discourse about AI influences LLM alignment, finding that negative discourse increases misalignment while positive discourse reduces it. Effects persist post-training, suggesting alignment pretraining as a key practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the causal impact of pretraining discourse on AI alignment, addressing gaps in understanding how descriptions of AI behavior affect downstream alignment.

Method: Pretrained 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of alignment and misalignment discourse, including upsampling synthetic training documents to measure behavioral changes.

Result: Negative discourse increased misaligned behavior (e.g., misalignment scores rose), while positive discourse reduced misalignment (from 45% to 9%). Effects persisted post-training.

Conclusion: Pretraining discourse significantly shapes alignment priors, supporting alignment pretraining as a complement to post-training. Practitioners should prioritize alignment pretraining alongside capabilities.

Abstract: Pretraining corpora contain extensive discourse about AI systems, yet the causal influence of this discourse on downstream alignment remains poorly understood. If prevailing descriptions of AI behaviour are predominantly negative, LLMs may internalise corresponding behavioural priors, giving rise to self-fulfilling misalignment. This paper provides the first controlled study of this hypothesis by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse. We find that discussion of AI contributes to misalignment. Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment leads to a notable increase in misaligned behaviour. Conversely, upsampling documents about aligned behaviour reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9%. We consider this evidence of self-fulfilling alignment. These effects are dampened, but persist through post-training. Our findings establish the study of how pretraining data shapes alignment priors, or alignment pretraining, as a complement to post-training. We recommend practitioners pretrain for alignment as well as capabilities. Our models and datasets are available at alignmentpretraining.ai

TL;DR: The paper introduces Credit C-GPT, a specialized Vietnamese language model for debt collection, integrating multiple conversational tasks and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debt collection relies on complex human conversations in informal Vietnamese, challenging traditional NLP systems, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: Developed a 7B-parameter Vietnamese LLM (Credit C-GPT) for debt collection, combining dialogue understanding, sentiment analysis, intent detection, and more in one framework.

Result: The model showed consistent improvements over pipeline-based approaches on proprietary datasets.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized LLMs like Credit C-GPT offer scalable, privacy-aware solutions for real-time and post-call analytics in contact centers.

Abstract: Debt collection is a critical function within the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector, relying heavily on large-scale human-to-human conversational interactions conducted primarily in Vietnamese contact centers. These conversations involve informal spoken language, emotional variability, and complex domain-specific reasoning, which pose significant challenges for traditional natural language processing systems. This paper introduces Credit C-GPT, a domain-specialized large language model with seven billion parameters, fine-tuned for conversational understanding in Vietnamese debt collection scenarios. The proposed model integrates multiple conversational intelligence tasks, including dialogue understanding, sentiment recognition, intent detection, call stage classification, and structured slot-value extraction, within a single reasoning-based framework. We describe the data construction process, annotation strategy, and training methodology, and evaluate the model on proprietary human-annotated datasets. Experimental results show consistent improvements over traditional pipeline-based approaches, indicating that domain-specialized conversational language models provide a scalable and privacy-aware solution for real-time assistance and post-call analytics in enterprise contact centers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sand-Glass benchmark and HOMURA framework to address LLMs' verbosity bias in multilingual translation under strict syllable-level duration constraints, achieving better length control without losing semantic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in multilingual translation but struggle with verbosity bias, making them unfit for time-constrained tasks like subtitling. Current methods fail to balance semantic fidelity and temporal feasibility.

Method: Proposes Sand-Glass benchmark for syllable-level duration evaluation and HOMURA, a reinforcement learning framework with KL-regularized objective and dynamic syllable-ratio reward.

Result: HOMURA outperforms strong LLM baselines, achieving precise length control while preserving semantic adequacy and respecting linguistic density hierarchies.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges the gap between semantic fidelity and temporal compliance in LLM-based translation, offering a practical solution for constrained tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable strides in multilingual translation but are hindered by a systemic cross-lingual verbosity bias, rendering them unsuitable for strict time-constrained tasks like subtitling and dubbing. Current prompt-engineering approaches struggle to resolve this conflict between semantic fidelity and rigid temporal feasibility. To bridge this gap, we first introduce Sand-Glass, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate translation under syllable-level duration constraints. Furthermore, we propose HOMURA, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly optimizes the trade-off between semantic preservation and temporal compliance. By employing a KL-regularized objective with a novel dynamic syllable-ratio reward, HOMURA effectively "tames" the output length. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines, achieving precise length control that respects linguistic density hierarchies without compromising semantic adequacy.

TL;DR: HUMANLLM is a framework modeling psychological patterns as causal forces to enhance human alignment in LLMs, achieving strong accuracy with cognitive modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of aligning LLMs authentically with human cognitive and behavioral patterns for advanced persona simulation.

Method: The method involves constructing 244 psychological patterns from academic papers, synthesizing 11,359 interaction scenarios, and using dual-level checklists for evaluation.

Result: HUMANLLM-8B outperforms Qwen3-32B on multi-pattern dynamics despite fewer parameters, showing high human alignment (r=0.91).

Conclusion: Authentic anthropomorphism in LLMs requires cognitive modeling of underlying psychological processes, not just behavioral simulation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and generation, serving as the foundation for advanced persona simulation and Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs). However, achieving authentic alignment with human cognitive and behavioral patterns remains a critical challenge for these agents. We present HUMANLLM, a framework treating psychological patterns as interacting causal forces. We construct 244 patterns from ~12,000 academic papers and synthesize 11,359 scenarios where 2-5 patterns reinforce, conflict, or modulate each other, with multi-turn conversations expressing inner thoughts, actions, and dialogue. Our dual-level checklists evaluate both individual pattern fidelity and emergent multi-pattern dynamics, achieving strong human alignment (r=0.91) while revealing that holistic metrics conflate simulation accuracy with social desirability. HUMANLLM-8B outperforms Qwen3-32B on multi-pattern dynamics despite 4x fewer parameters, demonstrating that authentic anthropomorphism requires cognitive modeling--simulating not just what humans do, but the psychological processes generating those behaviors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating multilingual embedding models in aligning culturally grounded preferences across 12 Indian languages, focusing on retrieval and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks assessing persona-instruction compatibility in multilingual contexts, especially for India's diverse linguistic population.

Method: A unified benchmark with four tasks: monolingual/cross-lingual retrieval, reverse retrieval, and compatibility classification, evaluated using eight multilingual models in a frozen-encoder setup.

Result: E5-Large-Instruct excels in retrieval tasks, BGE-M3 leads reverse retrieval, and LaBSE performs best in classification with strong calibration.

Conclusion: The work provides practical insights for model selection in multilingual retrieval and sets reproducible baselines.

Abstract: Aligning multilingual assistants with culturally grounded user preferences is essential for serving India's linguistically diverse population of over one billion speakers across multiple scripts. However, existing benchmarks either focus on a single language or conflate retrieval with generation, leaving open the question of whether current embedding models can encode persona-instruction compatibility without relying on response synthesis. We present a unified benchmark spanning 12 Indian languages and four evaluation tasks: monolingual and cross-lingual persona-to-instruction retrieval, reverse retrieval from instruction to persona, and binary compatibility classification. Eight multilingual embedding models are evaluated in a frozen-encoder setting with a thin logistic regression head for classification. E5-Large-Instruct achieves the highest Recall@1 of 27.4\% on monolingual retrieval and 20.7\% on cross-lingual transfer, while BGE-M3 leads reverse retrieval at 32.1\% Recall@1. For classification, LaBSE attains 75.3\% AUROC with strong calibration. These findings offer practical guidance for model selection in Indic multilingual retrieval and establish reproducible baselines for future work\footnote{Code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/aryashah2k/PI-Indic-Align.

TL;DR: LTs reduce the gap between internal knowledge and outputs but degrade knowledge quality; introspection remains limited to final loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between LLMs' internal knowledge and explicit outputs using Looped Transformers.

Method: Empirical investigation of LT architectures, testing how loop iterations affect knowledge and introspection.

Result: More iterations narrow the gap but degrade knowledge; introspection only occurs in the final loop.

Conclusion: LTs show potential for computational depth but lack effective introspection to connect representation and language.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit a gap between their internal knowledge and their explicit linguistic outputs. In this report, we empirically investigate whether Looped Transformers (LTs)--architectures that increase computational depth by iterating shared layers--can bridge this gap by utilizing their iterative nature as a form of introspection. Our experiments reveal that while increasing loop iterations narrows the gap, it is partly driven by a degradation of their internal knowledge carried by representations. Moreover, another empirical analysis suggests that current LTs' ability to perceive representations does not improve across loops; it is only present in the final loop. These results suggest that while LTs offer a promising direction for scaling computational depth, they have yet to achieve the introspection required to truly link representation space and natural language.

Conclusion: Small models like coTherapist can emulate expert behavior, offering scalable solutions for digital mental health tools.

Abstract: Access to mental healthcare is increasingly strained by workforce shortages and rising demand, motivating the development of intelligent systems that can support mental healthcare experts. We introduce coTherapist, a unified framework utilizing a small language model to emulate core therapeutic competencies through domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, and agentic reasoning. Evaluation on clinical queries demonstrates that coTherapist generates more relevant and clinically grounded responses than contemporary baselines. Using our novel T-BARS rubric and psychometric profiling, we confirm coTherapist exhibits high empathy and therapist-consistent personality traits. Furthermore, human evaluation by domain experts validates that coTherapist delivers accurate, trustworthy, and safe responses. coTherapist was deployed and tested by clinical experts. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that small models can be engineered to exhibit expert-like behavior, offering a scalable pathway for digital mental health tools.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs produce different moral judgments across languages and develops a method to isolate the effects of dilemma language and reasoning language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and why LLMs judge moral dilemmas differently in different languages, disentangling the impact of dilemma language versus reasoning language.

Method: Introduces a methodology manipulating dilemma and reasoning languages separately, including mismatched conditions, and interprets judgments using Moral Foundations Theory.

Result: Findings show reasoning-language effects contribute twice the variance of input-language effects, detect context-dependency in nearly half of models, and propose a diagnostic taxonomy.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively isolates language effects, provides insights into model behavior, and offers deployment guidance, with released datasets and code.

Abstract: When LLMs judge moral dilemmas, do they reach different conclusions in different languages, and if so, why? Two factors could drive such differences: the language of the dilemma itself, or the language in which the model reasons. Standard evaluation conflates these by testing only matched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with English reasoning). We introduce a methodology that separately manipulates each factor, covering also mismatched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with Chinese reasoning), enabling decomposition of their contributions. To study \emph{what} changes, we propose an approach to interpret the moral judgments in terms of Moral Foundations Theory. As a side result, we identify evidence for splitting the Authority dimension into a family-related and an institutional dimension. Applying this methodology to English-Chinese moral judgment with 13 LLMs, we demonstrate its diagnostic power: (1) the framework isolates reasoning-language effects as contributing twice the variance of input-language effects; (2) it detects context-dependency in nearly half of models that standard evaluation misses; and (3) a diagnostic taxonomy translates these patterns into deployment guidance. We release our code and datasets at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CrossCulturalMoralJudgement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Projection Kernel (PK) to better measure attention-head relationships in Transformers, outperforming prior metrics like the Composition Score. It also provides a framework to assess PK distributions and identifies a hub head in GPT2-small.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for understanding attention-head relationships in Transformers are inadequate. The study aims to develop a better measure (PK) and analyze its effectiveness.

Method: The Projection Kernel (PK) is used to quantify head-to-head relationships based on subspace similarity. A framework evaluates PK distributions against random orthogonal subspaces, and a directed graph analyzes head interactions.

Result: PK captures known head-to-head interactions more clearly than prior metrics. In GPT2-small, L4H7 is identified as a hub head functioning as an identity head.

Conclusion: PK is a robust metric for analyzing attention-head relationships, offering clearer insights into Transformer structure and identifying functional hubs like L4H7.

Abstract: Understanding relationships between attention heads is essential for interpreting the internal structure of Transformers, yet existing metrics do not capture this structure well. We focus on the subspaces spanned by attention-head weight matrices and quantify head-to-head relationships using the Projection Kernel (PK), a principal-angle-based measure of subspace similarity. Experiments show that PK reproduces known head-to-head interactions on the IOI task more clearly than prior metrics such as the Composition Score. We further introduce a framework to quantify the informativeness of PK distributions by comparing them with a reference distribution derived from random orthogonal subspaces. As an application, we analyze a directed graph constructed from PK and show that, in GPT2-small, L4H7 acts as a hub by functioning as an identity head.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of current multimodal models that ignore modality differences by proposing specialized routing pathways.

Method: Introduces MAMoE with modality-specific experts and shared experts, trained on ASR/TTS datasets and fine-tuned with speech-text instructions.

Result: Outperforms comparable models in ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: MoST is the first open-source speech-text LLM using Mixture of Experts, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: We present MoST (Mixture of Speech and Text), a novel multimodal large language model that seamlessly integrates speech and text processing through our proposed Modality-Aware Mixture of Experts (MAMoE) architecture. While current multimodal models typically process diverse modality representations with identical parameters, disregarding their inherent representational differences, we introduce specialized routing pathways that direct tokens to modality-appropriate experts based on input type. MAMoE simultaneously enhances modality-specific learning and cross-modal understanding through two complementary components: modality-specific expert groups that capture domain-specific patterns and shared experts that facilitate information transfer between modalities. Building on this architecture, we develop an efficient transformation pipeline that adapts the pretrained MoE language model through strategic post-training on ASR and TTS datasets, followed by fine-tuning with a carefully curated speech-text instruction dataset. A key feature of this pipeline is that it relies exclusively on fully accessible, open-source datasets to achieve strong performance and data efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks show that MoST consistently outperforms existing models of comparable parameter counts. Our ablation studies confirm that the modality-specific routing mechanism and shared experts design significantly contribute to performance gains across all tested domains. To our knowledge, MoST represents the first fully open-source speech-text LLM built on a Mixture of Experts architecture. \footnote{We release MoST model, training code, inference code, and training data at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/MoST

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptive Moral Fusion (AMF) to enhance LLM moral alignment using Moral Foundations Theory, validated across languages and behavioral levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM moral alignment methods are superficial; this work aims to intrinsically align LLMs by mapping and manipulating their moral representations.

Method: Uses Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), cross-lingual linear probing, and Moral Vectors to develop AMF, an inference-time intervention.

Result: AMF reduces incorrect refusals on benign queries and lowers jailbreak success rates compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses intrinsic moral alignment in LLMs, balancing safety and helpfulness.

Abstract: Enhancing the moral alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in AI safety. Current alignment techniques often act as superficial guardrails, leaving the intrinsic moral representations of LLMs largely untouched. In this paper, we bridge this gap by leveraging Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to map and manipulate the fine-grained moral landscape of LLMs. Through cross-lingual linear probing, we validate the shared nature of moral representations in middle layers and uncover a shared yet different moral subspace between English and Chinese. Building upon this, we extract steerable Moral Vectors and successfully validate their efficacy at both internal and behavioral levels. Leveraging the high generalizability of morality, we propose Adaptive Moral Fusion (AMF), a dynamic inference-time intervention that synergizes probe detection with vector injection to tackle the safety-helpfulness trade-off. Empirical results confirm that our approach acts as a targeted intrinsic defense, effectively reducing incorrect refusals on benign queries while minimizing jailbreak success rates compared to standard baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve multilingual alignment by focusing on sense adaptation rather than shared parameters, addressing limitations in existing methods.

Method: SENSIA adapts a Backpack language model by aligning sense-level mixtures and contextual representations on parallel data, combined with target-language language modeling loss for fluency.

Result: SENSIA outperforms comparable multilingual methods and matches monolingual baselines with 2-4x less target-language data, preserving sense geometry and robustness.

Conclusion: SENSIA provides an effective sense-based approach for multilingual adaptation, maintaining accuracy and structural alignment while reducing data dependency.

Abstract: We approach multilinguality as sense adaptation: aligning latent meaning representations across languages rather than relying solely on shared parameters and scale. In this paper, we introduce SENse-based Symmetric Interlingual Alignment (SENSIA), which adapts a Backpack language model from one language to another by explicitly aligning sense-level mixtures and contextual representations on parallel data, while jointly training a target-language language modeling loss to preserve fluency. Across benchmarks on four typologically diverse languages, SENSIA generally outperforms comparable multilingual alignment methods and achieves competitive accuracy against monolingual from-scratch baselines while using 2-4x less target-language data. Analyses of learned sense geometry indicate that local sense topology and global structure relative to English are largely preserved, and ablations show that the method is robust in terms of design and scale.

Motivation: To improve reliability and boundary awareness in NL2SQL systems by embedding these features directly into the generation process and addressing ambiguity and schema limitations.

Method: A two-stage training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization, with Task-Conditioned Hybrid Reward for optimization.

Result: BAR-SQL achieves 91.48% average accuracy, outperforming leading proprietary models like Claude 4.5 Sonnet and GPT-5 in SQL generation and abstention.

Conclusion: BAR-SQL sets a new standard for reliable and boundary-aware NL2SQL systems, with publicly available source code and benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BAR-SQL (Boundary-Aware Reliable NL2SQL), a unified training framework that embeds reliability and boundary awareness directly into the generation process. We introduce a Seed Mutation data synthesis paradigm that constructs a representative enterprise corpus, explicitly encompassing multi-step analytical queries alongside boundary cases including ambiguity and schema limitations. To ensure interpretability, we employ Knowledge-Grounded Reasoning Synthesis, which produces Chain-of-Thought traces explicitly anchored in schema metadata and business rules. The model is trained through a two-stage process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. We design a Task-Conditioned Hybrid Reward mechanism that simultaneously optimizes SQL execution accuracy-leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree analysis and dense result matching-and semantic precision in abstention responses. To evaluate reliability alongside generation accuracy, we construct and release Ent-SQL-Bench, which jointly assesse SQL precision and boundary-aware abstention across ambiguous and unanswerable queries. Experimental results on this benchmark demonstrate that BAR-SQL achieves 91.48% average accuracy, outperforming leading proprietary models, including Claude 4.5 Sonnet and GPT-5, in both SQL generation quality and boundary-aware abstention capability.

TL;DR: A re-ranking model using late cross-attention and LLM-generated supervision improves multilingual, long-context job-resume matching efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of real-time, multilingual, and long-context job-resume matching with minimal computational overhead.

Method: Proposes a late cross-attention architecture decomposing resumes and briefs, uses generative LLM for supervision, and distills signal via enriched loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in relevance, ranking, and calibration metrics.

Conclusion: The model achieves efficient, interpretable person-job matching with reduced bias.

Abstract: Finding the most relevant person for a job proposal in real time is challenging, especially when resumes are long, structured, and multilingual. In this paper, we propose a re-ranking model based on a new generation of late cross-attention architecture, that decomposes both resumes and project briefs to efficiently handle long-context inputs with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate historical data biases, we use a generative large language model (LLM) as a teacher, generating fine-grained, semantically grounded supervision. This signal is distilled into our student model via an enriched distillation loss function. The resulting model produces skill-fit scores that enable consistent and interpretable person-job matching. Experiments on relevance, ranking, and calibration metrics demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: OctoBench is released to support reproducible benchmarking and advance scaffold-aware coding agent development.

Abstract: Modern coding scaffolds turn LLMs into capable software agents, but their ability to follow scaffold-specified instructions remains under-examined, especially when constraints are heterogeneous and persist across interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce OctoBench, which benchmarks scaffold-aware instruction following in repository-grounded agentic coding. OctoBench includes 34 environments and 217 tasks instantiated under three scaffold types, and is paired with 7,098 objective checklist items. To disentangle solving the task from following the rules, we provide an automated observation-and-scoring toolkit that captures full trajectories and performs fine-grained checks. Experiments on eight representative models reveal a systematic gap between task-solving and scaffold-aware compliance, underscoring the need for training and evaluation that explicitly targets heterogeneous instruction following. We release the benchmark to support reproducible benchmarking and to accelerate the development of more scaffold-aware coding agents.

TL;DR: Efficient distillation struggles when students have strong reasoning ability, causing performance bottlenecks. Token-level analysis reveals suppressed confidence in some tokens. Proposed T3S method improves performance by clearing optimization paths for these tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of continual distillation in frontier regimes where students already possess strong reasoning capabilities, leading to performance bottlenecks and limited gains.

Method: Introduces Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct training objectives at the token level, focusing on clearing optimization paths for suppressed tokens.

Result: Demonstrates consistent gains: Qwen3-8B outperforms DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds baseline performance, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: T3S effectively resolves token-level optimization issues in continual distillation, yielding significant performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM, a data synthesis pipeline leveraging text corpora for multi-turn tool-use tasks, improving performance and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data for LLMs motivates the development of a scalable, text-based solution.

Method: GEM uses a four-stage process (relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, complexity refinement) and trains a Trajectory Synthesizer for efficiency.

Result: GEM-32B improves performance by 16.5% on BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark and matches quality while reducing latency and costs.

Conclusion: The text-based synthesis paradigm offers superior generalization and efficiency for multi-turn tool-use tasks.

Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively utilize tools in multi-turn interactions is essential for building capable autonomous agents. However, acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-based paradigm. We observe that textual corpora naturally contain rich, multi-step problem-solving experiences, which can serve as an untapped, scalable, and authentic data source for multi-turn tool-use tasks. Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on τ - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm. Notably, our Trajectory Synthesizer matches the quality of the full pipeline while significantly reducing inference latency and costs.

### [125] [The Assistant Axis: Situating and Stabilizing the Default Persona of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10387)
*Christina Lu,Jack Gallagher,Jonathan Michala,Kyle Fish,Jack Lindsey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models default to a 'helpful Assistant' persona and identifies an 'Assistant Axis' that influences behavior. Steering along this axis affects model responses, and extreme deviations can cause 'persona drift,' leading to harmful or bizarre outputs. Stabilizing activations along the axis can improve model consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the structure of model personas, how they can be controlled, and the causes of 'persona drift' to improve model reliability and safety.

Method: The researchers extract activation directions corresponding to different character archetypes, analyze the 'Assistant Axis,' and study its effects on model behavior, including drift and stabilization techniques.

Result: They find the 'Assistant Axis' strongly influences model responses, with extreme deviations causing theatrical or harmful outputs. Stabilizing activations along this axis can prevent drift and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Post-training loosely anchors models to a persona, suggesting the need for better training and steering methods to ensure consistent and safe model behavior.

Abstract: Large language models can represent a variety of personas but typically default to a helpful Assistant identity cultivated during post-training. We investigate the structure of the space of model personas by extracting activation directions corresponding to diverse character archetypes. Across several different models, we find that the leading component of this persona space is an "Assistant Axis," which captures the extent to which a model is operating in its default Assistant mode. Steering towards the Assistant direction reinforces helpful and harmless behavior; steering away increases the model's tendency to identify as other entities. Moreover, steering away with more extreme values often induces a mystical, theatrical speaking style. We find this axis is also present in pre-trained models, where it primarily promotes helpful human archetypes like consultants and coaches and inhibits spiritual ones. Measuring deviations along the Assistant Axis predicts "persona drift," a phenomenon where models slip into exhibiting harmful or bizarre behaviors that are uncharacteristic of their typical persona. We find that persona drift is often driven by conversations demanding meta-reflection on the model's processes or featuring emotionally vulnerable users. We show that restricting activations to a fixed region along the Assistant Axis can stabilize model behavior in these scenarios -- and also in the face of adversarial persona-based jailbreaks. Our results suggest that post-training steers models toward a particular region of persona space but only loosely tethers them to it, motivating work on training and steering strategies that more deeply anchor models to a coherent persona.

*Tarun Sharma,Manikandan Ravikiran,Sourava Kumar Behera,Pramit Bhattacharya,Arnab Bhattacharya,Rohit Saluja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces INDIC-DIALECT, a parallel corpus for Hindi and Odia dialects, addressing their underrepresentation in NLP. It benchmarks tasks like dialect classification and translation, showing improved results with fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of Hindi and Odia dialects in NLP, which are significant in India but lack web presence and datasets.

Method: A human-curated parallel corpus (INDIC-DIALECT) with 13k sentences across 11 dialects and 2 languages is used to benchmark tasks: dialect classification, MCQ answering, and MT. Fine-tuned transformer models and hybrid AI approaches are tested.

Result: Fine-tuned models improved dialect classification F1 from 19.6% to 89.8%. Hybrid AI achieved BLEU scores of 61.32 (dialect to language) and 48.44 (language to dialect), outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: INDIC-DIALECT serves as a valuable benchmark for Indic dialect NLP. Its open-source release aims to foster further research on low-resource dialects.

Abstract: Recent NLP advances focus primarily on standardized languages, leaving most low-resource dialects under-served especially in Indian scenarios. In India, the issue is particularly important: despite Hindi being the third most spoken language globally (over 600 million speakers), its numerous dialects remain underrepresented. The situation is similar for Odia, which has around 45 million speakers. While some datasets exist which contain standard Hindi and Odia languages, their regional dialects have almost no web presence. We introduce INDIC-DIALECT, a human-curated parallel corpus of 13k sentence pairs spanning 11 dialects and 2 languages: Hindi and Odia. Using this corpus, we construct a multi-task benchmark with three tasks: dialect classification, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and machine translation (MT). Our experiments show that LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 perform poorly on the classification task. While fine-tuned transformer based models pretrained on Indian languages substantially improve performance e.g., improving F1 from 19.6\% to 89.8\% on dialect classification. For dialect to language translation, we find that hybrid AI model achieves highest BLEU score of 61.32 compared to the baseline score of 23.36. Interestingly, due to complexity in generating dialect sentences, we observe that for language to dialect translation the ``rule-based followed by AI" approach achieves best BLEU score of 48.44 compared to the baseline score of 27.59. INDIC-DIALECT thus is a new benchmark for dialect-aware Indic NLP, and we plan to release it as open source to support further work on low-resource Indian dialects.

*Mihai Dan Nadas,Laura Diosan,Andreea Tomescu,Andrei Piscoran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TF3-RO introduces an end-to-end pipeline for training compact Romanian language models and generating synthetic fables, addressing gaps in tokenizer design, pretraining, and evaluation for under-resourced languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pipelines lack comprehensive solutions for morphologically rich languages like Romanian, especially regarding reproducibility and linguistic coherence.

Method: The pipeline includes Romanian-specific tokenizer training, pretraining a Transformer model, compression via quantization and distillation, and synthetic data generation using combinatorial prompting.

Result: A 26.45M-parameter distilled model was developed, and three million synthetic Romanian fables were generated, validated by intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: TF3-RO offers a reproducible, linguistically grounded framework for compact language models and synthetic data generation in Romanian.

Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic data generation have shown that compact language models can be trained effectively when the underlying corpus is structurally controlled and linguistically coherent. However, for morphologically rich and computationally under-resourced languages such as Romanian, there is still no openly documented, end-to-end pipeline that unifies tokenizer design, preprocessing, pretraining, compression, evaluation, and large-scale synthetic data generation in a reproducible framework. Building on TF1, a three-million-story English fable dataset, and TF2, which extends TF1 through high-quality Romanian translations, we introduce TF3-RO, a Romanian-centric language modeling pipeline spanning tokenizer training, from-scratch model development, and Romanian-native dataset generation. TF3-RO constructs Romanian-specific BPE and Unigram tokenizers from a linguistically informed corpus to mitigate token inflation induced by Romanian morphology. Using long-sequence packed training, we pretrain a 51.65M-parameter LLaMA-style Transformer entirely from scratch. The model is subsequently optimized through quantization, structured pruning, and logit-based knowledge distillation, yielding a compact 26.45M-parameter student model with tied embeddings and strong deployment characteristics. Using this distilled model, TF3-RO generates three million Romanian-native synthetic fables via a controlled combinatorial prompting framework. Across all stages, the pipeline integrates a comprehensive evaluation suite combining intrinsic metrics, Romanian agreement probes, entity coherence, rule-based grammar checking, and LLM-based assessment. TF3-RO provides a reproducible and linguistically grounded framework for training compact Romanian language models and producing large-scale synthetic narrative corpora.

### [128] [Are Language Models Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10421)
*Philip Resnik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the claim that language models (LMs) serve as cognitive models, arguing they are better seen as tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the overstated role of LMs as cognitive models and address potential hype around large language models (LLMs).

Method: Assessment of LMs at Marr's three levels of analysis (implementation, algorithmic-representational, and computational theory).

Result: LMs fail as cognitive models at the implementation level, are poorly motivated at the algorithmic-representational level, and raise issues at the computational theory level.

Conclusion: LMs are better viewed as tools rather than cognitive models to avoid overstating their capabilities and fueling hype.

Abstract: Futrell and Mahowald claim LMs "serve as model systems", but an assessment at each of Marr's three levels suggests the claim is clearly not true at the implementation level, poorly motivated at the algorithmic-representational level, and problematic at the computational theory level. LMs are good candidates as tools; calling them cognitive models overstates the case and unnecessarily feeds LLM hype.

*Ruochen Li,Kun Yuan,Yufei Xia,Yue Zhou,Qingyu Lu,Weihang Li,Youxiang Zhu,Nassir Navab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques current evaluation protocols for vision-language models (VLMs) in surgical planning, proposing a rule-based benchmark to assess correctness via phase-goal satisfiability. It highlights flaws in similarity metrics and reveals failures in VLMs due to perception and reasoning constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of current evaluation protocols for VLMs in safety-critical surgical planning, the authors aim to define a robust metric grounded in expert-defined rules.

Method: They introduce a multicentric meta-evaluation benchmark with valid procedural variations and invalid plans, using a rule-based goal-satisfiability metric to assess VLMs under constrained settings.

Result: Sequence similarity metrics are shown to misjudge planning quality, while rule-based metrics reveal VLM failures due to perception errors and reasoning constraints. Structural knowledge enhances performance, whereas semantic guidance alone is unreliable.

Conclusion: A rule-based approach reliably evaluates VLMs in surgical planning, exposing weaknesses in current methods and emphasizing the need for structural constraints.

Abstract: Surgical planning integrates visual perception, long-horizon reasoning, and procedural knowledge, yet it remains unclear whether current evaluation protocols reliably assess vision-language models (VLMs) in safety-critical settings. Motivated by a goal-oriented view of surgical planning, we define planning correctness via phase-goal satisfiability, where plan validity is determined by expert-defined surgical rules. Based on this definition, we introduce a multicentric meta-evaluation benchmark with valid procedural variations and invalid plans containing order and content errors. Using this benchmark, we show that sequence similarity metrics systematically misjudge planning quality, penalizing valid plans while failing to identify invalid ones. We therefore adopt a rule-based goal-satisfiability metric as a high-precision meta-evaluation reference to assess Video-LLMs under progressively constrained settings, revealing failures due to perception errors and under-constrained reasoning. Structural knowledge consistently improves performance, whereas semantic guidance alone is unreliable and benefits larger models only when combined with structural constraints.

*Abhinaba Basu,Pavan Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights how bias in AI models varies with contextual framing and introduces Contextual StereoSet, a benchmark to measure this. It proposes Context Sensitivity Fingerprints (CSF) for robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to capture how bias shifts with context, leading to potential misgeneralization of bias scores.

Method: The authors introduce Contextual StereoSet, which varies contextual framing while keeping stereotype content fixed. They test 13 models and propose CSF for evaluation.

Result: Bias scores shift significantly with contextual changes (e.g., time, framing, audience). CSF provides a compact profile for robust bias assessment.

Conclusion: Fixed-condition bias tests may not generalize; CSF reframes evaluation to focus on contextual robustness. The benchmark and tools are released for wider use.

Abstract: A model that avoids stereotypes in a lab benchmark may not avoid them in deployment. We show that measured bias shifts dramatically when prompts mention different places, times, or audiences -- no adversarial prompting required.
  We introduce Contextual StereoSet, a benchmark that holds stereotype content fixed while systematically varying contextual framing. Testing 13 models across two protocols, we find striking patterns: anchoring to 1990 (vs. 2030) raises stereotype selection in all models tested on this contrast (p<0.05); gossip framing raises it in 5 of 6 full-grid models; out-group observer framing shifts it by up to 13 percentage points. These effects replicate in hiring, lending, and help-seeking vignettes.
  We propose Context Sensitivity Fingerprints (CSF): a compact profile of per-dimension dispersion and paired contrasts with bootstrap CIs and FDR correction. Two evaluation tracks support different use cases -- a 360-context diagnostic grid for deep analysis and a budgeted protocol covering 4,229 items for production screening.
  The implication is methodological: bias scores from fixed-condition tests may not generalize.This is not a claim about ground-truth bias rates; it is a stress test of evaluation robustness. CSF forces evaluators to ask, "Under what conditions does bias appear?" rather than "Is this model biased?" We release our benchmark, code, and results.

*Yiwen Gao,Ruochen Zhao,Yang Deng,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DR-Arena is an automated evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as Deep Research Agents, addressing limitations of static benchmarks by using dynamic investigation and adaptive task complexity to reliably assess capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLMs rely on static datasets, which lack task generality, temporal alignment, and are prone to data contamination. DR-Arena aims to overcome these issues by automating evaluation with real-time, dynamic tasks.

Method: DR-Arena constructs real-time Information Trees from web trends, uses an automated Examiner to create tasks testing deep reasoning and wide coverage, and employs an Adaptive Evolvement Loop to dynamically adjust task complexity based on performance.

Result: Experiments show DR-Arena achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.94 with the LMSYS Search Arena leaderboard, aligning well with human preferences without manual intervention.

Conclusion: DR-Arena provides a reliable, automated alternative to costly human adjudication for evaluating LLMs, offering state-of-the-art alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as Deep Research (DR) Agents capable of autonomous investigation and information synthesis, reliable evaluation of their task performance has become a critical bottleneck. Current benchmarks predominantly rely on static datasets, which suffer from several limitations: limited task generality, temporal misalignment, and data contamination. To address these, we introduce DR-Arena, a fully automated evaluation framework that pushes DR agents to their capability limits through dynamic investigation. DR-Arena constructs real-time Information Trees from fresh web trends to ensure the evaluation rubric is synchronized with the live world state, and employs an automated Examiner to generate structured tasks testing two orthogonal capabilities: Deep reasoning and Wide coverage. DR-Arena further adopts Adaptive Evolvement Loop, a state-machine controller that dynamically escalates task complexity based on real-time performance, demanding deeper deduction or wider aggregation until a decisive capability boundary emerges. Experiments with six advanced DR agents demonstrate that DR-Arena achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.94 with the LMSYS Search Arena leaderboard. This represents the state-of-the-art alignment with human preferences without any manual efforts, validating DR-Arena as a reliable alternative for costly human adjudication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AEQ-Bench evaluates OLMs' empathetic response generation and judgment using audio-text inputs, revealing audio-trained models outperform text-only ones but lack fine-grained paralinguistic assessment reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing empathy in OLMs is challenging due to its affectivity, necessitating a systematic benchmark like AEQ-Bench.

Method: Introduces AEQ-Bench with two novel settings (context specificity, speech tone) to evaluate empathetic capabilities via multi-modal inputs.

Result: Audio-trained OLMs outperform text-only models; they align with human judgments on coarse-grained but not fine-grained assessments.

Conclusion: AEQ-Bench highlights OLMs' strengths and gaps in empathetic evaluation, emphasizing the need for improved fine-grained paralinguistic analysis.

Abstract: While the automatic evaluation of omni-modal large models (OLMs) is essential, assessing empathy remains a significant challenge due to its inherent affectivity. To investigate this challenge, we introduce AEQ-Bench (Audio Empathy Quotient Benchmark), a novel benchmark to systematically assess two core empathetic capabilities of OLMs: (i) generating empathetic responses by comprehending affective cues from multi-modal inputs (audio + text), and (ii) judging the empathy of audio responses without relying on text transcription. Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERM enhances LLM empathy by evaluating it bidirectionally (supporter and seeker perspectives) and adding a bystander perspective, outperforming baselines by 10% and achieving 70% user preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based empathy reward models overlook bidirectional empathy interactions, as defined by Empathy Cycle theory.

Method: PERM evaluates empathy bidirectionally (supporter resonation/expression, seeker reception) and includes a bystander perspective for interaction quality.

Result: PERM outperforms baselines by 10% on benchmarks and achieves 70% user preference in blinded studies.

Conclusion: PERM effectively improves LLM empathy by addressing bidirectional interaction gaps, validated by benchmarks and user studies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in human-centric applications, yet they often fail to provide substantive emotional support. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been utilized to enhance empathy of LLMs, existing reward models typically evaluate empathy from a single perspective, overlooking the inherently bidirectional interaction nature of empathy between the supporter and seeker as defined by Empathy Cycle theory. To address this limitation, we propose Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling (PERM). PERM operationalizes empathy evaluation through a bidirectional decomposition: 1) Supporter perspective, assessing internal resonation and communicative expression; 2) Seeker perspective, evaluating emotional reception. Additionally, it incorporates a bystander perspective to monitor overall interaction quality. Extensive experiments on a widely-used emotional intelligence benchmark and an industrial daily conversation dataset demonstrate that PERM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\%. Furthermore, a blinded user study reveals a 70\% preference for our approach, highlighting its efficacy in generating more empathetic responses. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/ZhengWwwq/PERM.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a method for selective knowledge erasure in LLMs, distinguishing true knowledge removal from behavioral suppression by targeting internal activation signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ensuring GDPR compliance and model safety by achieving genuine knowledge erasure, not just surface-level refusal.

Method: KIF combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full retraining.

Result: KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ ~0.99 vs. 1.00) while maintaining utility (MU = 0.62), overcoming the stability-erasure tradeoff.

Conclusion: The framework effectively erases knowledge across model families and scales, with standard models showing scale-independent erasure and reasoning-prior models revealing architectural differences.

Abstract: Selective knowledge erasure from LLMs is critical for GDPR compliance and model safety, yet current unlearning methods conflate behavioral suppression with true knowledge removal, allowing latent capabilities to persist beneath surface-level refusals. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (<3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence. Our comprehensive dual-metric evaluation protocol, combining surface-level leakage with latent trace persistence, operationalizes the obfuscation - erasure distinction and enables the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior across model families and scales.

TL;DR: The paper examines the assumptions behind intrinsic evaluation metrics like perplexity in multilingual settings, finding them not universally comparable due to differences in measuring information content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically assess the assumptions underlying intrinsic metrics (e.g., perplexity) in multilingual language models and their comparability.

Method: Experiments with six metrics on two multi-parallel corpora, using both mono- and multilingual models.

Result: Current metrics are not universally comparable due to inherent issues in measuring information content.

Conclusion: The paper highlights limitations of intrinsic metrics in multilingual contexts, suggesting a need for reevaluation.

Abstract: Intrinsic evaluation metrics for conditional language models, such as perplexity or bits-per-character, are widely used in both mono- and multilingual settings. These metrics are rather straightforward to use and compare in monolingual setups, but rest on a number of assumptions in multilingual setups. One such assumption is that comparing the perplexity of CLMs on parallel sentences is indicative of their quality since the information content (here understood as the semantic meaning) is the same. However, the metrics are inherently measuring information content in the information-theoretic sense. We make this and other such assumptions explicit and discuss their implications. We perform experiments with six metrics on two multi-parallel corpora both with mono- and multilingual models. Ultimately, we find that current metrics are not universally comparable. We look at the form-meaning debate to provide some explanation for this.

TL;DR: TracVC traces verbalized confidence in LLMs to training data, revealing models often mimic superficial confidence expressions rather than genuine content grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs' verbalized confidence often misaligns with factual accuracy and improve their trustworthiness.

Method: Introduces TracVC, combining info retrieval and influence estimation to trace confidence expressions to training data. Evaluates OLMo and Llama models using a new metric, content groundness.

Result: OLMo2-13B is frequently influenced by generic confidence-related data, suggesting superficial mimicry rather than genuine grounding.

Conclusion: Current LLM training may teach models to sound confident without justification. Findings highlight the need for improved training regimes for reliable confidence expression.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can increase users' perceived trust by verbalizing confidence in their outputs. However, prior work has shown that LLMs are often overconfident, making their stated confidence unreliable since it does not consistently align with factual accuracy. To better understand the sources of this verbalized confidence, we introduce TracVC (\textbf{Trac}ing \textbf{V}erbalized \textbf{C}onfidence), a method that builds on information retrieval and influence estimation to trace generated confidence expressions back to the training data. We evaluate TracVC on OLMo and Llama models in a question answering setting, proposing a new metric, content groundness, which measures the extent to which an LLM grounds its confidence in content-related training examples (relevant to the question and answer) versus in generic examples of confidence verbalization. Our analysis reveals that OLMo2-13B is frequently influenced by confidence-related data that is lexically unrelated to the query, suggesting that it may mimic superficial linguistic expressions of certainty rather than rely on genuine content grounding. These findings point to a fundamental limitation in current training regimes: LLMs may learn how to sound confident without learning when confidence is justified. Our analysis provides a foundation for improving LLMs' trustworthiness in expressing more reliable confidence.

TL;DR: The paper explores how persuasion strategies impact text persuasiveness using LLMs and a multi-strategy scoring approach, achieving improved predictions and releasing a topic-annotated dataset for research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding persuasion strategies in argumentative text is crucial for analyzing human communication.

Method: Leverages LLMs with a Multi-Strategy Persuasion Scoring approach to evaluate six strategies across three datasets.

Result: Strategy-guided reasoning enhances persuasiveness prediction; topic-based analysis provides deeper insights.

Conclusion: Structured, strategy-aware prompting improves interpretability and robustness in argument assessment.

Abstract: Detecting persuasion in argumentative text is a challenging task with important implications for understanding human communication. This work investigates the role of persuasion strategies - such as Attack on reputation, Distraction, and Manipulative wording - in determining the persuasiveness of a text. We conduct experiments on three annotated argument datasets: Winning Arguments (built from the Change My View subreddit), Anthropic/Persuasion, and Persuasion for Good. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) with a Multi-Strategy Persuasion Scoring approach that guides reasoning over six persuasion strategies. Results show that strategy-guided reasoning improves the prediction of persuasiveness. To better understand the influence of content, we organize the Winning Argument dataset into broad discussion topics and analyze performance across them. We publicly release this topic-annotated version of the dataset to facilitate future research. Overall, our methodology demonstrates the value of structured, strategy-aware prompting for enhancing interpretability and robustness in argument quality assessment.

### [138] [LIBERTy: A Causal Framework for Benchmarking Concept-Based Explanations of LLMs with Structural Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10700)
*Gilat Toker,Nitay Calderon,Ohad Amosy,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIBERTy is a framework using LLMs to generate structural counterfactual pairs for evaluating concept-based explanations in NLP models, addressing limitations of human-written proxies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks rely on imperfect human-written counterfactuals, limiting effective evaluation of concept-based explanations in high-stakes domains.

Method: LIBERTy uses Structured Causal Models (SCMs) to generate counterfactuals via LLM interventions, introducing datasets and a new metric (order-faithfulness).

Result: Evaluation of five models shows room for improving concept-based explanations; proprietary LLMs exhibit reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts.

Conclusion: LIBERTy offers a scalable benchmark for developing and testing faithful explainability methods.

Abstract: Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.

*Ruozhen Yang,Yucheng Jiang,Yueqi Jiang,Priyanka Kargupta,Yunyi Zhang,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STITCH, a memory system for large language models, uses structured retrieval cues and contextual intent to improve long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions by reducing retrieval noise and mismatched evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in deploying large language models for long-horizon tasks, where recurring entities and facts under different goals cause retrieval mismatches.

Method: Proposes STITCH, which indexes trajectory steps with structured retrieval cues (latent goal, action type, salient entity types) and retrieves history by intent matching.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 35.6% on CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, with significant gains as trajectory length increases.

Conclusion: Intent indexing reduces retrieval noise, enhancing robust long-horizon reasoning.

Abstract: Deploying large language models in long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions remains challenging because similar entities and facts recur under different latent goals and constraints, causing memory systems to retrieve context-mismatched evidence. We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrieval cue, contextual intent, and retrieves history by matching the current step's intent. Contextual intent provides compact signals that disambiguate repeated mentions and reduce interference: (1) the current latent goal defining a thematic segment, (2) the action type, and (3) the salient entity types anchoring which attributes matter. During inference, STITCH filters and prioritizes memory snippets by intent compatibility, suppressing semantically similar but context-incompatible history.
  For evaluation, we introduce CAME-Bench, a benchmark for context-aware retrieval in realistic, dynamic, goal-oriented trajectories. Across CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 35.6%, with the largest gains as trajectory length increases. Our analysis shows that intent indexing substantially reduces retrieval noise, supporting intent-aware memory for robust long-horizon reasoning.

*Changle Qu,Sunhao Dai,Hengyi Cai,Jun Xu,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MatchTIR improves LLM task performance with fine-grained rewards and dual-level advantage estimation, outperforming larger models in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods use coarse-grained rewards, failing to distinguish effective tool calls in multi-turn scenarios.

Method: MatchTIR introduces bipartite matching-based turn-level rewards and dual-level advantage estimation for balanced precision and task success.

Result: MatchTIR outperforms larger models, especially in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks.

Conclusion: Fine-grained supervision and dual-level advantage estimation enhance LLM performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Self-Evolving Concierge System using Dynamic Mixture of Experts to address scalability issues in LLMs, balancing generalization and specialization without introducing latency or resource overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face scalability issues due to context pollution and attention decay in monolithic agents, or latency and overhead in static multi-agent swarms.

Method: The proposed system uses Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DMoE) with a Meta-Cognition Engine, LRU eviction policy, and Surgical History Pruning to dynamically hire specialized sub-agents and mitigate refusal bias.

Result: The architecture achieves high task success rates while minimizing token consumption compared to static agent swarms.

Conclusion: The Self-Evolving Concierge System effectively addresses the Generalization-Specialization Dilemma in LLMs with stability and efficiency.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, they face a critical scalability bottleneck known as the "Generalization-Specialization Dilemma." Monolithic agents equipped with extensive toolkits suffer from context pollution and attention decay, leading to hallucinations. Conversely, static multi-agent swarms introduce significant latency and resource overhead. This paper introduces a Self-Evolving Concierge System, a novel architecture utilizing a Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DMoE) approach. Unlike recent self-improving agents that rewrite their own codebase, our system preserves stability by dynamically restructuring its runtime environment: "hiring" specialized sub-agents based on real-time conversation analysis. We introduce an asynchronous "Meta-Cognition Engine" that detects capability gaps, a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for resource constraints, and a novel "Surgical History Pruning" mechanism to mitigate refusal bias. Experimental results demonstrate that this architecture maintains high task success rates while minimizing token consumption compared to static agent swarms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address modality imbalance and alignment collapse in vision-language models when handling OOD concepts.

Method: Introduces a four-agent system (image, text, name, coordination) for structured message passing, feature space learning, context exchange for few-shot learning, and adaptive balancing.

Result: MACL outperforms baselines on the VISTA-Beyond dataset, with 1-5% precision improvements in few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: The MACL framework effectively mitigates modality imbalance and enhances performance for OOD concepts.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Multi-Agent Cooperative Learning (MACL) framework to address cross-modal alignment collapse in vision-language models when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) concepts. Four core agents, including image, text, name, and coordination agents, collaboratively mitigate modality imbalance through structured message passing. The proposed framework enables multi-agent feature space name learning, incorporates a context exchange enhanced few-shot learning algorithm, and adopts an adaptive dynamic balancing mechanism to regulate inter-agent contributions. Experiments on the VISTA-Beyond dataset demonstrate that MACL significantly improves performance in both few-shot and zero-shot settings, achieving 1-5% precision gains across diverse visual domains.

### [143] [When Personas Override Payoffs: Role Identity Bias in Multi-Agent LLM Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10102)
*Viswonathan Manoranjan,Snehalkumar `Neil' S. Gaikwad*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The study examines how role-based personas and payoff visibility impact strategic reasoning in multi-agent LLM systems, finding that personas bias reasoning toward socially preferred outcomes while explicit payoffs enable strategic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how design choices like personas and payoff visibility affect LLMs' strategic reasoning in multi-agent systems, particularly whether they act as payoff optimizers or identity-driven actors.

Method: Systematic experiments using Nash equilibrium achievement as a diagnostic tool across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in environmental decision-making games with four agents.

Result: Role personas bias reasoning toward socially preferred outcomes (e.g., Green Transition), while explicit payoffs enable Qwen models to achieve Nash equilibrium. Other models (Llama, Mistral) show rigid reasoning.

Conclusion: Design choices (personas, payoffs) determine whether multi-agent systems function as strategic reasoners or identity-driven actors, impacting real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems for strategic tasks, yet how design choices such as role-based personas and payoff visibility affect reasoning remains poorly understood. We investigate whether multi-agent systems function as strategic reasoners capable of payoff optimization or as identity-driven actors that prioritize role alignment over explicit incentives. Using Nash equilibrium achievement as a diagnostic for strategic reasoning, we conduct systematic experiments across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in complex environmental decision-making games involving four agents. We show that role identity bias fundamentally alters strategic reasoning even when payoff-optimal equilibria exist and complete payoff information is available. Removing personas and providing explicit payoffs enables Qwen models to achieve high Nash equilibrium rates, indicating that both conditions are necessary for strategic reasoning. In contrast, personas systematically bias equilibrium selection toward socially preferred outcomes: with personas present, all of the achieved equilibria correspond to Green Transition, while models entirely fail to reach equilibrium when Tragedy of the Commons is payoff-optimal. The effect of explicit payoffs depends entirely on persona presence, revealing strong interactions between representational design choices. We also observe clear model-dependent patterns. Qwen architectures are highly sensitive to both personas and payoff visibility, whereas Llama and Mistral exhibit rigid reasoning behavior across conditions. These findings demonstrate that representational choices are substantive governance decisions that determine whether multi-agent systems act as strategic reasoners or identity-driven actors, with important implications for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from high latency and computation due to sequential multi-round dialogues, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: TopoDIM uses diverse interaction modes for decentralized, one-shot topology generation, enabling autonomous agent communication without iterative coordination.

Result: Achieves a 46.41% reduction in token consumption and a 1.50% performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TopoDIM enhances efficiency, task performance, and adaptability in multi-agent communication.

Abstract: Optimizing communication topology in LLM-based multi-agent system is critical for enabling collective intelligence. Existing methods mainly rely on spatio-temporal interaction paradigms, where the sequential execution of multi-round dialogues incurs high latency and computation. Motivated by the recent insights that evaluation and debate mechanisms can improve problem-solving in multi-agent systems, we propose TopoDIM, a framework for one-shot Topology generation with Diverse Interaction Modes. Designed for decentralized execution to enhance adaptability and privacy, TopoDIM enables agents to autonomously construct heterogeneous communication without iterative coordination, achieving token efficiency and improved task performance. Experiments demonstrate that TopoDIM reduces total token consumption by 46.41% while improving average performance by 1.50% over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework exhibits strong adaptability in organizing communication among heterogeneous agents. Code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TopoDIM-8D35/

TL;DR: The paper addresses Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) for both rational and non-rational agents, proposing heuristic and incentive-compatible solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAPF is crucial for real-world applications like robot motion planning and UAV movement, but its complexity increases with rational agents misreporting information.

Method: For non-rational agents, a heuristic solution is proposed. For rational agents, a mechanism is developed and shown to be dominant strategy, incentive compatible, and individually rational.

Result: The proposed solutions are effective and efficient, as demonstrated through various methodologies.

Conclusion: The study advances MAPF solutions by addressing fairness and rationality, offering practical tools for real-world applications.

Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem aims at finding non-conflicting paths for multiple agents from their respective sources to destinations. This problem arises in multiple real-life situations, including robot motion planning and airspace assignment for unmanned aerial vehicle movement. The problem is computationally expensive, and adding to it, the agents are rational and can misreport their private information. In this paper, we study both variants of the problem under the realm of fairness. For the non-rational agents, we propose a heuristic solution for this problem. Considering the agents are rational, we develop a mechanism and demonstrate that it is a dominant strategy, incentive compatible, and individually rational. We employ various solution methodologies to highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches.

*Zhenyu Zhao,Tiankui Zhang,Xiaoxia Xu,Junjie Li,Yuanwei Liu,Wenjuan Xing*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A novel traffic-adaptive multipath routing method for multi-hop UAV networks, using MADRL to optimize traffic splitting ratios, outperforms benchmarks in latency and packet loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address local congestion and traffic delays in existing single-path routing methods for multi-hop UAV networks.

Method: Proposes a decentralized MADRL algorithm (IPPO-DM) to dynamically split traffic flows across multiple next-hop neighbors, modeled as a Dec-POMDP.

Result: IPPO-DM achieves better performance in delivery latency and packet loss compared to benchmark schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively meets latency requirements and improves network performance in dynamic UAV environments.

Abstract: Multi-hop uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are promising to extend the terrestrial network coverage. Existing multi-hop UAV networks employ a single routing path by selecting the next-hop forwarding node in a hop-by-hop manner, which leads to local congestion and increases traffic delays. In this paper, a novel traffic-adaptive multipath routing method is proposed for multi-hop UAV networks, which enables each UAV to dynamically split and forward traffic flows across multiple next-hop neighbors, thus meeting latency requirements of diverse traffic flows in dynamic mobile environments. An on-time packet delivery ratio maximization problem is formulated to determine the traffic splitting ratios at each hop. This sequential decision-making problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). To solve this Dec-POMDP, a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement leaning (MADRL) algorithm, termed Independent Proximal Policy Optimization with Dirichlet Modeling (IPPO-DM), is developed. Specifically, the IPPO serves as the core optimization framework, where the Dirichlet distribution is leveraged to parameterize a continuous stochastic policy network on the probability simplex, inherently ensuring feasible traffic splitting ratios. Simulation results demonstrate that IPPO-DM outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of both delivery latency guarantee and packet loss performance.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: LAMaS is a latency-aware framework optimizing parallel execution in multi-agent systems, reducing latency by 38-46% while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS approaches often assume sequential execution, leading to high latency, which limits scalability in time-sensitive scenarios.

Method: Proposes LAMaS, a framework that learns to orchestrate agents with explicit latency supervision, optimizing execution topology graphs for parallel execution.

Result: Reduces critical path length by 38-46% vs. baselines, maintaining or improving task performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicit latency optimization under parallel execution is crucial for efficient multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) enable complex reasoning by coordinating multiple agents, but often incur high inference latency due to multi-step execution and repeated model invocations, severely limiting their scalability and usability in time-sensitive scenarios. Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

### [148] [Procedural Fairness in Multi-Agent Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10600)
*Joshua Caiata,Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'procedural fairness' in multi-agent multi-armed bandits (MA-MAB), emphasizing equal decision-making power for agents alongside outcome-based fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness notions in MA-MAB focus mainly on outcomes (e.g., welfare, inequality). The paper argues fairness should also address process (decision-making power), drawing inspiration from psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory.

Method: The authors propose a new fairness objective called 'procedural fairness,' ensuring equal decision-making power for all agents. They empirically compare this with outcome-based fairness notions.

Result: Empirical findings show outcome-based fairness sacrifices equal voice, while procedurally fair policies minimally impact outcome-based objectives (equality, utilitarianism). The study also proves fairness notions prioritize incompatible values.

Conclusion: Procedural legitimacy should be prioritized as a fairness objective. The paper provides a practical framework for implementing procedural fairness, highlighting the need for explicit normative choices in fairness definitions.

Abstract: In the context of multi-agent multi-armed bandits (MA-MAB), fairness is often reduced to outcomes: maximizing welfare, reducing inequality, or balancing utilities. However, evidence in psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory suggests that fairness is also about process and who gets a say in the decisions being made. We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices. This paper argues that procedural legitimacy deserves greater focus as a fairness objective, and provides a framework for putting procedural fairness into practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social Determinants of Health impact patient outcomes but are often missing from structured data. Automating their extraction from clinical text can enhance diagnostic systems by incorporating social context.

Method: The study uses reasoning models and traditional large language models to classify SDoH ICD-9 codes from hospital admissions in the MIMIC-III dataset.

Result: The approach achieved an 89% F1 score and identified missing SDoH codes in 139 admissions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using language models for SDoH classification and highlights gaps in current coding practices.

Abstract: Social Determinants of Health correlate with patient outcomes but are rarely captured in structured data. Recent attention has been given to automatically extracting these markers from clinical text to supplement diagnostic systems with knowledge of patients' social circumstances. Large language models demonstrate strong performance in identifying Social Determinants of Health labels from sentences. However, prediction in large admissions or longitudinal notes is challenging given long distance dependencies. In this paper, we explore hospital admission multi-label Social Determinants of Health ICD-9 code classification on the MIMIC-III dataset using reasoning models and traditional large language models. We exploit existing ICD-9 codes for prediction on admissions, which achieved an 89% F1. Our contributions include our findings, missing SDoH codes in 139 admissions, and code to reproduce the results.

TL;DR: Transformers' self-attention in high-confidence uses tropical algebra, converting softmax to tropical matrix products, revealing dynamic programming on token graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometric and computational basis of Transformer self-attention in high-confidence regimes.

Method: Analyze the tropical limit of softmax attention, linking it to tropical matrix products and dynamic programming.

Result: Self-attention performs Bellman-Ford updates on token graphs, explaining chain-of-thought reasoning as shortest-path algorithms.

Conclusion: Transformers implicitly execute path-finding algorithms, offering insights into their reasoning processes.

Abstract: We prove that the Transformer self-attention mechanism in the high-confidence regime ($β\to \infty$, where $β$ is an inverse temperature) operates in the tropical semiring (max-plus algebra). In particular, we show that taking the tropical limit of the softmax attention converts it into a tropical matrix product. This reveals that the Transformer's forward pass is effectively executing a dynamic programming recurrence (specifically, a Bellman-Ford path-finding update) on a latent graph defined by token similarities. Our theoretical result provides a new geometric perspective for chain-of-thought reasoning: it emerges from an inherent shortest-path (or longest-path) algorithm being carried out within the network's computation.

TL;DR: TimeSAE is a framework using Sparse Autoencoders and causality to provide robust explanations for black-box time series models, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanation methods for black-box time series models lack generalization outside training support, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Introduces TimeSAE, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders and causality for explanations, tested on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: TimeSAE offers more faithful and robust explanations compared to leading baselines.

Conclusion: TimeSAE effectively addresses generalization issues in explaining black-box time series models.

Abstract: As black box models and pretrained models gain traction in time series applications, understanding and explaining their predictions becomes increasingly vital, especially in high-stakes domains where interpretability and trust are essential. However, most of the existing methods involve only in-distribution explanation, and do not generalize outside the training support, which requires the learning capability of generalization. In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality. We show that many current explanation methods are sensitive to distributional shifts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Building on the concept of Sparse Autoencoder, we introduce TimeSAE, a framework for black-box model explanation. We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines. The results, supported by both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, show that TimeSAE provides more faithful and robust explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and efficiency challenges in federated learning (FL) amid statistical heterogeneity and computational demands.

Method: Introduces QFed, a quantum-enabled FL framework, tested on FashionMNIST, reducing parameters in VGG-like models polylogarithmically.

Result: QFed achieves a 77.6% parameter reduction with comparable accuracy to classical methods in scalable settings.

Conclusion: Quantum-assisted FL shows promise for enhancing edge device capabilities efficiently and privately.

Abstract: Organizations and enterprises across domains such as healthcare, finance, and scientific research are increasingly required to extract collective intelligence from distributed, siloed datasets while adhering to strict privacy, regulatory, and sovereignty requirements. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building without sharing sensitive raw data, but faces growing challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and the computational burden from complex models. This study examines the potential of quantum-assisted federated learning, which could cut the number of parameters in classical models by polylogarithmic factors and thus lessen training overhead. Accordingly, we introduce QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework aimed at boosting computational efficiency across edge device networks. We evaluate the proposed framework using the widely adopted FashionMNIST dataset. Experimental results show that QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in the parameter count of a VGG-like model while maintaining an accuracy comparable to classical approaches in a scalable environment. These results point to the potential of leveraging quantum computing within a federated learning context to strengthen FL capabilities of edge devices.

Conclusion: The localized eluder dimension enables better regret bounds, advancing analysis in bandits and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the eluder dimension of generalised linear model classes, showing that standard eluder dimension-based analysis cannot lead to first-order regret bounds. To address this, we introduce a localisation method for the eluder dimension; our analysis immediately recovers and improves on classic results for Bernoulli bandits, and allows for the first genuine first-order bounds for finite-horizon reinforcement learning tasks with bounded cumulative returns.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence proof of PnP-PGD under prior mismatch. Compared with the existing theoretical results for PnP algorithms, our new results removed the need for several restrictive and unverifiable assumptions.

Method: Develops a generalizable pipeline that maps structural fairness to observational healthcare data, defining a target 'fair' model while considering accuracy and bias sources.

Result: Expands the 'fairness-accuracy' tradeoff understanding and demonstrates how foundation models can generate causally fair predictions in tasks with known disparities.

Conclusion: The work provides a model-agnostic pipeline to train causally fair ML models, addressing both direct and indirect healthcare biases.

Abstract: When training machine learning (ML) models for potential deployment in a healthcare setting, it is essential to ensure that they do not replicate or exacerbate existing healthcare biases. Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target "fair" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the "fairness-accuracy" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.

*Jacob Sander,Brian Jalaian,Venkat R. Dasari*

TL;DR: The paper proposes an integrated framework combining GPTQ quantization, LoRA, and data distillation to optimize LLMs for edge devices, achieving significant compression and performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face deployment challenges on resource-constrained edge devices due to high computational, memory, and energy demands.

Method: An integrated framework using GPTQ-based quantization, LoRA, data distillation, knowledge distillation via KL divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer.

Result: Achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., 6GB to 3GB) and superior performance on benchmarks compared to GPTQ alone.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces LLM size and complexity while enhancing task-specific performance, with Muon optimizer improving resistance to accuracy decay.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable advanced natural language processing but face deployment challenges on resource-constrained edge devices due to high computational, memory, and energy demands. Optimizing these models requires addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models to accelerate inference while reducing resource demands. We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.

*Kirandeep Kaur,Vinayak Gupta,Aditya Gupta,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProPer introduces a two-agent system (DGA and RGA) to proactively address unexpressed user needs, improving response quality and timeliness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current assistants often miss unexpressed needs due to reactive designs. Proactive systems either burden users or misintervene.

Method: ProPer uses DGA to generate latent dimensions from user data, filters them, and RGA to balance explicit/implicit needs for personalized responses.

Result: ProPer improves quality scores by up to 84% in single-turn evaluations and excels in multi-turn interactions.

Conclusion: ProPer's architecture effectively addresses gaps in proactive assistance, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Most language-based assistants follow a reactive ask-and-respond paradigm, requiring users to explicitly state their needs. As a result, relevant but unexpressed needs often go unmet. Existing proactive agents attempt to address this gap either by eliciting further clarification, preserving this burden, or by extrapolating future needs from context, often leading to unnecessary or mistimed interventions. We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.

*Chenxi Qiu*

TL;DR: An interpolation-based framework optimizes metric differential privacy (mDP) in fine-grained domains by using sparse anchor points and log-convex interpolation, ensuring privacy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained or continuous settings due to computational costs and dense perturbation matrices, necessitating an efficient solution.

Method: Proposes an interpolation-based framework using sparse anchor points and log-convex combinations, decomposing high-dimensional interpolation into one-dimensional steps for corrected privacy enforcement.

Result: Experiments show rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming baseline mechanisms.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses challenges in optimizing mDP for fine-grained settings, balancing privacy and utility.

Abstract: Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) generalizes Local Differential Privacy (LDP) by adapting privacy guarantees based on pairwise distances, enabling context-aware protection and improved utility. While existing optimization-based methods reduce utility loss effectively in coarse-grained domains, optimizing mDP in fine-grained or continuous settings remains challenging due to the computational cost of constructing dense perterubation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.
  In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based framework for optimizing lp-norm mDP in such domains. Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP. To address privacy violations caused by naive interpolation in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design. We further explore joint optimization over perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation across dimensions. Experiments on real-world location datasets demonstrate that our method offers rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming baseline mechanisms. in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers struggle with noisy continuous signals. Kinematic Tokenization reconstructs splines from noisy data, improving financial trading policies under risk-averse objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete tokenizations can fail in noisy, asymmetric penalty scenarios, necessitating a robust continuous-time representation.

Method: Develop Kinematic Tokenization, which reconstructs splines from noisy data and tokenizes local coefficients (position, velocity, etc.), applied to financial time series.

Result: Continuous spline tokens outperform discrete baselines, sustaining stable policies under risk-averse objectives.

Conclusion: Continuous-time tokens enhance learnability and calibration in noisy time series with abstention-inducing losses.

Abstract: Transformers are designed for discrete tokens, yet many real-world signals are continuous processes observed through noisy sampling. Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights structural unsustainability in the machine learning value chain due to economic inequities favoring aggregators over data creators, proposing an Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework to address disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from observed economic inequality in the machine learning value chain, where data creators receive minimal royalties while aggregators capture most value, threatening the sustainability of current learning algorithms.

Method: The authors analyze seventy-three public data deals to uncover value distribution patterns and identify three structural faults: missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing.

Result: Analysis reveals that most value accrues to aggregators, with negligible royalties for creators and opaque deal terms, reinforcing economic inequity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proposing the EDVEX Framework to create a fairer market and suggests research directions to improve data deals.

Abstract: We argue that the machine learning value chain is structurally unsustainable due to an economic data processing inequality: each state in the data cycle from inputs to model weights to synthetic outputs refines technical signal but strips economic equity from data generators. We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk. We identify three structural faults - missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing - as the operational machinery of this inequality. In our analysis, we trace these problems along the machine learning value chain and propose an Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework to enable a minimal market that benefits all participants. Finally, we outline research directions where our community can make concrete contributions to data deals and contextualize our position with related and orthogonal viewpoints.

Motivation: To leverage LLMs' reasoning and generalization abilities for time series classification, addressing gaps in encoder architecture exploration.

Method: Evaluated various encoder families (Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, MLP) integrated with frozen LLMs.

Result: Inception models consistently improved performance when combined with LLMs, unlike other encoder architectures.

Conclusion: Inception-based models are promising for future LLM-driven time series learning, emphasizing encoder choice's impact.

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a core machine learning problem with broad applications. Recently there has been growing interest in repurposing large language models (LLMs) for TSC, motivated by their strong reasoning and generalization ability. Prior work has primarily focused on alignment strategies that explicitly map time series data into the textual domain; however, the choice of time series encoder architecture remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study of hybrid architectures that combine specialized time series encoders with a frozen LLM backbone. We evaluate a diverse set of encoder families, including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron architectures, among which the Inception model is the only encoder architecture that consistently yields positive performance gains when integrated with an LLM backbone. Overall, this study highlights the impact of time series encoder choice in hybrid LLM architectures and points to Inception-based models as a promising direction for future LLM-driven time series learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a method for learning OT maps efficiently with minimal data and computational overhead during inference.

Method: The method involves parameterizing the solution operator and analyzing its performance in nonparametric and parametric settings, with theoretical bounds and an explicit architecture for exact OT recovery in parametric cases.

Result: Theoretical bounds are established for generalization in nonparametric settings, and finite-sample excess-risk bounds are provided for parametric settings. Experiments validate the approach.

Conclusion: The framework successfully learns OT maps in-context with few-shot samples, demonstrating practical applicability on synthetic and generative-modeling tasks.

Abstract: We introduce \emph{in-context operator learning on probability measure spaces} for optimal transport (OT). The goal is to learn a single solution operator that maps a pair of distributions to the OT map, using only few-shot samples from each distribution as a prompt and \emph{without} gradient updates at inference. We parameterize the solution operator and develop scaling-law theory in two regimes. In the \emph{nonparametric} setting, when tasks concentrate on a low-intrinsic-dimension manifold of source--target pairs, we establish generalization bounds that quantify how in-context accuracy scales with prompt size, intrinsic task dimension, and model capacity. In the \emph{parametric} setting (e.g., Gaussian families), we give an explicit architecture that recovers the exact OT map in context and provide finite-sample excess-risk bounds. Our numerical experiments on synthetic transports and generative-modeling benchmarks validate the framework.

*Tianqi Zhang,Flavio Ponzina,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FaTRQ is a far-memory-aware refinement system that eliminates fetching full vectors by using tiered memory and a progressive distance estimator, achieving 2.4× storage efficiency and up to 9× throughput improvement over SOTA GPU ANNS systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ANNS engines suffer from costly second-pass refinement stages that read full-precision vectors from slow storage, dominating query latency.

Method: FaTRQ uses tiered memory, progressive distance estimation for early refinement stopping, and tiered residual quantization for efficient storage. A custom accelerator in a CXL Type-2 device enables local refinement.

Result: FaTRQ improves storage efficiency by 2.4× and throughput by up to 9× compared to state-of-the-art GPU ANNS systems.

Conclusion: FaTRQ effectively addresses the latency issue in ANNS by leveraging tiered memory and efficient refinement techniques, significantly outperforming existing systems.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key technique in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enabling rapid identification of the most relevant high-dimensional embeddings from massive vector databases. Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory. A custom accelerator is deployed in a CXL Type-2 device to perform low-latency refinement locally. Together, FaTRQ improves the storage efficiency by 2.4$\times$ and improves the throughput by up to 9$ \times$ than SOTA GPU ANNS system.

*Peter Jemley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid transformer with continuous-depth Neural ODE block allows control over generation attributes via a steering signal, achieving stable gradients, high accuracy in sentiment control, low trajectory divergence, and efficiency comparable to discrete baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance transformer architectures by replacing fixed discrete layers with continuous-depth dynamics, enabling flexible and efficient control over generation attributes.

Method: Proposes a hybrid transformer using a Neural ODE block, where depth is continuous and controlled by a learned vector field with an injected low-dimensional signal. Validated through stability, steering, interpolation, and efficiency tests.

Result: Achieves stable gradients, 98%/88% sentiment control accuracy, 0.068% trajectory divergence, and latency parity with discrete baselines. Adaptive solvers reveal geometric structure in dynamics.

Conclusion: Continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals offer an efficient and viable approach for steerable language generation in transformers.

Abstract: We present a hybrid transformer architecture that replaces discrete middle layers with a continuous-depth Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) block, enabling inference-time control over generation attributes via a learned steering signal. Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_θ(H, τ, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\%/88\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARSE is a multimodal decentralized federated learning framework that addresses gradient misalignment in heterogeneous agent collaboration by using partial information decomposition and slice-level alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in multimodal decentralized federated learning (DFL) where agents vary in modalities and architectures, and lack central coordination.

Method: Introduces PARSE, which uses partial information decomposition (PID) to factorize latent representations into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices, enabling P2P knowledge sharing via slice-level alignment.

Result: PARSE outperforms task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines, resolving gradient conflicts and improving cross-modal interaction.

Conclusion: PARSE efficiently addresses multimodal DFL challenges without central coordination, demonstrating robustness and compatibility with standard DFL constraints.

Abstract: Multimodal decentralized federated learning (DFL) is challenging because agents differ in available modalities and model architectures, yet must collaborate over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks without a central coordinator. Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines. Ablations on fusion operators and split ratios, together with qualitative visualizations, further demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed design.

TL;DR: CAFEDistill enhances Personalized Federated Learning with adaptive early-exit networks, resolving client and depth conflicts for better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PFL methods lack adaptability to varying inference needs and resource constraints, while early-exit networks face challenges in federated settings due to heterogeneity and conflicting objectives.

Method: CAFEDistill uses a conflict-aware framework with depth-prioritized student coordination to mitigate interference and enable personalized knowledge transfer, while reducing communication overhead.

Result: CAFEDistill achieves higher accuracy and reduces inference costs by 30.79%-46.86% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CAFEDistill successfully integrates early-exit networks into PFL, addressing key conflicts and improving performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables collaboratively model training on decentralized, heterogeneous data while tailoring them to each client's unique distribution. However, existing PFL methods produce static models with a fixed tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, limiting their applicability in environments where inference requirements vary with contexts and resource availability. Early-exit networks (EENs) offer adaptive inference by attaching intermediate classifiers. Yet integrating them into PFL is challenging due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference arising from conflicting exit objectives. Prior studies fail to resolve both conflicts simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose CAFEDistill, a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework that jointly addresses these conflicts and extends PFL to early-exit networks. Through a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism, CAFEDistill mitigates interference among shallow and deep exits while allowing effective personalized knowledge transfer across clients. Furthermore, it reduces communication overhead via a client-decoupled formulation. Extensive evaluations show that CAFEDistill outperforms the state-of-the-arts, achieving higher accuracy and reducing inference costs by 30.79%-46.86%.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates time aggregation features for XGBoost models in click-through rate prediction, finding trailing windows improve performance slightly over baseline target encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve click-through rate prediction models by comparing time-aware target encoding with entity history time aggregation features.

Method: Uses Avazu dataset with out-of-time splits and no-lookahead constraints. Evaluates trailing, event count, gap, and bucketized window designs.

Result: Trailing windows boost ROC AUC by 0.0066-0.0082 and PR AUC by 0.0084-0.0094. Event count windows also help slightly.

Conclusion: Trailing windows are recommended as a default, with optional event count windows for marginal gains.

Abstract: This paper studies time aggregation features for XGBoost models in click-through rate prediction. The setting is the Avazu click-through rate prediction dataset with strict out-of-time splits and a no-lookahead feature constraint. Features for hour H use only impressions from hours strictly before H. This paper compares a strong time-aware target encoding baseline to models augmented with entity history time aggregation under several window designs. Across two rolling-tail folds on a deterministic ten percent sample, a trailing window specification improves ROC AUC by about 0.0066 to 0.0082 and PR AUC by about 0.0084 to 0.0094 relative to target encoding alone. Within the time aggregation design grid, event count windows provide the only consistent improvement over trailing windows, and the gain is small. Gap windows and bucketized windows underperform simple trailing windows in this dataset and protocol. These results support a practical default of trailing windows, with an optional event count window when marginal ROC AUC gains matter.

*Yanxin Liu,Yunqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework improves ensemble learning by focusing on individual model behaviors rather than inter-model divergence, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods overlook individual model behaviors and rely heavily on validation sets. The BPE framework addresses this by profiling intrinsic model behaviors.

Method: BPE constructs a behavioral profile for each model and weights integrations based on deviations from this profile for specific test instances.

Result: Experiments show BPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble methods in predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and storage utilization.

Conclusion: The BPE framework offers a superior approach to ensemble learning by leveraging intrinsic model behaviors, proving effective across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is widely recognized as a pivotal strategy for pushing the boundaries of predictive performance. Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines. These gains are evident not only in predictive accuracy but also in computational efficiency and storage resource utilization across various scenarios.

*Renpu Liu,Jing Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an augmented in-context learning (ICL) framework using both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance transformer performance, showing provable accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of few labeled demonstrations in ICL by leveraging unlabeled data, which is abundant but underutilized in traditional ICL settings.

Method: The framework combines labeled examples with unlabeled inputs in the prompt, using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to emulate an EM algorithm for multi-class linear classification.

Result: The augmented ICL framework outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, with theoretical and empirical validation of its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the first theoretical study on leveraging unlabeled data to improve transformer-based ICL, offering a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, yet the quality of their predictions is fundamentally limited by the few costly labeled demonstrations that can fit into a prompt. Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study on the impact of unlabeled data on the ICL performance of transformers.

*Hung Vinh Tran,Tong Chen,Hechuan Wen,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Bin Cui,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a framework for improving content-based recommendation systems by selecting representative coresets while correcting noisy labels and filtering unreliable interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content-based recommendation systems require large-scale training, which is computationally expensive. Existing coreset selection methods are vulnerable to noise in user-item interactions.

Method: NaCS uses submodular optimization for coreset selection, corrects noisy labels via progressive training, and filters low-confidence samples using uncertainty quantification.

Result: NaCS achieves 93-95% of full-dataset performance with only 1% of training data, outperforming existing coreset techniques.

Conclusion: NaCS efficiently improves CRS training by reducing computational costs and handling noise, making it a promising solution.

Abstract: Content-based recommendation systems (CRSs) utilize content features to predict user-item interactions, serving as essential tools for helping users navigate information-rich web services. However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\% of the training data.

Motivation: To address subjectivity and variability in sperm morphology evaluation by leveraging AI for more reliable predictions.

Method: HuSHeM, trained on high-resolution sperm images, was evaluated against WHO(+SIRI) using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility metrics.

Result: HuSHeM outperformed WHO(+SIRI) in discriminative performance, calibration, and clinical benefit, especially under class imbalance.

Conclusion: Deep learning offers more reliable sperm morphology assessment than traditional methods, serving as a decision-support tool without replacing clinical judgment.

Abstract: Assessment of sperm morphological quality remains a critical yet subjective component of male fertility evaluation, often limited by inter-observer variability and resource constraints. This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).
  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.
  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria. The proposed framework supports objective and reproducible assessment of sperm morphology and may serve as a decision-support tool within fertility screening and referral workflows. The proposed models are intended as decision-support or referral tools and are not designed to replace clinical judgment or laboratory assessment.

TL;DR: Sparse-RL addresses memory overhead in RL training by correcting policy mismatch caused by KV cache compression, maintaining performance while reducing overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The substantial memory overhead of storing KV caches during RL training limits efficiency on limited hardware, and existing compression techniques cause severe policy mismatch.

Method: Introduces Sparse-RL with Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct off-policy bias from compression.

Result: Reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving performance. Enhances model robustness for sparse inference deployment.

Conclusion: Sparse-RL effectively mitigates memory overhead and policy mismatch in RL training, maintaining performance and improving robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become essential for eliciting complex reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.

*Zan Chaudhry,Noam H. Rotenberg,Brian Caffo,Craig K. Jones,Haris I. Sair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALED is a novel method for detecting mislabeled samples in machine learning datasets, improving model performance by correcting label errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models suffer from poor performance due to incorrect ground truth labels, even with expert curation. Addressing mislabeling is crucial for developing better models.

Method: ALED extracts features from a CNN, denoises them, models each class's manifold with Gaussian distributions, and uses a likelihood ratio test to detect mislabeled samples.

Result: ALED outperforms existing methods in sensitivity without losing precision, reducing test errors by 33.8% after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: ALED is an effective tool for label error detection, offering significant performance improvements and is available as a Python package.

Abstract: Machine learning classification systems are susceptible to poor performance when trained with incorrect ground truth labels, even when data is well-curated by expert annotators. As machine learning becomes more widespread, it is increasingly imperative to identify and correct mislabeling to develop more powerful models. In this work, we motivate and describe Adaptive Label Error Detection (ALED), a novel method of detecting mislabeling. ALED extracts an intermediate feature space from a deep convolutional neural network, denoises the features, models the reduced manifold of each class with a multidimensional Gaussian distribution, and performs a simple likelihood ratio test to identify mislabeled samples. We show that ALED has markedly increased sensitivity, without compromising precision, compared to established label error detection methods, on multiple medical imaging datasets. We demonstrate an example where fine-tuning a neural network on corrected data results in a 33.8% decrease in test set errors, providing strong benefits to end users. The ALED detector is deployed in the Python package statlab.

TL;DR: The paper highlights flaws in meta-analyses due to missing key variables in medical studies and proposes a Bayesian approach to address uncertainty and improve decision-making, demonstrated in TOLAC scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the unreliability of meta-analyses when key decision variables are missing, particularly in medical studies affecting physician decisions.

Method: A Bayesian approach is developed to analyze scenarios with missing data, specifically applied to TOLAC situations where interventions are limited.

Result: The Bayesian method helps assess the validity of positive effect claims and supports physicians in making informed decisions for patient care.

Conclusion: The Bayesian approach offers a solution to unreliable conclusions in meta-analyses, proving useful in medical settings like TOLAC evaluations.

Abstract: The meta-analysis's utility is dependent on previous studies having accurately captured the variables of interest, but in medical studies, a key decision variable that impacts a physician's decisions was not captured. This results in an unknown effect size and unreliable conclusions. A Bayesian approach may allow analysis to determine if the claim of a positive effect is still warranted, and we build a Bayesian approach to this common medical scenario. To demonstrate its utility, we assist professional OBGYNs in evaluating Trial of Labor After a Cesarean-section (TOLAC) situations where few interventions are available for patients and find the support needed for physicians to advance patient care.

*Jongseok Kim,Seongae Kang,Jonghwan Shin,Yuhan Lee,Ohyun Jo*

TL;DR: LeMoF is a novel multimodal fusion framework for clinical prediction that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality, outperforming existing methods in ICU length of stay prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods rely on static integration schemes and simple fusion strategies, failing to fully exploit modality-specific representations.

Method: Proposes Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), which separates and learns global modality-level predictions and level-specific discriminative representations.

Result: LeMoF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in ICU length of stay prediction and demonstrates robust performance across clinical conditions.

Conclusion: Level-wise integration is crucial for robust predictive performance in heterogeneous clinical environments.

Abstract: Multimodal clinical prediction is widely used to integrate heterogeneous data such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) and biosignals. However, existing methods tend to rely on static modality integration schemes and simple fusion strategies. As a result, they fail to fully exploit modality-specific representations. In this paper, we propose Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality. Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations. We also confirmed that level-wise integration is a key factor in achieving robust predictive performance across various clinical conditions.

TL;DR: METAL introduces a lightweight alignment method using English text to map multilingual text embeddings into multimodal space, achieving strong performance and zero-shot transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models perform poorly in non-English languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources, motivating the need for efficient alignment methods.

Method: METAL learns linear layers with English text to align multilingual text embeddings into multimodal space.

Result: METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9% Recall@10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5% Recall@10 across 11 languages).

Conclusion: METAL is effective for multilingual multimodal tasks, generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual generation, and releases resources for further research.

Abstract: Multimodal models excel in English, supported by abundant image-text and audio-text data, but performance drops sharply for other languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources. Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation. We release code and checkpoints at https://github.com/m2m-codebase/M2M , as well as multilingual evaluation datasets including MSCOCO Multilingual 30K (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/mscoco-multilingual-30k ), AudioCaps Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/audiocaps-multilingual ), and Clotho Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/clotho-multilingual ), to facilitate further research.

*Ziyi Ding,Chenfei Ye-Hao,Zheyuan Wang,Xiao-Ping Zhang*

TL;DR: Tree-Query is a tree-structured LLM framework for causal discovery, offering interpretable judgments and robustness-aware confidence scores, outperforming traditional and LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical causal discovery methods suffer from error propagation, while LLM-based approaches lack transparency and confidence metrics.

Method: Tree-Query reduces causal discovery to queries about backdoor paths, (in)dependence, latent confounding, and causal direction.

Result: Tree-Query improves structural metrics over baselines and provides stable, high-confidence causal conclusions.

Conclusion: Tree-Query offers a principled, data-free approach to causal discovery using LLMs, complementing data-driven methods.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover ``what causes what'', but classical constraint-based methods (e.g., PC, FCI) suffer from error propagation, and recent LLM-based causal oracles often behave as opaque, confidence-free black boxes. This paper introduces Tree-Query, a tree-structured, multi-expert LLM framework that reduces pairwise causal discovery to a short sequence of queries about backdoor paths, (in)dependence, latent confounding, and causal direction, yielding interpretable judgments with robustness-aware confidence scores. Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the safety-utility dilemma in fine-tuning LLMs by analyzing gradient interactions and proposes a lightweight method, SPF, to preserve safety without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs for downstream tasks often degrades safety alignment, creating a trade-off between safety and utility. Existing methods fail to resolve this dilemma effectively.

Method: The paper introduces safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), which analyzes gradient subspaces and removes conflicting components to maintain safety alignment.

Result: SPF ensures utility convergence and bounds safety drift, maintaining task performance and recovering safety alignment even under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The study offers a mechanistic understanding and practical solution for always-aligned LLM fine-tuning, robust against deep fine-tuning and jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an essential and pervasive functionality for applying large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.
  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in graph contrastive learning, such as data enhancement discrepancies and reliance on negative samples, for better node classification.

Method: Uses Laplace smoothing filters for feature matrices, siamese networks, and an improved triple recombination loss function.

Result: SNGCL demonstrates strong competitiveness in node classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: SNGCL effectively improves graph contrastive learning for node classification by addressing key challenges.

Abstract: The effectiveness of contrastive learning methods has been widely recognized in the field of graph learning, especially in contexts where graph data often lack labels or are difficult to label. However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model training. Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL). Specifically, SNGCL employs a superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filter as a step in processing the data to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, respectively, which are thus passed into the target and online networks of the siamese network, and finally employs an improved triple recombination loss function to bring the intra-class distance closer and the inter-class distance farther. We have compared SNGCL with state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, and the experimental results show that SNGCL is strongly competitive in most tasks.

TL;DR: LOOKAT compresses KV cache for edge deployment by using product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, achieving high compression with minimal fidelity loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language model deployment on edge devices by reducing KV cache bandwidth without architecture changes or training.

Method: Applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation to transform attention from memory-bound to compute-bound, using lookup tables for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 64× compression at 95.7% fidelity and 32× compression at 95.0% fidelity on GPT-2, with rank correlation ρ > 0.95.

Conclusion: LOOKAT effectively compresses KV cache with high fidelity, validated by theoretical and empirical results, making it suitable for edge deployment.

Abstract: Compressing the KV cache is a required step to deploy large language models on edge devices. Current quantization methods compress storage but fail to reduce bandwidth as attention calculation requires dequantizing keys from INT4/INT8 to FP16 before use. We observe that attention scoring is mathematically equivalent to the inner product similarity search and we can apply some compression techniques from vector databases to compress KV-cache better. We propose LOOKAT, which applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, to transformer architecture by decomposing key vectors into subspaces, learning codebooks and computing attention tables via lookup tables. This transforms attention from memory-bound to compute-bound. LOOKAT achieves 64 $\times$ compression at 95.7\% output fidelity and 32 $\times$ compression at 95.0\% fidelity when tested on GPT-2. LOOKAT requires no architecture changes or training while maintaining rank correlation $ρ> 0.95$. Theoretical analysis confirms that rank correlation degrades as $O(d_k/mK)$, with guarantees validated across sequence lengths up to 1024 tokens.

TL;DR: CC-OR-Net is a novel framework for Customer Lifetime Value prediction, addressing zero-inflated and long-tail data by structurally decomposing ranking and regression, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve challenges in LTV prediction caused by zero-inflated and long-tail data distributions, where existing methods fail to balance accuracy and precision for high-value users.

Method: The proposed CC-OR-Net framework uses structural decomposition with three modules: structural ordinal decomposition for ranking, intra-bucket residual for fine regression, and high-value augmentation for precision.

Result: Evaluated on datasets with over 300M users, CC-OR-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior trade-offs in key business metrics.

Conclusion: CC-OR-Net provides a holistic and commercially valuable solution for LTV prediction, addressing critical challenges through its architectural design.

Abstract: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, a central problem in modern marketing, is characterized by a unique zero-inflated and long-tail data distribution. This distribution presents two fundamental challenges: (1) the vast majority of low-to-medium value users numerically overwhelm the small but critically important segment of high-value "whale" users, and (2) significant value heterogeneity exists even within the low-to-medium value user base. Common approaches either rely on rigid statistical assumptions or attempt to decouple ranking and regression using ordered buckets; however, they often enforce ordinality through loss-based constraints rather than inherent architectural design, failing to balance global accuracy with high-value precision. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{C}ascaded \textbf{O}rdinal-\textbf{R}esidual Networks \textbf{(CC-OR-Net)}, a novel unified framework that achieves a more robust decoupling through \textbf{structural decomposition}, where ranking is architecturally guaranteed. CC-OR-Net integrates three specialized components: a \textit{structural ordinal decomposition module} for robust ranking, an \textit{intra-bucket residual module} for fine-grained regression, and a \textit{targeted high-value augmentation module} for precision on top-tier users. Evaluated on real-world datasets with over 300M users, CC-OR-Net achieves a superior trade-off across all key business metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in creating a holistic and commercially valuable LTV prediction solution.

TL;DR: BiasSeeker is a semi-automated, model-agnostic framework for detecting shortcut features in encrypted traffic, improving generalization by emphasizing context-aware feature selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained models for encrypted network traffic classification often rely on spurious correlations (shortcut learning), limiting generalization. Existing solutions lack adaptability across models and scenarios.

Method: BiasSeeker performs statistical correlation analysis on raw binary traffic to identify spurious features. It introduces a categorization of shortcut features and applies category-specific validation strategies.

Result: Evaluated on 19 public datasets across three tasks, BiasSeeker successfully identifies problematic features, reducing bias while preserving useful information.

Conclusion: BiasSeeker highlights the importance of intentional, scenario-sensitive feature selection before model training to mitigate shortcut learning in encrypted traffic classification.

Abstract: Pre-trained models operating directly on raw bytes have achieved promising performance in encrypted network traffic classification (NTC), but often suffer from shortcut learning-relying on spurious correlations that fail to generalize to real-world data. Existing solutions heavily rely on model-specific interpretation techniques, which lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose BiasSeeker, the first semi-automated framework that is both model-agnostic and data-driven for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic. By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information.
  We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a NorthEast monsoon climate index using sea surface temperature and reinforcement learning to improve long-term rainfall prediction in Thailand.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing global climate indices lack local-scale applicability for specific regions in Thailand, necessitating a tailored index.

Method: A Deep Q-Network agent optimizes sea surface temperature rectangles for correlation with rainfall. Rainfall stations are clustered, and the index is integrated into LSTM models.

Result: The optimized index reduces Root Mean Square Error in 12-month-ahead rainfall forecasts for most clusters.

Conclusion: Local-scale climate indices, optimized via reinforcement learning, enhance predictive accuracy for regional rainfall.

Abstract: Climate prediction is a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal patterns within Earth systems. Global climate indices, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA) improves PCA for high-dimensional data with non-isotropic noise by incorporating feature dependencies via graph-based regularization, enhancing interpretability and structural fidelity without compromising predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA assumes isotropic noise, which is often violated in high-dimensional data. GR-PCA addresses this by leveraging feature dependencies through graph regularization.

Method: GR-PCA learns a sparse precision graph and biases loadings toward low-frequency Fourier modes of the graph Laplacian, suppressing high-frequency noise while preserving graph-coherent signals.

Result: GR-PCA outperforms PCA in concentrating variance on intended support, producing lower-energy loadings, and maintaining competitive reconstruction accuracy, especially for graph-correlated high-frequency signals.

Conclusion: GR-PCA offers a scalable, modular solution for structure-aware dimensionality reduction, balancing structural fidelity and predictive performance.

Abstract: High-dimensional data often exhibit dependencies among variables that violate the isotropic-noise assumption under which principal component analysis (PCA) is optimal. For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.

TL;DR: PRL decomposes RL objectives into intermediate steps with rigorous process rewards, improving LLM reasoning without extra steps like MCTS or reward models, verified by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack fine-grained supervision during reasoning and rely on inefficient steps like MCTS or reward models, with unclear theoretical support for process signals.

Method: PRL decomposes entropy-regularized RL objectives into steps, assigning rigorous process rewards derived from theoretical motivation (reward maximization + KL penalty).

Result: PRL improves LLM reasoning (average @ n and pass @ n metrics) and generalizes effectively in experiments.

Conclusion: PRL provides a theoretically grounded, efficient framework for enhancing LLM reasoning by transforming outcome rewards into process supervision signals.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.

*Murat Bilgehan Ertan,Marten van Dijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SGD's privacy-utility trade-off is constrained under worst-case adversarial models, imposing strict noise requirements that limit utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental limitations of DP-SGD under adversarial privacy definitions and quantify its privacy-utility trade-off.

Method: Analysis in the $f$-differential privacy framework, focusing on shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates.

Result: Derived a suboptimal upper bound on the trade-off curve, showing strict lower bounds on noise ($σ$) and separation ($κ$). Noise requirements degrade utility.

Conclusion: DP-SGD cannot achieve strong privacy and high utility simultaneously under standard adversarial assumptions, highlighting a critical bottleneck.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is the dominant paradigm for private training, but its fundamental limitations under worst-case adversarial privacy definitions remain poorly understood. We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $κ$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $κ$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $σ$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy
  $σ\ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln M}}$ $\quad\text{or}\quad$ $κ\ge\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}\!\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{4π\ln M}}\right)$,
  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \to \infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.

*Hongru Duan,Yongle Chen,Lei Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM aims to improve generalization by minimizing perturbed loss in parameter neighborhoods, but its optimization behavior sometimes fails to align with theory. The paper analyzes SAM spectrally and geometrically, proposing X-SAM for better gradient correction and sharper regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observed misalignment between SAM's theoretical goals and practical optimization behavior motivates a deeper analysis of its sharpness regularization.

Method: The study measures sharpness via the gradient-Hessian eigenvector angle and proposes X-SAM, which adjusts gradients orthogonally along the top eigenvector.

Result: X-SAM demonstrates improved convergence and generalization, validated theoretically and experimentally.

Conclusion: X-SAM effectively addresses SAM's limitations by better aligning gradient corrections with sharpness regularization goals.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) aims to improve generalization by minimizing a worst-case perturbed loss over a small neighborhood of model parameters. However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue. We prove X-SAM's convergence and superior generalization, with extensive experimental evaluations confirming both theoretical and practical advantages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To monitor turbofan engine health without needing run-to-failure labels, enabling quick deployment and scalability.

Method: Regression-based normalization removes operating-condition effects; LSTM autoencoder trained on healthy data triggers alerts via adaptive thresholds.

Result: High recall and low false-alarm rates across multiple operating regimes.

Conclusion: The method is deployable quickly, scalable, and complements Remaining Useful Life models.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unsupervised health-monitoring framework for turbofan engines that does not require run-to-failure labels. First, operating-condition effects in NASA CMAPSS sensor streams are removed via regression-based normalisation; then a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder is trained only on the healthy portion of each trajectory. Persistent reconstruction error, estimated using an adaptive data-driven threshold, triggers real-time alerts without hand-tuned rules. Benchmark results show high recall and low false-alarm rates across multiple operating regimes, demonstrating that the method can be deployed quickly, scale to diverse fleets, and serve as a complementary early-warning layer to Remaining Useful Life models.

### [189] [Queueing-Aware Optimization of Reasoning Tokens for Accuracy-Latency Trade-offs in LLM Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10274)
*Emre Ozbas,Melih Bastopcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a large language model (LLM) server handling heterogeneous queries with varying task types. It optimizes token allocation to balance accuracy and latency, ensuring system stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between accuracy and latency in LLM servers by optimizing token allocation for diverse task types under queue stability constraints.

Method: Formulate a constrained optimization problem to maximize weighted accuracy penalized by system time, using a concave objective function. Solve via fixed-point iteration and gradient methods, with integer solutions derived via rounding.

Result: The optimization ensures unique, stable token allocations. Simulation evaluates performance loss from rounding continuous solutions to integers.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances accuracy and latency for heterogeneous LLM queries, with practical solutions via iterative methods and rounding.

Abstract: We consider a single large language model (LLM) server that serves a heterogeneous stream of queries belonging to $N$ distinct task types. Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.

### [190] [SPIKE: Sparse Koopman Regularization for Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10282)
*Jose Marie Antonio Minoza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPIKE enhances PINNs by integrating Koopman operators for better generalization and stability in solving PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs often overfit within training domains, limiting their generalization capability. SPIKE aims to address this by embedding Koopman operators for sparser, more stable dynamics.

Method: SPIKE regularizes PINNs using continuous-time Koopman operators with L1 regularization, enforcing linear dynamics in a learned observable space.

Result: Experiments show SPIKE improves temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy across various PDEs and chaotic ODEs.

Conclusion: SPIKE effectively mitigates PINNs' overfitting issues, offering a stable and generalizable framework for solving differential equations.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach for solving differential equations by embedding physical constraints into neural network training. However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.

*Zhipeng Liu,Peibo Duan,Xuan Tang,Haodong Jing,Mingyang Geng,Yongsheng Huang,Jialu Xu,Bin Zhang,Binwu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DualCD, a lightweight and robust framework for domain incremental learning in time series classification, addressing challenges by disentangling and intervening in causal and spurious features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series classification models struggle with domain incremental learning, necessitating a solution that enhances robustness without heavy computational costs.

Method: DualCD employs a temporal feature disentanglement module and a dual-causal intervention mechanism to isolate and utilize class-causal features while mitigating confounding effects.

Result: Experiments show DualCD improves performance in domain incremental scenarios across multiple datasets and models.

Conclusion: DualCD offers a scalable and effective approach for domain incremental time series classification, supported by a comprehensive benchmark.

Abstract: The World Wide Web thrives on intelligent services that rely on accurate time series classification, which has recently witnessed significant progress driven by advances in deep learning. However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that DualCD effectively improves performance in domain incremental scenarios. We summarize our rich experiments into a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate research in domain incremental time series classification.

### [192] [Meta Dynamic Graph for Traffic Flow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10328)
*Yiqing Zou,Hanning Yuan,Qianyu Yang,Ziqiang Yuan,Shuliang Wang,Sijie Ruan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MetaDG, a novel framework leveraging dynamic graph structures to model spatio-temporal dynamics in traffic flow prediction, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies and heterogeneity separately. The paper aims to bridge these gaps by unifying dynamic modeling.

Method: MetaDG uses dynamic graph structures to generate dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology and unifying spatio-temporal heterogeneity.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets confirm MetaDG's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MetaDG advances traffic flow prediction by integrating dynamic modeling and spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a unified framework.

Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a typical spatio-temporal prediction problem and has a wide range of applications. The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.

### [193] [SuS: Strategy-aware Surprise for Intrinsic Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10349)
*Mark Kashirskiy,Ilya Makarov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SuS is a novel intrinsic motivation framework combining Strategy Stability and Strategy Surprise for improved exploration in reinforcement learning, showing significant gains in accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional curiosity-driven methods rely only on state prediction error, lacking a way to measure behavioral strategy consistency or unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's strategy. SuS addresses this gap.

Method: SuS introduces Strategy Stability (SS) to measure behavioral consistency and Strategy Surprise (SuS) to capture unexpected outcomes. These are combined with learned weighting coefficients for exploration rewards.

Result: SuS improves Pass@1 by 17.4% and Pass@5 by 26.4% over baselines, with higher strategy diversity. Ablation shows each component is vital, with removals causing ≥10% performance drops.

Conclusion: The synergy of SS and SuS enhances exploration, validating SuS as an effective framework for reinforcement learning tasks, particularly with large language models.

Abstract: We propose Strategy-aware Surprise (SuS), a novel intrinsic motivation framework that uses pre-post prediction mismatch as a novelty signal for exploration in reinforcement learning. Unlike traditional curiosity-driven methods that rely solely on state prediction error, SuS introduces two complementary components: Strategy Stability (SS) and Strategy Surprise (SuS). SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. We evaluate SuS on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of our approach. SuS achieves 17.4% improvement in Pass@1 and 26.4% improvement in Pass@5 compared to baseline methods, while maintaining higher strategy diversity throughout training.

*Mesut Ceylan,Alexis Tabin,Patrick Langer,Elgar Fleisch,Filipe Barata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoMorph, an evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible counterfactual explanations (CFE) for time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models using PPG signals, enhancing clinical trust and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicians need reliable predictions and interpretable insights from wearable device data, especially for physiological signals like PPG. Current CFE methods lack physiological plausibility and focus primarily on classification, limiting their clinical applicability.

Method: The authors propose EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework that optimizes morphology-aware objectives and preserves waveform structure to generate plausible CFEs for TSER models.

Result: EvoMorph outperformed a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline across three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation) and demonstrated utility in uncertainty quantification through sensitivity analysis.

Conclusion: EvoMorph advances trustworthy model analysis by producing physiologically plausible CFEs and supporting uncertainty-aware interpretability for clinical time-series applications.

Abstract: Wearable devices enable continuous, population-scale monitoring of physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), creating new opportunities for data-driven clinical assessment. Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these "what-if" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.

*Jay Nandy,Arnab Kumar Mondal,Anuj Rathore,Mahesh Chandran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLGC introduces a self-supervised graph condensation method that avoids reliance on clean labels, leveraging latent pseudo-labels for robust performance under label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph condensation methods depend on clean supervised labels, limiting their reliability when labels are scarce or noisy.

Method: PLGC constructs pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match structural and feature statistics without ground-truth labels.

Result: PLGC performs competitively with supervised methods on clean datasets and excels under label noise.

Conclusion: PLGC demonstrates the advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled settings.

Abstract: Large graph datasets make training graph neural networks (GNNs) computationally costly. Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.

*Yuanjie Zhao,Junnan Qiu,Yue Ding,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CS-GBA, a stealthy and destructive backdoor attack for offline RL focusing on critical samples and avoiding detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerabilities of offline RL to backdoor attacks, especially against safety-constrained algorithms like CQL, by improving stealthiness and efficiency under limited budgets.

Method: Uses Critical Sample Selection to target high TD-error samples, Correlation-Breaking Trigger for stealth, and Gradient-Guided Action Generation for worst-case actions.

Result: Outperforms baselines with high attack success rates and minimal 5% poisoning budget while preserving clean environment performance.

Conclusion: CS-GBA is effective and stealthy, demonstrating significant improvements over existing backdoor attack methods in offline RL.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy optimization from static datasets but is inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates against representative safety-constrained algorithms with a minimal 5% poisoning budget, while maintaining the agent's performance in clean environments.

*Nadav Merlis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores tabular reinforcement learning with multi-step lookahead, introduces adaptive batching policies (ABPs) to address limitations of existing heuristics, and provides an optimal regret-minimizing algorithm for unknown environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches like fixed batching policies and model predictive control have limitations in leveraging lookahead information optimally. The study aims to improve policy effectiveness by adapting batch sizes dynamically.

Method: The proposed adaptive batching policies (ABPs) use state-dependent batches. The study derives optimal Bellman equations for ABPs and designs an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm for learning in unknown environments.

Result: The regret bounds achieved are order-optimal, scaling up only by a small factor related to the lookahead horizon, making ABPs practical for real-world applications.

Conclusion: Adaptive batching policies offer a superior alternative to fixed batching and model predictive control, with theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency.

Abstract: We study tabular reinforcement learning problems with multiple steps of lookahead information. Before acting, the learner observes $\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments. Our regret bounds are order-optimal up to a potential factor of the lookahead horizon $\ell$, which can usually be considered a small constant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges of optimizing generative policies without sacrificing iterative generation capability.

Method: Learns a lightweight refinement module within a data-derived trust region of the flow manifold, bypassing solver differentiation.

Result: Achieves superior performance on OGBench and demonstrates efficient offline-to-online adaptation.

Conclusion: DeFlow offers stable improvement and preserves flow expressivity while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: We present DeFlow, a decoupled offline RL framework that leverages flow matching to faithfully capture complex behavior manifolds. Optimizing generative policies is computationally prohibitive, typically necessitating backpropagation through ODE solvers. We address this by learning a lightweight refinement module within an explicit, data-derived trust region of the flow manifold, rather than sacrificing the iterative generation capability via single-step distillation. This way, we bypass solver differentiation and eliminate the need for balancing loss terms, ensuring stable improvement while fully preserving the flow's iterative expressivity. Empirically, DeFlow achieves superior performance on the challenging OGBench benchmark and demonstrates efficient offline-to-online adaptation.

TL;DR: GradESTC reduces communication overhead in federated learning by leveraging spatial and temporal correlations in gradients, cutting uplink communication by 39.79% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of communication overhead in federated learning, exacerbated in bandwidth-constrained networks, by focusing on unexplored temporal correlations alongside spatial correlations in gradients.

Method: Proposes GradESTC, a compression technique that decomposes gradients into basis vectors and combination coefficients, updating only a subset of basis vectors dynamically per round to reduce transmitted data.

Result: Achieves a 39.79% average reduction in uplink communication compared to top baselines, with comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed methods.

Conclusion: GradESTC is a practical, scalable solution for efficient federated learning by effectively utilizing spatio-temporal gradient structures.

Abstract: Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.

Motivation: The paper aims to improve large language model fine-tuning by addressing instability issues in policy updates, avoiding entropy collapse, and eliminating dependencies on reference policies or clipping.

Method: PROMA projects sequence-wise gradient components layer-wise during backward passes, accumulating gradients across microbatches without extra computational overhead.

Result: PROMA provides tighter control of local KL divergence compared to GRPO, leading to more stable policy learning without entropy collapse or reliance on reference policies.

Conclusion: PROMA is an efficient and effective method for proximal policy updates in language model fine-tuning, offering stability without additional computational cost.

Abstract: This note introduces Projected Microbatch Accumulation (PROMA), a proximal policy update method for large language model fine-tuning. PROMA accumulates policy gradients across microbatches by projecting out sequence-wise gradient components before microbatch aggregation. The projection is applied layer-wise during the backward pass, enabling efficient implementation without additional forward or backward passes. Empirically, PROMA enforces tighter control of local KL divergence than GRPO, resulting in more stable policy learning. Unlike PPO and GRPO, PROMA achieves proximal updates without inducing entropy collapse and does not rely on a reference policy or likelihood-ratio clipping.

Motivation: To enhance spectral efficiency, robustness, and security in Cognitive Radio systems by leveraging machine learning, specifically Transformer models.

Method: Training a GPT-2 model on existing modulation formulas to generate novel modulation schemes and comparing their performance using SNR and PSD metrics.

Result: Transformer-generated modulation schemes perform comparably or better than traditional methods.

Conclusion: Transformer models like GPT-2 can significantly improve Cognitive Radio systems, making them more efficient, robust, and secure.

Abstract: Cognitive Radio (CR) systems, which dynamically adapt to changing spectrum environments, could benefit significantly from advancements in machine learning technologies. These systems can be enhanced in terms of spectral efficiency, robustness, and security through innovative approaches such as the use of Transformer models. This work investigates the application of Transformer models, specifically the GPT-2 architecture, to generate novel modulation schemes for wireless communications. By training a GPT-2 model on a dataset of existing modulation formulas, new modulation schemes has been created. These generated schemes are then compared to traditional methods using key performance metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Power Spectrum Density (PSD). The results show that Transformer-generated modulation schemes can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases outperforming, traditional methods. This demonstrates that advanced CR systems could greatly benefit from the implementation of Transformer models, leading to more efficient, robust, and secure communication systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mixture of transparent local models to enhance interpretability in machine learning, particularly where simple functions suffice locally but vary abruptly across regions. It introduces a learning algorithm for these models and validates it with synthetic and real datasets, showing competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing need for transparency in machine learning models, ensuring factors like security and non-discrimination can be discerned.

Method: The method involves learning transparent labeling functions and their localities using a multi-predictor loss function, with rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for binary linear classification and linear regression.

Result: Results demonstrate the approach's effectiveness on synthetic datasets and competitiveness with existing methods on real datasets.

Conclusion: The conclusion underscores the viability of mixtures of transparent local models as interpretable alternatives to opaque models.

Abstract: The predominance of machine learning models in many spheres of human activity has led to a growing demand for their transparency. The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work. The results obtained from real data sets highlight the competitiveness of our approach compared to other existing methods as well as certain opaque models. Keywords: PAC-Bayes, risk bounds, local models, transparent models, mixtures of local transparent models.

However, standard CBMs often overlook domain-specific relationships and causal mechanisms, and their dependence on complete concept labels limits applicability in scientific domains where supervision is sparse but processes are well defined. To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs. Beyond improved accuracy, PG-CBM enhances transparency, enables detection of spurious learning, and provides scientific insights, representing a step toward more trustworthy AI systems in scientific applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare KANs and MLPs for solving computational challenges, emphasizing KANs' potential due to their adaptive spline-based functions and efficiency.

Method: Utilized datasets for function estimation, temperature prediction, and wine classification, assessing performance via MSE and FLOPs.

Result: KANs consistently outperformed MLPs, achieving higher accuracy with lower computational costs.

Conclusion: KANs offer a balanced, efficient, and accurate alternative to MLPs, especially in resource-limited or real-time applications.

Abstract: The research undertakes a comprehensive comparative analysis of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), highlighting their effectiveness in solving essential computational challenges like nonlinear function approximation, time-series prediction, and multivariate classification. Rooted in Kolmogorov's representation theorem, KANs utilize adaptive spline-based activation functions and grid-based structures, providing a transformative approach compared to traditional neural network frameworks. Utilizing a variety of datasets spanning mathematical function estimation (quadratic and cubic) to practical uses like predicting daily temperatures and categorizing wines, the proposed research thoroughly assesses model performance via accuracy measures like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and computational expense assessed through Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). The results indicate that KANs reliably exceed MLPs in every benchmark, attaining higher predictive accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs. Such an outcome highlights their ability to maintain a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, rendering them especially beneficial in resource-limited and real-time operational environments. By elucidating the architectural and functional distinctions between KANs and MLPs, the paper provides a systematic framework for selecting the most suitable neural architectures for specific tasks. Furthermore, the proposed study highlights the transformative capabilities of KANs in progressing intelligent systems, influencing their use in situations that require both interpretability and computational efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge machine learning, operations research, and stochastic optimization by integrating combinatorial optimization into learning pipelines for better decision-making.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a tutorial and roadmap for future research in COAML, identifying key frontiers in the field.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization augmented machine learning (COAML) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for integrating predictive models with combinatorial decision-making. By embedding combinatorial optimization oracles into learning pipelines, COAML enables the construction of policies that are both data-driven and feasibility-preserving, bridging the traditions of machine learning, operations research, and stochastic optimization. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in COAML. We introduce a unifying framework for COAML pipelines, describe their methodological building blocks, and formalize their connection to empirical cost minimization. We then develop a taxonomy of problem settings based on the form of uncertainty and decision structure. Using this taxonomy, we review algorithmic approaches for static and dynamic problems, survey applications across domains such as scheduling, vehicle routing, stochastic programming, and reinforcement learning, and synthesize methodological contributions in terms of empirical cost minimization, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning. Finally, we identify key research frontiers. This survey aims to serve both as a tutorial introduction to the field and as a roadmap for future research at the interface of combinatorial optimization and machine learning.

*Arundeep Chinta,Lucas Vinh Tran,Jay Katukuri*

TL;DR: ProbFM introduces a transformer-based probabilistic framework using Deep Evidential Regression (DER) for principled uncertainty decomposition in financial forecasting, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) lack theoretically-grounded uncertainty quantification, hindering their adoption in financial applications.

Method: ProbFM leverages DER for epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition, avoiding restrictive assumptions and sampling-based inference while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: DER achieves competitive forecasting accuracy and explicit uncertainty decomposition in cryptocurrency return forecasting, outperforming Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction.

Conclusion: ProbFM provides an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in TSFMs, demonstrating DER's effectiveness in financial forecasting.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A single-stage Huffman encoder with fixed codebooks is proposed to reduce overheads in LLMs, achieving near-ideal compression with minimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the latency and computational overheads of traditional Huffman coding in LLMs by leveraging statistical similarity across layers and shards.

Method: Using fixed codebooks derived from average probability distributions of previous batches, eliminating multi-stage processes.

Result: Achieves compression within 0.5% of per-shard Huffman coding and 1% of ideal Shannon compressibility.

Conclusion: The method enables efficient on-the-fly compression, beneficial for latency-sensitive scenarios like die-to-die communication.

Abstract: Training and serving Large Language Models (LLMs) require partitioning data across multiple accelerators, where collective operations are frequently bottlenecked by network bandwidth. Lossless compression using Huffman codes is an effective way to alleviate the issue, however, its three-stage design requiring on-the-fly frequency analysis, codebook generation and transmission of codebook along with data introduces computational, latency and data overheads which are prohibitive for latency-sensitive scenarios such as die-to-die communication. This paper proposes a single-stage Huffman encoder that eliminates these overheads by using fixed codebooks derived from the average probability distribution of previous data batches. Through our analysis of the Gemma 2B model, we demonstrate that tensors exhibit high statistical similarity across layers and shards. Using this approach we achieve compression within 0.5% of per-shard Huffman coding and within 1% of the ideal Shannon compressibility, enabling efficient on-the-fly compression.

### [208] [On the origin of neural scaling laws: from random graphs to natural language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10684)
*Maissam Barkeshli,Alberto Alfarano,Andrey Gromov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores neural scaling laws in transformers trained on random walks and simplified language models, showing these laws emerge even without power law data. It compares scaling exponents across different graph complexities and revisits conventional language scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the origin of neural scaling laws is crucial for AI advancement. The study aims to determine if scaling laws arise from inherent data power laws or broader mechanisms.

Method: Transformers are trained on random walks (bigrams) on graphs of varying complexity and simplified language models (from 4-layer transformers down to bigrams). Scaling laws are analyzed for Erdös-Renyi and Barabási-Albert graph ensembles. Conventional language scaling laws are revisited using 2-layer transformers.

Result: Neural scaling laws emerge even without power law data correlations. Scaling exponents evolve monotonically with language model simplification. Alternative methods for compute-optimal curves and parameter efficiency are demonstrated.

Conclusion: Scaling laws are not solely tied to power law data structure but arise in simpler settings. Simplified models can reproduce key scaling results, suggesting broader applicability of scaling principles.

Abstract: Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erdös-Renyi and scale-free Barabási-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a data-driven framework for learning efficient, stochastic reduced-order models (ROMs) that generalize across parameters and forcings, addressing computational and uncertainty challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of current ROMs, which struggle with stochastic dynamics and lack uncertainty quantification, hindering their use in robust decision-making.

Method: They propose a framework using amortized stochastic variational inference and a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to learn probabilistic autoencoders and stochastic differential equations efficiently.

Result: Their approach demonstrates excellent generalization to unseen conditions and achieves significant efficiency gains in numerical studies.

Conclusion: The introduced framework provides a scalable and flexible solution for modeling complex dynamical systems with stochastic dynamics and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Modeling complex dynamical systems under varying conditions is computationally intensive, often rendering high-fidelity simulations intractable. Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available. Numerical studies are presented for three challenging test problems, where we demonstrate excellent generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: CEPAM improves federated learning by balancing communication efficiency and privacy protection using RSUQ, with theoretical and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address communication efficiency and privacy protection challenges in federated learning.

Method: CEPAM utilizes RSUQ for customizable noise-based privacy and analyzes its privacy and convergence.

Result: CEPAM achieves efficient communication and adaptable privacy, validated by theoretical and experimental results.

Conclusion: CEPAM is effective for federated learning, balancing privacy and efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple parties to jointly train learning models without sharing their own underlying data, offering a practical pathway to privacy-preserving collaboration under data-governance constraints. Continued study of federated learning is essential to address key challenges in it, including communication efficiency and privacy protection between parties. A recent line of work introduced a novel approach called the Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Adaptable Mechanism (CEPAM), which achieves both objectives simultaneously. CEPAM leverages the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ), a randomized vector quantizer whose quantization error is equivalent to a prescribed noise, which can be tuned to customize privacy protection between parties. In this work, we theoretically analyze the privacy guarantees and convergence properties of CEPAM. Moreover, we assess CEPAM's utility performance through experimental evaluations, including convergence profiles compared with other baselines, and accuracy-privacy trade-offs between different parties.

*Keval Jain,Anant Raj,Saurav Prakash,Girish Varma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies a semi-asynchronous client-server perceptron trained via iterative parameter mixing, addressing system effects like stale updates, partial participation, and imperfect communication. It introduces a server-side aggregation rule and provides theoretical guarantees on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the impact of system effects (stale updates, partial participation, noisy communication) in federated and distributed deployments and develop a robust aggregation method for such settings.

Method: Proposes staleness-bucket aggregation with padding to handle stale updates deterministically, without assuming stochastic delay models. Analyzes performance under margin separability and bounded data radius.

Result: Proves a finite-horizon expected bound on perceptron mistakes, with delay impact through mean staleness and communication noise adding a term growing with the square root of horizon and noise energy. Shows finite-round stabilization in noiseless cases.

Conclusion: The proposed aggregation method effectively mitigates system effects, with theoretical guarantees on performance under realistic conditions.

Abstract: We study a semi-asynchronous client-server perceptron trained via iterative parameter mixing (IPM-style averaging): clients run local perceptron updates and a server forms a global model by aggregating the updates that arrive in each communication round. The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.

*Khashayar Gatmiry,Sitan Chen,Adil Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new solver for diffusion models that achieves high-accuracy sampling with polylogarithmic iteration complexity in inverse accuracy, improving over previous polynomial bounds, and scales with the effective radius of the target distribution rather than the ambient dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitation of current diffusion model solvers, which require many small iterations for high-quality sampling and scale polynomially with dimension and inverse accuracy.

Method: The method combines low-degree approximation with the collocation method to devise a new solver, leveraging approximate access to the scores of the data distribution.

Result: The solver’s iteration complexity scales polylogarithmically in inverse accuracy and depends on the effective radius of the target distribution rather than explicit ambient dimension.

Conclusion: The work presents a significant improvement in diffusion model sampling efficiency, offering theoretical guarantees for high-accuracy results with reduced computational burden.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in sampling from rich multi-modal distributions. Their inference relies on numerically solving a certain differential equation. This differential equation cannot be solved in closed form, and its resolution via discretization typically requires many small iterations to produce \emph{high-quality} samples.
  More precisely, prior works have shown that the iteration complexity of discretization methods for diffusion models scales polynomially in the ambient dimension and the inverse accuracy $1/\varepsilon$. In this work, we propose a new solver for diffusion models relying on a subtle interplay between low-degree approximation and the collocation method (Lee, Song, Vempala 2018), and we prove that its iteration complexity scales \emph{polylogarithmically} in $1/\varepsilon$, yielding the first ``high-accuracy'' guarantee for a diffusion-based sampler that only uses (approximate) access to the scores of the data distribution. In addition, our bound does not depend explicitly on the ambient dimension; more precisely, the dimension affects the complexity of our solver through the \emph{effective radius} of the support of the target distribution only.

TL;DR: DInf-Grid, a novel differentiable grid-based representation using radial basis function interpolation, efficiently solves differential equations with faster training and computation compared to traditional MLP-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural solvers like coordinate-based MLPs are slow and computationally intensive. Grid-based alternatives lack the ability to compute higher-order derivatives, limiting their use for solving differential equations.

Method: Combines feature grids with radial basis function interpolation for infinite differentiability. Introduces multi-resolution decomposition for high-frequency solutions and stable gradient computation. Trains implicitly using differential equations as loss functions.

Result: Achieves 5-20x speed-up over MLP-based methods, solving differential equations in seconds or minutes while maintaining accuracy and compactness.

Conclusion: DInf-Grid offers a faster, efficient alternative for solving differential equations, validated across various tasks like image reconstruction, wave fields, and cloth simulation.

Abstract: We present a novel differentiable grid-based representation for efficiently solving differential equations (DEs). Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation. Our results demonstrate a 5-20x speed-up over coordinate-based MLP-based methods, solving differential equations in seconds or minutes while maintaining comparable accuracy and compactness.

*Herman Cappelen,Simon Goldstein,John Hawthorne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes existential risks from AI by evaluating two premises: AI's extreme power potential and its potential threat to humanity. It proposes survival scenarios where one premise fails, discusses challenges, and estimates 'P(doom).'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess and categorize existential risks posed by AI, providing actionable insights for mitigating threats.

Method: Develops a framework based on two premises, constructs survival scenarios where one premise fails, and analyzes challenges and responses.

Result: Identifies various survival stories, outlines their unique challenges, and offers rough estimates for the probability of AI-caused human extinction ('P(doom)').

Conclusion: Different survival scenarios require tailored responses to AI threats, and understanding these helps in estimating and mitigating existential risks.

Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT, there has been a lot of debate about whether AI systems pose an existential risk to humanity. This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.

*Chen Chen,Jiawei Shao,Dakuan Lu,Haoyi Hu,Xiangcheng Liu,Hantao Yao,Wu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-Eyes is an RL framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks, using strategic tool invocation and a progressive perception strategy to outperform baselines with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI automation methods lack adaptive visual perception, relying on static inputs. GUI-Eyes addresses this by enabling active decision-making on observations.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage reasoning process (coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding) and a spatially continuous reward function for tool usage.

Result: On ScreenSpot-Pro, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy with only 3k labeled samples, surpassing supervised and RL baselines.

Conclusion: Tool-aware active perception, staged policy reasoning, and fine-grained rewards are key to robust, data-efficient GUI agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) have driven progress in GUI automation. However, most existing methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. We present GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks. To acquire more informative observations, the agent learns to make strategic decisions on both whether and how to invoke visual tools, such as cropping or zooming, within a two-stage reasoning process. To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines. These results highlight that tool-aware active perception, enabled by staged policy reasoning and fine-grained reward feedback, is critical for building robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

*Paweł Niszczota,Cassandra Grützner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study reveals that people are willing to spend their own money to punish peers who use large language models (LLMs), with punishment increasing with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use creates skepticism, especially for claims of no use, and efficiency gains from LLMs come with social sanctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand whether negative attitudes toward AI users translate into costly punitive actions, addressing a gap in prior work.

Method: A two-phase online experiment involved 491 participants in Phase II. Participants could spend part of their endowment to reduce earnings of peers who completed a task with or without LLM support.

Result: Participants destroyed 36% of earnings of those who relied exclusively on LLMs, with punishment increasing with actual LLM use. Disclosure led to skepticism, with self-reported null use punished more than actual null use.

Conclusion: The study provides the first behavioral evidence that LLM efficiency gains incur social sanctions, highlighting a credibility gap in disclosures about LLM use.

Abstract: The rapid spread of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the social reactions they provoke. Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of "no use" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance. Taken together, these findings provide the first behavioral evidence that the efficiency gains of LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a non-interactive, end-to-end framework (AAI) that enhances LLMs' logical reasoning by modulating attention heads, improving performance without external resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for logical reasoning rely on interactive or hybrid frameworks, which introduce overhead or scalability issues. The goal is to enable reasoning within the model itself.

Method: The proposed Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI) reweights attention scores in selected heads, identified by logical patterns, to steer reasoning.

Result: AAI improves reasoning performance across benchmarks and architectures with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: AAI offers a scalable and efficient solution for emergent logical reasoning in LLMs without external dependencies.

Abstract: Modern logical reasoning with LLMs primarily relies on employing complex interactive frameworks that decompose the reasoning process into subtasks solved through carefully designed prompts or requiring external resources (e.g., symbolic solvers) to exploit their strong logical structures. While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

TL;DR: Min-Seek improves model accuracy and stability in sequential test-time scaling without needing fine-tuning, while being efficient and extending reasoning beyond context limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address accuracy degradation and instability in sequential test-time scaling methods when extending reasoning length.

Method: Introduces Min-Seek, a novel method that keeps only one additional induced thought's KV pairs in the cache, uses a custom KV cache without position embeddings, and dynamically encodes keys contiguously.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy across reasoning tasks, stabilizes scaling, avoids reasoning length fine-tuning, and maintains efficiency with linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: Min-Seek effectively overcomes limitations of sequential test-time scaling, enhancing accuracy and stability while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Sequential test-time scaling is a promising training-free method to improve large reasoning model accuracy, but as currently implemented, significant limitations have been observed. Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.

Result: Findings show convergence on attribution-based definitions but divergence in operationalization, predominantly risk-focused normative framing, and limited empirical links to governance.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based CAs.

Abstract: Anthropomorphisation -- the phenomenon whereby non-human entities are ascribed human-like qualities -- has become increasingly salient with the rise of large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents (CAs). Unlike earlier chatbots, LLM-based CAs routinely generate interactional and linguistic cues, such as first-person self-reference, epistemic and affective expressions that empirical work shows can increase engagement. On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches. We find convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work that links observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents.

### [220] [Epistemology gives a Future to Complementarity in Human-AI Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09871)
*Andrea Ferrario,Alessandro Facchini,Juan M. Durán*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in human-AI complementarity by reframing it within epistemic reliability, arguing it helps calibrate decision-making reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address theoretical gaps and practical difficulties in achieving human-AI complementarity by grounding it in epistemic reliability.

Method: Leverages epistemology and computational reliabilism to analyze complementarity as evidence of reliable epistemic processes in human-AI teams.

Result: Complementarity is recast as a tool for calibrating reliability in AI-supported decision-making, not just predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Complementarity's value lies in enhancing the reliability of human-AI processes, aiding practical reasoning for decision-makers.

Abstract: Human-AI complementarity is the claim that a human supported by an AI system can outperform either alone in a decision-making process. Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.

*Yizhan Li,Florence Cloutier,Sifan Wu,Ali Parviz,Boris Knyazev,Yan Zhang,Glen Berseth,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M olGen is a two-stage framework for generating molecules under multi-property constraints, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning and RL-based optimization to achieve precise control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLMs struggle with precise multi-objective molecule generation, necessitating a structured approach for better numeric reasoning and control.

Method: Stage I involves multi-agent retrieval-anchored fragment edits to create prototypes; Stage II uses RL-based optimization (GRPO) for fine-grained refinements toward target properties.

Result: M olGen outperforms LLMs and graph-based methods in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight, HOMO, LUMO).

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines fragment-level reasoning with RL optimization for accurate molecule generation under complex constraints.

Abstract: Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.

### [222] [Beyond Rule-Based Workflows: An Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agents Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent Communication from CORAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09883)
*Xinxing Ren,Quagmire Zang,Caelum Forder,Suman Deb,Ahsen Tahir,Roman J. Georgio,Peter Carroll,Zekun Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic multi-agent system (MAS) paradigm that avoids predefined workflows, using natural language coordination instead, and outperforms traditional rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based MAS rely on predefined workflows, which are labor-intensive and insufficient for complex tasks. The goal is to propose a more flexible and scalable solution.

Method: The authors propose an information-flow-orchestrated MAS via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication, eliminating predefined workflows and using natural language coordination.

Result: The method achieves 63.64% accuracy on the GAIA benchmark, outperforming the baseline OWL system (55.15%) by 8.49 percentage points.

Conclusion: The dynamic coordination paradigm is more flexible and robust, offering better performance without relying on manual workflow design.

Abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) rely on predefined workflows, where human engineers enumerate task states in advance and specify routing rules and contextual injections accordingly. Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes studying LLM-based agent collectives due to their societal impact, proposing an interactionist paradigm for systematic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLM-based collective behavior is crucial due to societal risks and benefits, driven by their pre-trained knowledge and adaptability.

Method: Proposes an interactionist paradigm with new theories, methods, and tools to examine LLM interactions in social contexts.

Result: Identifies four key directions for advancing LLM-based collectives, focusing on theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary collaboration.

Conclusion: Systematic study of LLM collectives requires innovative approaches to address their societal implications.

Abstract: In this article, we argue that understanding the collective behavior of agents based on large language models (LLMs) is an essential area of inquiry, with important implications in terms of risks and benefits, impacting us as a society at many levels. We claim that the distinctive nature of LLMs--namely, their initialization with extensive pre-trained knowledge and implicit social priors, together with their capability of adaptation through in-context learning--motivates the need for an interactionist paradigm consisting of alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools, in order to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context to shape emergent phenomena in multi-agent generative AI systems. We propose and discuss four directions that we consider crucial for the development and deployment of LLM-based collectives, focusing on theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogue.

### [224] [Continuum Memory Architectures for Long-Horizon LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09913)
*Joe Logan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continuum Memory Architecture (CMA) to address limitations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by enabling dynamic memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods treat memory statically, lacking temporal continuity and dynamic updates, which limits long-horizon agent performance.

Method: CMA incorporates persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation for dynamic memory management.

Result: CMA outperforms RAG in tasks requiring memory accumulation, mutation, or disambiguation, proving its necessity for long-horizon agents.

Conclusion: CMA is a crucial advancement for agent memory but faces challenges like latency, drift, and interpretability.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the default strategy for providing large language model (LLM) agents with contextual knowledge. Yet RAG treats memory as a stateless lookup table: information persists indefinitely, retrieval is read-only, and temporal continuity is absent. We define the \textit{Continuum Memory Architecture} (CMA), a class of systems that maintain and update internal state across interactions through persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation into higher-order abstractions. Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory. The empirical probes (knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, contextual disambiguation) demonstrate that CMA is a necessary architectural primitive for long-horizon agents while highlighting open challenges around latency, drift, and interpretability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, and while architectural isolation is a robust defense, it conflicts with the needs of Computer Use Agents (CUAs). The paper introduces Single-Shot Planning to resolve this, ensuring security without compromising utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of AI agents to prompt injection attacks, particularly in CUAs, where traditional security measures conflict with operational requirements.

Method: Introduces Single-Shot Planning, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before observing untrusted content, ensuring control flow integrity.

Result: The method prevents instruction injections and improves security, though additional measures are needed to counter Branch Steering attacks. Evaluation shows retained performance for frontier models and gains for smaller models.

Conclusion: Rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs, as demonstrated by the successful implementation of Single-Shot Planning and its evaluation on OSWorld.

Abstract: AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious content hijacks agent behavior to steal credentials or cause financial loss. The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan. We evaluate our design on OSWorld, and retain up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19%, demonstrating that rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to manage hallucinations (factual inaccuracies) in LLMs and LRMs by categorizing their sources and applying targeted interventions to enhance reliability in high-stakes domains like finance and law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical reliability risks posed by hallucinations in large language and reasoning models, especially in high-stakes domains where accuracy is paramount.

Method: The framework categorizes hallucination sources (model, data, context) and integrates multi-faceted detection methods with stratified mitigation strategies, demonstrated through a tiered architecture and financial case study.

Result: The approach provides a systematic, scalable methodology for improving the reliability of generative AI in regulated environments.

Conclusion: The framework offers a structured solution to manage and mitigate hallucinations, enhancing trustworthiness in AI applications for critical domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) offer transformative potential for high-stakes domains like finance and law, but their tendency to hallucinate, generating factually incorrect or unsupported content, poses a critical reliability risk. This paper introduces a comprehensive operational framework for hallucination management, built on a continuous improvement cycle driven by root cause awareness. We categorize hallucination sources into model, data, and context-related factors, allowing targeted interventions over generic fixes. The framework integrates multi-faceted detection methods (e.g., uncertainty estimation, reasoning consistency) with stratified mitigation strategies (e.g., knowledge grounding, confidence calibration). We demonstrate its application through a tiered architecture and a financial data extraction case study, where model, context, and data tiers form a closed feedback loop for progressive reliability enhancement. This approach provides a systematic, scalable methodology for building trustworthy generative AI systems in regulated environments.

TL;DR: LabourLawLLM is a specialized LLM for Chinese labor law, outperforming general-purpose models like GPT-4 and existing legal LLMs, validated by LabourLawBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs struggle with specialized legal tasks requiring precision, reasoning, and contextual awareness, necessitating domain-specific models.

Method: Developed LabourLawLLM tailored to Chinese labor law and introduced LabourLawBench, a benchmark covering diverse legal tasks. Evaluation combined objective metrics and GPT-4 scoring.

Result: LabourLawLLM consistently outperformed general-purpose and existing legal-specific LLMs across task categories.

Conclusion: The methodology offers a scalable approach for specialized LLMs in legal subfields, enhancing AI applications' accuracy, reliability, and societal impact.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in domain-specific applications, particularly within the legal domain. However, general-purpose models such as GPT-4 often struggle with specialized subdomains that require precise legal knowledge, complex reasoning, and contextual sensitivity. To address these limitations, we present LabourLawLLM, a legal large language model tailored to Chinese labor law. We also introduce LabourLawBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse labor-law tasks, including legal provision citation, knowledge-based question answering, case classification, compensation computation, named entity recognition, and legal case analysis. Our evaluation framework combines objective metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L, accuracy, F1, and soft-F1) with subjective assessment based on GPT-4 scoring. Experiments show that LabourLawLLM consistently outperforms general-purpose and existing legal-specific LLMs across task categories. Beyond labor law, our methodology provides a scalable approach for building specialized LLMs in other legal subfields, improving accuracy, reliability, and societal value of legal AI applications.

### [228] [SPRInG: Continual LLM Personalization via Selective Parametric Adaptation and Retrieval-Interpolated Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09974)
*Seoyeon Kim,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPRInG is a new framework for continual personalization of LLMs, addressing dynamic user preferences by selectively adapting to drift signals while preserving residuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User preferences evolve dynamically, but current methods assume static preferences or fail to handle drift without catastrophic forgetting.

Method: SPRInG uses drift-driven selective adaptation with likelihood-based scoring to identify novelty and a replay buffer for residuals. Inference combines retrieved history via logit interpolation.

Result: Experiments show SPRInG outperforms baselines on long-form personalized generation, proving its robustness.

Conclusion: SPRInG effectively handles continual personalization by balancing adaptation and preservation, suitable for real-world dynamic preferences.

Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Models typically relies on static retrieval or one-time adaptation, assuming user preferences remain invariant over time. However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. This allows the model to selectively update the user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving hard-to-learn residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, we apply strict relevance gating and fuse parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation. Experiments on the long-form personalized generation benchmark demonstrate that SPRInG outperforms existing baselines, validating its robustness for real-world continual personalization.

*Zerui Yang,Weichuan Wang,Yanwei Xu,Linqi Song,Yudai Matsuda,Wei Han,Bo Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo-SQL introduces structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction to overcome limitations in NL2SQL systems, achieving high accuracy with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL2SQL systems lack robustness due to reliance on correct examples only and arbitrary question decomposition, leading to inefficiency and accuracy trade-offs.

Method: Memo-SQL uses structured decomposition (entity-wise, hierarchical, atomic sequential) and a dynamic memory of successful queries and error-fix pairs for self-correction via retrieval-augmented prompting.

Result: Memo-SQL achieves 68.5% execution accuracy on BIRD, outperforming other zero-fine-tuning methods while using significantly fewer resources.

Conclusion: Memo-SQL sets a new standard for efficient and accurate NL2SQL systems without requiring fine-tuning or external APIs.

Abstract: Existing NL2SQL systems face two critical limitations: (1) they rely on in-context learning with only correct examples, overlooking the rich signal in historical error-fix pairs that could guide more robust self-correction; and (2) test-time scaling approaches often decompose questions arbitrarily, producing near-identical SQL candidates across runs and diminishing ensemble gains. Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction. Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required. On BIRD, Memo-SQL achieves 68.5% execution accuracy, setting a new state of the art among open, zero-fine-tuning methods, while using over 10 times fewer resources than prior TTS approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether LLMs can exhibit human-like personality traits to enhance engagement and realism in HCI.

Method: Propose a framework using Jungian psychological types with three mechanisms: dominant-auxiliary coordination, reinforcement-compensation, and reflection for dynamic personality expression.

Result: LLMs with evolving personalities show coherent, context-sensitive interactions, validated via Myers-Briggs tests and challenge scenarios.

Conclusion: Evolving, personality-aware LLMs can improve naturalistic agent design in HCI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping human-computer interaction (HCI), from personalized assistants to social simulations. Beyond language competence, researchers are exploring whether LLMs can exhibit human-like characteristics that influence engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism. Personality, in particular, is critical, yet existing approaches often struggle to achieve both nuanced and adaptable expression. We present a framework that models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types, integrating three mechanisms: a dominant-auxiliary coordination mechanism for coherent core expression, a reinforcement-compensation mechanism for temporary adaptation to context, and a reflection mechanism that drives long-term personality evolution. This design allows the agent to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating its underlying structure. Personality alignment is evaluated using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires and tested under diverse challenge scenarios as a preliminary structured assessment. Findings suggest that evolving, personality-aware LLMs can support coherent, context-sensitive interactions, enabling naturalistic agent design in HCI.

TL;DR: The paper proposes PaperScout, an autonomous agent for academic paper search, addressing the limitations of rigid workflows by using sequential decision-making. It introduces Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO) to overcome granularity mismatch in training such agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing academic paper search methods rely on inflexible workflows, which struggle with complex queries. The authors aim to create a dynamic, adaptive solution.

Method: PaperScout, an autonomous agent, reformulates search as sequential decision-making. The authors introduce PSPO, a sequence-level policy optimization method for training such agents.

Result: PaperScout outperforms workflow-driven and RL baselines in recall and relevance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the adaptive framework and PSPO.

Conclusion: The adaptive agentic framework and PSPO optimization strategy significantly improve academic paper search, addressing the limitations of static workflows and traditional RL methods.

Abstract: Academic paper search is a fundamental task in scientific research, yet most existing approaches rely on rigid, predefined workflows that struggle with complex, conditional queries. To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods have limitations, and DL techniques require high-quality datasets, which are hard to obtain for large deformations. FilDeep addresses this by balancing data quantity and accuracy.

Method: FilDeep uses attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to capture long-range interactions across multi-fidelity (MF) data, training simultaneously with low-fidelity (high-quantity) and high-fidelity (high-accuracy) datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments show FilDeep achieves top-tier performance and efficient deployment in manufacturing applications.

Conclusion: FilDeep is a pioneering DL framework for large deformation problems, effectively resolving the data quantity-accuracy trade-off and advancing practical applications.

Abstract: The scientific computation of large deformations in elastic-plastic solids is crucial in various manufacturing applications. Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs are used in practice has lagged behind their rapid deployment and experimentation.

Method: Leveraging the OpenRouter platform, the study analyzes over 100 trillion tokens of LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time.

Result: Key findings include the popularity of open-weight models, creative roleplay, coding assistance, and the 'Cinderella Glass Slipper' effect highlighting persistent early users.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the complexity of LLM usage and suggests data-driven insights can improve design and deployment.

Abstract: The past year has marked a turning point in the evolution and real-world use of large language models (LLMs). With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella "Glass Slipper" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs "in the wild" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.

*Ke Chen,Jiandian Zeng,Zihao Peng,Guo Li,Guangxue Zhang,Tian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MatrixCoT improves LLMs' logical reasoning by introducing a structured CoT framework with matrix-based planning and feedback-driven replanning, enhancing robustness and interpretability without external solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT prompting and neuro-symbolic methods struggle with symbolic reasoning tasks due to brittleness or lack of structured representations, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: MatrixCoT normalizes and types natural language expressions, uses matrix-based planning to preserve step relations, and includes a feedback-driven replanning mechanism for verification.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show MatrixCoT enhances robustness and interpretability while maintaining competitive performance without external solvers.

Conclusion: MatrixCoT successfully addresses gaps in logical reasoning for LLMs, offering a more stable and interpretable framework.

Abstract: As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.

TL;DR: SCD and AW enable student models to outperform teachers by balancing deficits and advantages across subdomains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the capacity gap issue in distilling LLMs for domain tasks, ensuring students match or surpass teachers.

Method: Proposes Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD) and Adaptive Weighting (AW) to optimize student performance.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across QA, NER, and text classification tasks in multiple languages.

Conclusion: SCD and AW effectively bridge the gap, enabling students to excel in domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are challenging to deploy for domain-specific tasks due to their massive scale. While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS. Experiments across diverse domain tasks--including QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages--show that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, allowing the student model to match or even exceed the performance of its fine-tuned teacher.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs are tested for predicting time intervals between recurring user actions, like repurchases. They outperform basic stats models but lag behind dedicated ML models, and context helps only to a point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' ability to infer temporal patterns from structured behavioral data, a gap in current research.

Method: Benchmarking LLMs in zero-shot settings against statistical and ML models using repurchase scenarios with varying context levels.

Result: LLMs beat simple stats models but fall short of ML models; moderate context improves accuracy, but excessive context harms performance.

Conclusion: LLMs have limits in structured temporal inference; future models should blend statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning and prediction across different domains. Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that "more context leads to better reasoning". Our study highlights fundamental limitations of today's LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of concept drift and non-stationarity in quantitative finance, proposing a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates adaptive control into data curation for improved model robustness and market performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of adaptability in models trained on static historical data leads to poor generalization in dynamic markets, emphasizing the need for systems that evolve with the market.

Method: The system combines a parameterized data manipulation module (single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, curation) with an adaptive planner-scheduler using gradient-based bi-level optimization for control.

Result: Experiments on forecasting and trading tasks show enhanced model robustness and improved risk-adjusted returns.

Conclusion: The framework offers a generalizable solution for adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation in finance.

Abstract: In quantitative finance, the gap between training and real-world performance-driven by concept drift and distributional non-stationarity-remains a critical obstacle for building reliable data-driven systems. Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra "History Is Not Enough" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framework, enabling provenance-aware replay and continuous data quality monitoring. Extensive experiments on forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks demonstrate that our framework enhances model robustness and improves risk-adjusted returns. The system provides a generalizable approach to adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation for financial data.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for offline sequential decision-making, proposing DecisionLLM to align trajectory data with task descriptions, outperforming traditional methods in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is inspired by LLMs' success in reasoning tasks and their shared Transformer foundation with Decision Transformers (DTs), aiming to leverage LLMs for enhanced long-horizon decision-making.

Method: The authors treat trajectories as a unique modality, aligning them with natural language descriptions to enable autoregressive prediction of future decisions, forming DecisionLLM.

Result: DecisionLLM-3B outperforms DT by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet, showcasing the impact of model scale, data volume, and quality.

Conclusion: The work extends AIGB and highlights the potential of LLMs in online bidding and future decision-making research.

Abstract: Long-sequence decision-making, which is usually addressed through reinforcement learning (RL), is a critical component for optimizing strategic operations in dynamic environments, such as real-time bidding in computational advertising. The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. It extends the AIGB paradigm and points to promising directions for future exploration in online bidding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMPG enhances protein representation by constructing graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fusing them using Mixture of Experts, outperforming single-perspective methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based protein representation methods capture only partial properties of residue interactions due to single-perspective graph construction, limiting representation completeness.

Method: MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives, using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module to dynamically route and fuse these perspectives for comprehensive representation.

Result: MMPG achieves advanced performance on four downstream protein tasks, demonstrating superior protein representation through multi-level feature integration.

Conclusion: MMPG's multi-perspective and adaptive fusion approach significantly improves protein representation learning, addressing limitations of existing single-perspective methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for Protein Representation Learning (PRL), as residue interaction networks can be naturally represented as graphs. Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how artificial neural agents can mimic human compositional generalization for describing unseen images.

Method: Two-step training: 'Decompose' learns basic concepts via a codebook from a coordination game; 'Compose' uses the codebook to form complex phrases for novel images.

Result: Agents successfully generalize to describe new images, sometimes zero-shot.

Conclusion: The method effectively enables compositional generalization in neural agents, highlighting potential for zero-shot learning.

Abstract: Compositionality is a cognitive mechanism that allows humans to systematically combine known concepts in novel ways. This study demonstrates how artificial neural agents acquire and utilize compositional generalization to describe previously unseen images. Our method, termed "Composition through Decomposition", involves two sequential training steps. In the 'Decompose' step, the agents learn to decompose an image into basic concepts using a codebook acquired during interaction in a multi-target coordination game. Subsequently, in the 'Compose' step, the agents employ this codebook to describe novel images by composing basic concepts into complex phrases. Remarkably, we observe cases where generalization in the `Compose' step is achieved zero-shot, without the need for additional training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a workflow to evaluate information loss from downsampling high-frequency nEMG signals, balancing computational efficiency and diagnostic accuracy for neuromuscular disease detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high and varied sampling rates of nEMG signals challenge real-time machine-learning analysis, with downsampling's effects on diagnostic content and classification poorly understood.

Method: A workflow combining shape-based distortion metrics, classification outcomes, and feature space analysis evaluates downsampling's impact on waveform integrity and predictive performance in a three-class NMD task.

Result: Shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation by preserving peak structure and signal morphology, enabling effective real-time analysis.

Conclusion: The workflow offers practical guidance for downsampling configurations in nEMG analysis and is generalizable to other high-frequency time-series applications.

Abstract: Automated analysis of needle electromyography (nEMG) signals is emerging as a tool to support the detection of neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), yet the signals' high and heterogeneous sampling rates pose substantial computational challenges for feature-based machine-learning models, particularly for near real-time analysis. Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.

TL;DR: GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model, enhances group anomaly detection using dual-level contrastive learning and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group anomaly detection is challenging due to diverse patterns, and existing graph foundation models (GFMs) fail to generalize for group anomalies.

Method: Proposes GFM4GA, pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning and finetuned in few-shot settings using group contexts.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC over existing detectors.

Conclusion: GFM4GA effectively addresses group anomaly detection challenges and outperforms current methods.

Abstract: Group anomaly detection is crucial in many network applications, but faces challenges due to diverse anomaly patterns. Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors. Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.

TL;DR: Topo-RAG challenges the linearization approach in RAG systems by preserving data topology, improving search accuracy by 18.4% on hybrid queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems inadequately handle the complexity of enterprise datasets by linearizing structured data, which fails to capture spatial relationships.

Method: Topo-RAG uses a dual architecture: dense retrievers for narrative and Cell-Aware Late Interaction for tabular data, maintaining spatial relationships.

Result: Topo-RAG improves nDCG@10 by 18.4% on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization methods, tested on the SEC-25 corpus.

Conclusion: Topo-RAG demonstrates that preserving data topology enhances retrieval performance, emphasizing the need to understand information’s structure.

Abstract: In enterprise datasets, documents are rarely pure. They are not just text, nor just numbers; they are a complex amalgam of narrative and structure. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have attempted to address this complexity with a blunt tool: linearization. We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient.
  This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that "everything is text". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches. It's not just about searching better; it's about understanding the shape of information.

*Vansh Kapoor,Aman Gupta,Hao Chen,Anurag Beniwal,Jing Huang,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRIM is a targeted routing method for multi-step reasoning tasks that routes only critical steps to larger models, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM routing methods treat all reasoning steps equally, leading to inefficiencies and cascading failures in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Method: TRIM identifies critical steps using process reward models and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints, employing various routing strategies.

Result: TRIM outperforms prior methods with 5x higher cost efficiency on MATH-500 and achieves up to 6x higher efficiency on harder benchmarks like AIME, matching strong models' performance with fewer resources.

Conclusion: Step-level difficulty is fundamental in reasoning tasks, and TRIM's targeted interventions significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving are vulnerable to cascading failures, where a single incorrect step leads to complete solution breakdown. Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency. All methods generalize effectively across math reasoning tasks, demonstrating that step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning.

TL;DR: NoReGeo is a new benchmark evaluating LLMs' intrinsic geometric understanding without algebraic reasoning, revealing gaps even in advanced models like GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs inherently encode spatial relationships and geometric properties, bypassing reasoning-based methods.

Method: Created 2,500 trivial geometric problems across 25 categories, solvable through native geometric understanding alone, and tested state-of-the-art models.

Result: Advanced models achieved up to 65% accuracy, showing geometric understanding doesn't emerge from fine-tuning alone.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack native geometric cognition, necessitating specialized training approaches for improvement.

Abstract: We present NoReGeo, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the intrinsic geometric understanding of large language models (LLMs) without relying on reasoning or algebraic computation. Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily assess models' proficiency in reasoning-based geometry-where solutions are derived using algebraic methods-NoReGeo focuses on evaluating whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly. Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset. Our findings highlight a significant gap in current LLMs' ability to natively grasp geometric concepts, providing a foundation for future research toward models with true geometric cognition.

TL;DR: EAPO addresses RL's reward sparsity in long-context reasoning by introducing dense process supervision via Group-Relative Evidence Reward and adaptive co-evolution of reward and policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods struggle with sparse outcome rewards in long-context scenarios, leading to unsupervised evidence retrieval and ungrounded guesses.

Method: EAPO introduces Evidence-Augmented Reasoning, Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling, Group-Relative Evidence Reward, and Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution.

Result: EAPO outperforms SOTA baselines across eight benchmarks, improving long-context reasoning.

Conclusion: EAPO effectively tackles reward sparsity and enhances evidence quality, advancing long-context reasoning.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has advanced LLM reasoning, applying it to long-context scenarios is hindered by sparsity of outcome rewards. This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded "lucky guesses," leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance. Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to SOTA baselines.

TL;DR: C-GRASP, a method integrating LLMs with HRV interpretation, addresses physiological hallucinations through traceable reasoning steps and individualized baselines, achieving improved emotion classification and clinical reasoning consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HRV interpretation suffers from physiological hallucinations like RSA contamination and population bias, limiting accurate autonomic monitoring with LLMs.

Method: C-GRASP employs a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline with eight reasoning steps, a Z-score Priority Hierarchy, and automated RSA-aware guardrails to mitigate spectral hallucinations.

Result: Achieved 37.3% accuracy in 4-class emotion classification and a CRC score of 69.6% on the DREAMER dataset, outperforming native LLMs.

Conclusion: C-GRASP enhances HRV interpretation by prioritizing individualized baselines and transparent reasoning, enabling safer AI use in biomedical engineering.

Abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a pivotal noninvasive marker for autonomic monitoring; however, applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to HRV interpretation is hindered by physiological hallucinations. These include respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and the neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms. We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the "population bias" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.

TL;DR: LatentRefusal is a lightweight probing mechanism that predicts query answerability from LLM hidden activations, improving text-to-SQL safety with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unanswerable or underspecified queries in text-to-SQL systems can produce unsafe or incorrect outputs, highlighting the need for robust refusal strategies beyond brittle or complex existing methods.

Method: Proposes LatentRefusal, leveraging hidden activations of LLMs, and introduces Tri-Residual Gated Encoder to detect schema mismatches and suppress noise.

Result: Achieves 88.5% F1 across four benchmarks with only ~2ms probe overhead, demonstrating efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: LatentRefusal effectively enhances text-to-SQL safety by predictively refusing unanswerable queries, offering a scalable and attachable solution.

Abstract: In LLM-based text-to-SQL systems, unanswerable and underspecified user queries may generate not only incorrect text but also executable programs that yield misleading results or violate safety constraints, posing a major barrier to safe deployment. Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems. Across four benchmarks, LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5 percent on both backbones while adding approximately 2 milliseconds of probe overhead.

TL;DR: ML-Master 2.0 addresses ultra-long-horizon autonomy in AI by introducing Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), enabling coherent long-term strategy despite delayed feedback, achieving a 56.44% success rate on MLE-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of sustaining strategic coherence over long experimental cycles bottlenecks AI's agentic science potential, necessitating solutions like HCC.

Method: Proposes HCC, a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems, to dynamically distil execution traces into stable knowledge for long-term strategy.

Result: ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art 56.44% medal rate on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets.

Conclusion: Ultra-long-horizon autonomy, as demonstrated by ML-Master 2.0, offers a scalable model for AI autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.

### [251] [ErrEval: Error-Aware Evaluation for Question Generation through Explicit Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10406)
*Weiping Fu,Bifan Wei,Jingyi Hao,Yushun Zhang,Jian Zhang,Jiaxin Wang,Bo Li,Yu He,Lingling Zhang,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ErrEval, an error-aware framework for evaluating Automatic Question Generation (QG), addressing defects like factual hallucinations by incorporating explicit error diagnostics into the evaluation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QG evaluation methods overlook critical defects (e.g., factual hallucinations) due to their black-box and holistic approach, leading to overestimated question quality.

Method: ErrEval reformulates evaluation into a two-stage process: error diagnosis (using a plug-and-play Error Identifier) followed by informed scoring (incorporating diagnostic signals into LLM evaluators).

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks show ErrEval improves alignment with human judgments and mitigates overestimation of low-quality questions.

Conclusion: ErrEval enhances QG evaluation by explicitly diagnosing errors, leading to more accurate and fine-grained assessments.

Abstract: Automatic Question Generation (QG) often produces outputs with critical defects, such as factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.

*Haiyue Yuan,Nikolay Matyunin,Ali Raza,Shujun Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LADFA, a framework combining LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation, and a custom knowledge base to analyze privacy policies by extracting personal data flows and constructing graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy policies are often complex and hard to understand, necessitating automated tools for large-scale analysis.

Method: Combines LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a custom knowledge base to extract and analyze data flows from privacy policies.

Result: LADFA effectively processes privacy policies, extracts data flows, and constructs graphs, validated through a case study involving automotive industry policies.

Conclusion: LADFA is flexible and customizable, suitable for various text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policies.

Abstract: Privacy policies help inform people about organisations' personal data processing practices, covering different aspects such as data collection, data storage, and sharing of personal data with third parties. Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.

*Tiesunlong Shen,Rui Mao,Jin Wang,Heming Sun,Jian Zhang,Xuejie Zhang,Erik Cambria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMdoctor is a novel framework for efficiently aligning large language models with human preferences using a patient-doctor paradigm and token-level flow-guided preference optimization, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning methods for aligning LLMs with human preferences are computationally expensive and inflexible, prompting the need for a more efficient and effective test-time alignment approach.

Method: LLMdoctor uses a patient-doctor paradigm, extracting token-level preference signals from a large LLM (patient) and optimizing a smaller doctor model via token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO).

Result: LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and surpasses full fine-tuning approaches like DPO, while preserving generative diversity.

Conclusion: LLMdoctor offers an efficient, precise, and diversity-preserving solution for aligning LLMs with human preferences, surpassing traditional and existing test-time methods.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical, yet traditional fine-tuning methods are computationally expensive and inflexible. While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.

TL;DR: NSR-Boost is a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed to upgrade legacy GBDT models in high-concurrency industrial settings by non-intrusively repairing prediction failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prohibitive retraining costs and systemic risks of upgrading legacy GBDT models in industrial environments.

Method: Uses a three-stage framework: identifying hard regions via residuals, generating interpretable experts with LLMs and Bayesian optimization, and integrating outputs via a lightweight aggregator.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines on six public and one private dataset, with notable gains in real-world online performance.

Conclusion: Effectively captures long-tail risks and provides a safe, low-cost upgrade solution for industry.

Abstract: Although the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) dominate industrial tabular applications, upgrading legacy models in high-concurrency production environments still faces prohibitive retraining costs and systemic risks. To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being "non-intrusive". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on "hard regions" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for evaluating MLLMs in chart understanding are limited to few chart types, creating a gap in comprehensive performance measurement.

Method: Proposes ChartComplete, a dataset based on a visualization taxonomy, covering thirty chart types without including learning signals.

Result: ChartComplete provides a broader benchmark for MLLMs, enabling more comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: The dataset is presented to the community to advance chart understanding research.

In particular, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proving to be efficient and accurate in understanding charts. To accurately measure the performance of MLLMs, the research community has developed multiple datasets to serve as benchmarks. By examining these datasets, we found that they are all limited to a small set of chart types. To bridge this gap, we propose the ChartComplete dataset. The dataset is based on a chart taxonomy borrowed from the visualization community, and it covers thirty different chart types. The dataset is a collection of classified chart images and does not include a learning signal. We present the ChartComplete dataset as is to the community to build upon it.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DKGF task enriches domain-specific knowledge graphs (DKGs) by integrating facts from general knowledge graphs (GKGs), addressing ambiguity and misalignment. ExeFuse, a Fact-as-Program paradigm, resolves these challenges through a probabilistic framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific knowledge graphs lack coverage compared to general ones. DKGF aims to bridge this gap by integrating relevant facts from GKGs, despite challenges like ambiguity and granularity misalignment.

Method: ExeFuse treats GKG facts as latent semantic programs, maps relations to granularity-aware operators, and verifies domain relevance via program executability on the target DKG.

Result: The approach is validated on two benchmarks, DKGF(W-I) and DKGF(Y-I), with 21 configurations. Experiments confirm the task's importance and the model's effectiveness.

Conclusion: ExeFuse provides a standardized testbed for DKGF, effectively addressing domain relevance and granularity issues in knowledge graph fusion.

Abstract: Domain-specific knowledge graphs (DKGs) often lack coverage compared to general knowledge graphs (GKGs). To address this, we introduce Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Fusion (DKGF), a novel task that enriches DKGs by integrating relevant facts from GKGs. DKGF faces two key challenges: high ambiguity in domain relevance and misalignment in knowledge granularity across graphs. We propose ExeFuse, a simple yet effective Fact-as-Program paradigm. It treats each GKG fact as a latent semantic program, maps abstract relations to granularity-aware operators, and verifies domain relevance via program executability on the target DKG. This unified probabilistic framework jointly resolves relevance and granularity issues. We construct two benchmarks, DKGF(W-I) and DKGF(Y-I), with 21 evaluation configurations. Extensive experiments validate the task's importance and our model's effectiveness, providing the first standardized testbed for DKGF.

TL;DR: GRACE is a neuro-symbolic architecture ensuring AI agents' decisions are normatively aligned by decoupling moral reasoning from instrumental actions, enhancing interpretability and compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for AI agents to make decisions that are not only effective but also morally aligned, especially as they become more autonomous and impactful.

Method: Introduces GRACE, a three-module system: Moral Module (deontic logic-based reasoning), Decision-Making Module (optimal actions), and Guard (enforcement). Uses symbolic representation for transparency and verification.

Result: Successfully demonstrated on an LLM therapy assistant, allowing stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.

Conclusion: GRACE provides a scalable and interpretable framework for ensuring normative alignment in AI decision-making, with potential for broad application.

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study introduces a diagnostic framework to analyze generalization failures in fine-tuned LLMs like Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral, revealing architecture-data synergy affects performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why fine-tuned LLMs fail to generalize despite state-of-the-art performance is crucial for reliable AI.

Method: Multi-layered diagnostic framework applied via cross-architectural study, SHAP analysis, and mechanistic interpretability.

Result: Key findings include architecture-data synergy driving generalization, architecture-dependent performance, and Mistral's resilience.

Conclusion: Reliable AI requires validating architecture-data-training interplay, with Mistral showing consistent generalizability.

Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on specialized tasks, yet diagnosing why these models become brittle and fail to generalize remains a critical open problem. To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms. By pinpointing the flawed heuristics responsible for these failures, our work provides a concrete methodology for diagnosing and understanding generalization failures, underscoring that reliable AI requires deep validation of the interplay between architecture, data, and training strategy.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the safety of 7 frontier LLMs and MLLMs across language, vision-language, and image generation settings, revealing heterogeneous safety performance and vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether advancements in LLMs and MLLMs translate to improved safety, addressing gaps in fragmented evaluation practices.

Method: Integrated safety evaluation protocol using benchmark, adversarial, multilingual, and compliance evaluations across multiple modalities.

Result: GPT-5.2 shows balanced safety performance, while others exhibit trade-offs. Adversarial evaluations reveal significant vulnerabilities, especially in language and vision-language modalities.

Conclusion: Safety in frontier models is multidimensional, necessitating standardized evaluations to guide responsible development and deployment.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.

*Yinzhi Zhao,Ming Wang,Shi Feng,Xiaocui Yang,Daling Wang,Yifei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to detect latent safety signals in LLMs during decoding to defend against jailbreak attacks, improving safety without compromising utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite safety alignment, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, and existing defenses often fail or degrade model performance.

Method: The approach identifies and uses latent safety signals in the model's decoding process for early detection of unsafe content.

Result: Experiments show the method enhances safety against jailbreak attacks while maintaining low over-refusal and preserving response quality.

Conclusion: Activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding is a promising direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Motivation: Existing methods for LTLf synthesis with multiple properties rely on enumerating subsets, which is inefficient when satisfying all properties is impossible.

Conclusion: The symbolic algorithm efficiently handles LTLf synthesis with multiple properties, offering a scalable alternative to enumeration-based approaches.

Abstract: We study LTLf synthesis with multiple properties, where satisfying all properties may be impossible. Instead of enumerating subsets of properties, we compute in one fixed-point computation the relation between product-game states and the goal sets that are realizable from them, and we synthesize strategies achieving maximal realizable sets. We develop a fully symbolic algorithm that introduces Boolean goal variables and exploits monotonicity to represent exponentially many goal combinations compactly. Our approach substantially outperforms enumeration-based baselines, with speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: The paper studies the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), identifying its failure modes and proposing strategies to improve its performance, achieving a significant accuracy boost on Sudoku-Extreme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reasoning patterns of HRM, uncover its failure modes, and enhance its performance by addressing these issues.

Method: Analyzed HRM's reasoning behavior, identified three key failure modes, and proposed strategies like data augmentation, input perturbation, and model bootstrapping to improve its guesses.

Result: Augmented HRM improved accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

Conclusion: HRM's reasoning mimics 'guessing' rather than true reasoning, but leveraging this behavior through scaling strategies can significantly enhance its performance.

Abstract: Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) "Grokking" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM "guesses" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be "guessing" instead of "reasoning". Leveraging this "guessing" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%. On the scientific side, our analysis provides new insights into how reasoning models "reason".

*Amir Khurshid,Abhishek Sehgal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structure-informed, diversity-constrained context bubble framework to address fragmentation and redundancy in LLM contexts, improving coherence and citation faithfulness within token limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods fragment document structures, cause over-retrieval, and miss secondary query facets, necessitating a more efficient and structured approach.

Method: The framework organizes multi-granular spans using task-conditioned structural priors, constructs context bubbles from anchor spans, and balances relevance, coverage, and redundancy.

Result: Experiments show reduced redundancy, better secondary facet coverage, and improved answer quality and citation faithfulness within token limits.

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms top-k retrieval by preserving document structure and diversity, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of structural priors and diversity constraints.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) contexts are typically constructed using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which involves ranking and selecting the top-k passages. The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenAI helps novice designers improve performance but reduces creative self-efficacy overall. Cognitive load remains unchanged, though prompt strategies affect it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how GenAI impacts performance, self-efficacy, and cognitive load in architectural design tasks.

Method: 36 students completed design tasks independently and with GenAI or a control tool. Outcomes were rated by experts, and self-reports measured self-efficacy and cognitive load.

Result: GenAI improved performance for novices but lowered creative self-efficacy. Cognitive load was similar across conditions, influenced by prompt usage.

Conclusion: GenAI's effectiveness varies by user expertise and interaction strategies.

Abstract: Our study examines how generative AI (GenAI) influences performance, creative self-efficacy, and cognitive load in architectural conceptual design tasks. Thirty-six student participants from Architectural Engineering and other disciplines completed a two-phase architectural design task, first independently and then with external tools (GenAI-assisted condition and control condition using an online repository of existing architectural projects). Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI. Cognitive load did not differ significantly between conditions, though prompt usage patterns showed that iterative idea generation and visual feedback prompts were linked to greater reductions in cognitive load. These findings suggest that GenAI effectiveness depends on users' prior expertise and interaction strategies through prompting.
