To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains.

Although user simulator methods can predict a user's next utterance, they mainly imitate their speaking style rather than advancing the dialogue. Preference data synthesis has been investigated to generate data for proactive next utterance prediction and help align LLMs with user preferences.

We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation.

Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others.

Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases.

However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques.

Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM.

However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $\u03c3$, which directly limits the achievable utility.

Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \\to \\infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial.

This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning.

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction.

The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG).

We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task.

The model is trained through a two-stage process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. We design a Task-Conditioned Hybrid Reward mechanism that simultaneously optimizes SQL execution accuracy-leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree analysis and dense result matching-and semantic precision in abstention responses. To evaluate reliability alongside generation accuracy, we construct and release Ent-SQL-Bench, which jointly assesse SQL precision and boundary-aware abstention across ambiguous and unanswerable queries. Experimental results on this benchmark demonstrate that BAR-SQL achieves 91.48% average accuracy, outperforming leading proprietary models, including Claude 4.5 Sonnet and GPT-5, in both SQL generation quality and boundary-aware abstention capability.

We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck.

We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive.

In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations.

Steering towards the Assistant direction reinforces helpful and harmless behavior; steering away increases the model's tendency to identify as other entities. Moreover, steering away with more extreme values often induces a mystical, theatrical speaking style.

Testing 13 models across two protocols, we find striking patterns: anchoring to 1990 (vs. 2030) raises stereotype selection in all models tested on this contrast (p<0.05); gossip framing raises it in 5 of 6 full-grid models; out-group observer framing shifts it by up to 13 percentage points.

To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets).
