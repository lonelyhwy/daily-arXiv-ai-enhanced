TL;DR: FOFPred is a language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model combining Vision-Language and Diffusion architectures for future motion prediction, trained on noisy web data and applied to control and generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting generalizable dense motion representations (like optical flow) is challenging, especially from noisy real-world data, and lacks exploration.

Method: Introduces FOFPred, a unified Vision-Language-Diffusion model trained on web-scale human activity data with robust preprocessing and pretraining.

Result: Achieves cross-domain versatility in robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven conditions.

Conclusion: FOFPred's unified architecture and scalable training from diverse web data prove effective for optical flow prediction.

Abstract: Future motion representations, such as optical flow, offer immense value for control and generative tasks. However, forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations remains a key challenge, and learning such forecasting from noisy, real-world data remains relatively unexplored. We introduce FOFPred, a novel language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model featuring a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture. This unique combination enables strong multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity for future motion prediction. Our model is trained on web-scale human activity data-a highly scalable but unstructured source. To extract meaningful signals from this noisy video-caption data, we employ crucial data preprocessing techniques and our unified architecture with strong image pretraining. The resulting trained model is then extended to tackle two distinct downstream tasks in control and generation. Evaluations across robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven settings establish the cross-domain versatility of FOFPred, confirming the value of a unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICONIC-444, a large-scale industrial image dataset for OOD detection research, addressing gaps in existing datasets by offering diverse, structured data and benchmarking tasks with baseline results for 22 methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large, high-quality datasets with clearly defined OOD categories for varying difficulty levels in computer vision tasks.

Method: Creation of ICONIC-444, a dataset with 3.1 million RGB images across 444 classes, captured using a prototype industrial sorting machine to mimic real-world tasks.

Result: ICONIC-444 provides structured, diverse data for rigorous OOD evaluation and includes baseline results for 22 state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

Conclusion: ICONIC-444 fills a critical gap in OOD detection research, offering a robust dataset and benchmarking framework to advance the field.

Abstract: Current progress in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is limited by the lack of large, high-quality datasets with clearly defined OOD categories across varying difficulty levels (near- to far-OOD) that support both fine- and coarse-grained computer vision tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce ICONIC-444 (Image Classification and OOD Detection with Numerous Intricate Complexities), a specialized large-scale industrial image dataset containing over 3.1 million RGB images spanning 444 classes tailored for OOD detection research. Captured with a prototype industrial sorting machine, ICONIC-444 closely mimics real-world tasks. It complements existing datasets by offering structured, diverse data suited for rigorous OOD evaluation across a spectrum of task complexities. We define four reference tasks within ICONIC-444 to benchmark and advance OOD detection research and provide baseline results for 22 state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection methods.

### [3] [Can Vision-Language Models Understand Construction Workers? An Exploratory Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10835)
*Hieu Bui,Nathaniel E. Chodosh,Arash Tavakoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates three Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for recognizing construction worker actions and emotions from images, finding GPT-4o outperforms Florence 2 and LLaVa-1.5, though challenges remain in distinguishing similar categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in construction need to interpret human behavior for safe collaboration. VLMs offer potential for recognizing behaviors without extensive training, addressing the scarcity of labeled data in construction.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5 on a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated for actions and emotions, using standardized inference pipelines and multiple metrics.

Result: GPT-4o performed best (F1: 0.756 action, 0.712 emotion), followed by Florence 2 (F1: 0.497 action, 0.414 emotion), and LLaVa-1.5 (F1: 0.466 action, 0.461 emotion). All models struggled with semantically close categories.

Conclusion: General-purpose VLMs provide a baseline for behavior recognition in construction, but improvements like domain adaptation or multimodal sensing are needed for real-world reliability.

Abstract: As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.

### [4] [One Model, Many Behaviors: Training-Induced Effects on Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10836)
*Gerhard Krumpl,Henning Avenhaus,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Investigating the link between training strategies and OOD detection performance reveals no single optimal method and a non-monotonic relationship with ID accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how modern training pipelines impact OOD detection performance, given its importance for robust machine-learning systems.

Method: Comprehensive empirical study benchmarking 21 OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models using ResNet-50, evaluated on eight OOD test sets.

Result: Higher ID accuracy doesn't always mean better OOD detection; performance peaks then declines with advanced training. No universal optimal method exists.

Conclusion: Training strategy, detector choice, and OOD performance are interdependent; no single OOD detection method suits all scenarios.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust and reliable machine-learning systems in open-world settings. Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored. We investigate this link through a comprehensive empirical study. Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.

### [5] [Effects of Different Attention Mechanisms Applied on 3D Models in Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10854)
*Mohammad Rasras,Iuliana Marin,Serban Radu,Irina Mocanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how reducing temporal data knowledge while increasing frame resolution affects human action recognition, testing modified 3D Resnet models with attention blocks on UCF101.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of temporal feature reduction and frame resolution enhancement on model performance in human action recognition.

Method: Modified MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D models with dropout layers and added attention blocks (CBAM, TCN, multi-headed, channel attention). Tested on UCF101.

Result: Best accuracy was 88.98% for modified R(2+1)D with multi-headed attention. Variants showed varied class-level accuracy despite similar overall improvements.

Conclusion: Missing temporal features significantly impact performance in high-resolution models, with attention blocks influencing class-level accuracy differently.

Abstract: Human action recognition has become an important research focus in computer vision due to the wide range of applications where it is used. 3D Resnet-based CNN models, particularly MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D, have different convolutional filters to extract spatiotemporal features. This paper investigates the impact of reducing the captured knowledge from temporal data, while increasing the resolution of the frames. To establish this experiment, we created similar designs to the three originals, but with a dropout layer added before the final classifier. Secondly, we then developed ten new versions for each one of these three designs. The variants include special attention blocks within their architecture, such as convolutional block attention module (CBAM), temporal convolution networks (TCN), in addition to multi-headed and channel attention mechanisms. The purpose behind that is to observe the extent of the influence each of these blocks has on performance for the restricted-temporal models. The results of testing all the models on UCF101 have shown accuracy of 88.98% for the variant with multiheaded attention added to the modified R(2+1)D. This paper concludes the significance of missing temporal features in the performance of the newly created increased resolution models. The variants had different behavior on class-level accuracy, despite the similarity of their enhancements to the overall performance.

### [6] [Medical SAM3: A Foundation Model for Universal Prompt-Driven Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10880)
*Chongcong Jiang,Tianxingjian Ding,Chuhan Song,Jiachen Tu,Ziyang Yan,Yihua Shao,Zhenyi Wang,Yuzhang Shang,Tianyu Han,Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical SAM3 enhances SAM3 for medical image segmentation by fine-tuning on diverse datasets, addressing domain shifts and complex anatomical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of SAM3 to medical images is limited by domain shifts and lack of spatial prompts, necessitating adaptation.

Method: Fine-tuning SAM3 on 33 medical datasets across 10 modalities to improve domain-specific performance while retaining prompt flexibility.

Result: Significant performance gains in challenging scenarios like semantic ambiguity and long-range 3D context.

Conclusion: Medical SAM3 is a universal, text-guided model highlighting the need for holistic adaptation in medical segmentation.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift. Code and model will be made available at https://github.com/AIM-Research-Lab/Medical-SAM3.

### [7] [FrankenMotion: Part-level Human Motion Generation and Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10909)
*Chuqiao Li,Xianghui Xie,Yong Cao,Andreas Geiger,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FrankenMotion, a diffusion-based framework for generating human motions with fine-grained part-level control, enabled by a new dataset with atomic, temporally-aware text annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained control over individual body parts due to coarse motion annotations.

Method: Constructs a dataset with atomic, part-level annotations using LLMs and proposes FrankenMotion, a diffusion-based framework guided by temporal part-level prompts.

Result: FrankenMotion outperforms baselines and can generate unseen motion compositions.

Conclusion: The work advances motion generation with spatial and temporal control, supported by a novel dataset.

Abstract: Human motion generation from text prompts has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training. Our code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

*Tasneem Shaffee,Sherief Reda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobuMTL improves robustness in Multi-Task Learning by dynamically adapting to input perturbations using hierarchical LoRA modules, outperforming baselines in adverse weather conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance degradation in autonomous systems under diverse real-world conditions, especially adverse weather.

Method: Dynamic selection of task-specific hierarchical LoRA modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations.

Result: +2.8% avg improvement on PASCAL, +44.4% under mixed weather; +9.7% avg on NYUD-v2.

Conclusion: RobuMTL enhances robustness and reliability in MTL systems, verified by significant improvements over baselines.

Abstract: Robust Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is crucial for autonomous systems operating in real-world environments, where adverse weather conditions can severely degrade model performance and reliability. In this paper, we introduce RobuMTL, a novel architecture designed to adaptively address visual degradation by dynamically selecting task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations in a mixture-of-experts fashion. Our framework enables adaptive specialization based on input characteristics, improving robustness across diverse real-world conditions. To validate our approach, we evaluated it on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets and compared it against single-task models, standard MTL baselines, and state-of-the-art methods. On the PASCAL benchmark, RobuMTL delivers a +2.8% average relative improvement under single perturbations and up to +44.4% under mixed weather conditions compared to the MTL baseline. On NYUD-v2, RobuMTL achieves a +9.7% average relative improvement across tasks. The code is available at GitHub.

*David Szczecina,Hudson Sun,Anthony Bertnyk,Niloofar Azad,Kyle Gao,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates five architectures for tree canopy detection under extreme data scarcity, finding pretrained CNN-based models (YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN) outperform transformer-based ones (DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet, DINOv2).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of training deep models for tree canopy detection with a small, imbalanced dataset (150 images) to avoid overfitting.

Method: Evaluated five architectures (YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, DINOv2) for canopy segmentation under data scarcity, analyzing training strategies and augmentation policies.

Result: Pretrained CNN-based models generalized better than transformer-based ones, which struggled due to task differences and high data requirements.

Conclusion: Lightweight CNN-based methods are more reliable for canopy detection in low-data regimes, while transformer-based architectures need substantial pretraining or augmentation.

Abstract: Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.

### [11] [PatientVLM Meets DocVLM: Pre-Consultation Dialogue Between Vision-Language Models for Efficient Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10945)
*K Lokesh,Abhirama Subramanyam Penamakuri,Uday Agarwal,Apoorva Challa,Shreya K Gowda,Somesh Gupta,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI in medical diagnosis often focuses on image analysis, missing symptom inputs. The proposed PCDF uses two VLMs (DocVLM and PatientVLM) for realistic diagnostic dialogues, improving accuracy with symptom inclusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI medical diagnosis lacks patient-reported symptoms, limiting accuracy. The authors aim to integrate symptom elicitation through dialogue, mimicking real-world doctor-patient interactions.

Method: Developed a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) with two VLMs: DocVLM (asks questions) and PatientVLM (provides symptom responses). Validated synthetic symptoms with clinicians.

Result: Clinicians confirmed symptom realism and coverage. DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions improved diagnostic accuracy over image-only methods.

Conclusion: Dialogue-based supervision enhances diagnostic accuracy, proving the value of integrating symptom elicitation in AI medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Traditionally, AI research in medical diagnosis has largely centered on image analysis. While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMedExpert-R1 addresses MedVLMs' limitations in clinical reasoning by introducing domain-specific adaptation and guideline-based reinforcement, achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MedVLMs struggle with complex clinical reasoning due to data scarcity and misalignment with multi-specialty needs.

Method: MMedExpert-R1 uses Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) and Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) to enhance reasoning, supported by a 10K-sample dataset.

Result: Achieved 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: MMedExpert-R1 provides a reliable foundation for multimodal medical reasoning systems.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with complex clinical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our 7B model achieving 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, establishing a robust foundation for reliable multimodal medical reasoning systems.

*Xianliang Huang,Jiajie Gou,Shuhang Chen,Zhizhou Zhong,Jihong Guan,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDDR-NGP is a unified method for removing various 3D scene distractors like snowflakes and confetti, using implicit 3D representations and 2D detectors, trained end-to-end with LPIPS and MVCL losses, and validated on a new benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on specific distractors, limiting their applicability. IDDR-NGP aims to address this by offering a unified solution capable of handling diverse distractor types.

Method: Incorporates implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, using LPIPS and MVCL losses for joint optimization. Trains end-to-end to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes.

Result: Effectively removes multiple distractor types, validated on synthetic and real-world scenes. Comparable to SOTA desnow methods and handles both realistic and synthetic distractors.

Conclusion: IDDR-NGP is robust and effective for diverse distractor removal, demonstrated by extensive experiments and a new benchmark dataset.

Abstract: This paper presents the first unified distractor removal method, named IDDR-NGP, which directly operates on Instant-NPG. The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.

Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative modeling has made synthetic videos hard to distinguish from real ones, requiring reliable detection methods. Existing datasets and benchmarks are limited in scale, diversity, and depth.

Method: Proposed AIGVDBench, covering 31 state-of-the-art generative models and 440,000 videos. Conducted 1,500 evaluations on 33 detectors across four categories and performed 8 in-depth analyses.

Result: Identified 4 novel findings to advance AI-generated video detection. Provided a comprehensive benchmark open-sourced for future research.

Conclusion: AIGVDBench addresses gaps in dataset quality and benchmark depth, offering a foundation for future work in detecting synthetic videos.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling can create remarkably realistic synthetic videos, making it increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from real ones and necessitating reliable detection methods.
  However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field.
  \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness.
  \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored.
  Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos. By executing more than \textbf{1,500} evaluations on \textbf{33} existing detectors belonging to four distinct categories. This work presents \textbf{8 in-depth analyses} from multiple perspectives and identifies \textbf{4 novel findings} that offer valuable insights for future research. We hope this work provides a solid foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection.

*Takuya Murakawa,Takumi Fukuzawa,Ning Ding,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3DDM+ improves video outpainting quality by addressing training-inference mismatch in masking strategies, enhancing visual fidelity and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: M3DDM's quality degradation in challenging scenarios (limited motion/large regions) is traced to inconsistent masking between training and inference.

Method: M3DDM+ introduces uniform mask direction and width during training and fine-tunes the pretrained M3DDM model.

Result: M3DDM+ significantly improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence while retaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed M3DDM+ effectively resolves the limitations of M3DDM for video outpainting.

Abstract: M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Qiyuan Zhang,Biao Gong,Shuai Tan,Zheng Zhang,Yujun Shen,Xing Zhu,Yuyuan Li,Kelu Yao,Chunhua Shen,Changqing Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation to enforce physical collision rules, addressing limitations in current transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based video generation lacks adherence to physical principles, particularly rigid body motion, limiting realism. Physics-based simulators excel in modeling collisions, but modern methods ignore rigidity during optimization.

Method: The authors propose a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm enforcing collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, extended into MDcycle for fine-tuning while preserving physics feedback.

Result: They validate their approach using PhysRVGBench, demonstrating improved realism through qualitative and quantitative experiments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates physical constraints into video generation, enhancing realism without compromising model adaptability.

Abstract: Physical principles are fundamental to realistic visual simulation, but remain a significant oversight in transformer-based video generation. This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.

### [17] [CoDance: An Unbind-Rebind Paradigm for Robust Multi-Subject Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11096)
*Shuai Tan,Biao Gong,Ke Ma,Yutong Feng,Qiyuan Zhang,Yan Wang,Yujun Shen,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDance introduces an Unbind-Rebind framework for animating multiple characters with diverse types and spatial misalignments, outperforming existing methods and generalizing well across scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle multi-subject animation due to rigid spatial binding and inconsistent motion rebinding, limiting flexibility and robustness.

Method: CoDance uses an Unbind module with pose shift encoder to break rigid spatial binding and a Rebind module with semantic and spatial guidance to direct motion to intended subjects.

Result: CoDance achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, enabling flexible and robust multi-subject animation.

Abstract: Character image animation is gaining significant importance across various domains, driven by the demand for robust and flexible multi-subject rendering. While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The code and weights will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel graph-based method for 3D point cloud analysis, addressing issues like sparse and noisy connections by integrating graph smoothing and enhanced local geometry learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based methods struggle with suboptimal structures due to sparse connections at boundaries and noisy connections in junctions.

Method: The method combines a graph smoothing module to optimize structures and a local geometry learning module using adaptive geometric descriptors and cylindrical coordinate transformation.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show improved performance in classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances graph-based point cloud analysis by optimizing structures and leveraging local geometry.

Abstract: Graph-based methods have proven to be effective in capturing relationships among points for 3D point cloud analysis. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections. Based on the optimized graph structure, we improve the feature extract function with local geometry information. These include shape features derived from adaptive geometric descriptors based on eigenvectors and distribution features obtained through cylindrical coordinate transformation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various point cloud learning tasks, i.e., classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIGA is a task- and model-agnostic framework addressing vision-as-inverse-graphics through iterative multimodal reasoning, achieving significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of fine-grained spatial and physical grounding in vision-as-inverse-graphics, which existing VLMs lack.

Method: VIGA employs a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure with a skill library and context memory for long-horizon reasoning.

Result: VIGA improves baseline performance on BlenderGym (35.32%), SlideBench (117.17%), and BlenderBench (124.70%) without requiring additional modules or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: VIGA demonstrates robust, unified performance across diverse tasks, highlighting its potential for evaluating and advancing vision-as-inverse-graphics capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-as-inverse-graphics, the concept of reconstructing an image as an editable graphics program is a long-standing goal of computer vision. Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.

*Ruibang Li,Guan Luo,Yiwei Zhang,Jin Gao,Bing Li,Weiming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SoLA-Vision proposes a layer-wise hybrid approach combining linear and softmax attention to balance accuracy and computational cost in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional softmax attention's quadratic complexity limits high-resolution deployment, while linear attention sacrifices modeling capacity. This study explores hybrid designs to optimize both.

Method: Analytical study and systematic experiments compare linear and softmax attention. SoLA-Vision integrates them layer-wise for fine-grained control.

Result: SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and hybrid models on ImageNet-1K and dense prediction tasks, achieving a strong accuracy-computation trade-off.

Conclusion: Layer-wise hybridization with strategic softmax insertion balances performance and efficiency, advancing vision attention models.

Abstract: Standard softmax self-attention excels in vision tasks but incurs quadratic complexity O(N^2), limiting high-resolution deployment. Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin. Code will be released.

TL;DR: ESD is an ultra-lightweight 30-m global Earth embedding database compressing multi-sensor EO data into latent vectors, enabling efficient planetary-scale analysis on standard workstations with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational and storage barriers hindering global-scale satellite data analysis, making planetary-scale studies more accessible.

Method: Transforms Landsat and MODIS data into quantized latent vectors using ESDNet and FSQ, reducing data volume by ~340-fold and encapsulating annual data in ~2.4 TB.

Result: Achieves high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543) and 79.74% accuracy in land-cover classification, outperforming raw data.

Conclusion: ESD democratizes planetary-scale research and advances geospatial AI by providing an efficient, high-fidelity embedding database.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of satellite-borne Earth Observation (EO) systems has revolutionized terrestrial monitoring, yielding petabyte-scale archives. However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543). By condensing the annual phenological cycle into 12 temporal steps, the embeddings provide inherent denoising and a semantically organized space that outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification, achieving 79.74% accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion). With robust few-shot learning capabilities and longitudinal consistency, ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing next-generation geospatial artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-modal algorithm using Rectified Flow models for joint inference of structurally aligned samples, offering faster computation and higher quality compared to existing methods like SDS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing joint generation methods lack structural alignment perspective, and SDS-based approaches are inefficient and produce low-quality results.

Method: The proposed approach uses joint transport in sample space, built on Rectified Flow models in structured latent space.

Result: Demonstrates high structural alignment and visual quality, outperforming state-of-the-art in image/video generation and matching 3D generation quality with much faster speed.

Conclusion: The method advances joint inference by improving efficiency and alignment, providing superior results in multiple domains.

Abstract: We suggest a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples with Rectified Flow models. While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.

TL;DR: The paper introduces unsupervised multi-scenario person re-identification (UMS-ReID) and proposes a three-stage framework (ITKM) leveraging vision-language models to handle diverse scenarios adaptively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of person re-identification across diverse scenarios (e.g., cross-resolution, clothing change) without labeled data, the authors propose UMS-ReID and ITKM.

Method: ITKM employs a pre-trained CLIP model with a scenario-adaptive image encoder, text embedding optimization, and heterogeneous matching modules. It includes a dynamic text representation update for consistency.

Result: ITKM outperforms existing scenario-specific methods and demonstrates superior generalizability by integrating multi-scenario knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed ITKM framework effectively addresses UMS-ReID, showcasing adaptability and improved performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We propose unsupervised multi-scenario (UMS) person re-identification (ReID) as a new task that expands ReID across diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change, etc.) within a single coherent framework. To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.

TL;DR: A lightweight dual-encoder framework is proposed for efficient cross-lingual handwritten word retrieval by learning style-invariant visual embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten word retrieval is challenging due to handwriting variability and cross-lingual gaps, while existing large models are computationally expensive.

Method: A lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework learns unified visual embeddings by optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency.

Result: The method outperforms 28 baselines, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval, and demonstrates strong cross-lingual retrieval performance efficiently.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval with fewer parameters than existing models.

Abstract: Handwritten word retrieval is vital for digital archives but remains challenging due to large handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps. While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. We further conduct explicit cross-lingual retrieval, where the query language differs from the target language, to validate the effectiveness of the learned cross-lingual representations. Achieving strong performance with only a fraction of the parameters required by existing models, our framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FTDMamba for UAV video anomaly detection in dynamic backgrounds, addressing motion coupling and spatiotemporal modeling, and releases a new dataset (MUVAD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with UAV videos having dynamic backgrounds due to intertwined motions and inadequate spatiotemporal modeling.

Method: Proposes FTDMamba with a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module and Temporal Dilation Mamba Module.

Result: FTDMamba achieves SOTA performance on public benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset.

Conclusion: The work advances UAV VAD for dynamic backgrounds and provides a benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large ViTs offer strong generalization but require extensive data, while compact CNNs are easier to optimize in data-scarce robotic settings. The paper aims to combine their strengths.

Method: X-Distill distills knowledge from a frozen DINOv2 (ViT) teacher to a ResNet-18 student on ImageNet offline. The distilled encoder is then fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head for target tasks.

Result: X-Distill outperforms from-scratch ResNet, fine-tuned DINOv2, 3D encoders with point clouds, and larger Vision-Language Models across 34 simulated and 5 real-world tasks.

Conclusion: A simple distillation strategy effectively combines the strengths of ViTs and CNNs, achieving state-of-the-art robotic manipulation with limited data.

Abstract: Visuomotor policies often leverage large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for their powerful generalization capabilities. However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal Token Reuse (TTR) accelerates oblique aerial video segmentation for disaster response by reducing redundant computations, achieving a 30% latency reduction with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oblique aerial videos are crucial for disaster response but face SWaP constraints on UAVs, limiting on-board processing efficiency.

Method: TTR uses spatiotemporal redundancy, formulating image patches as tokens and propagating static region features to avoid redundant computations.

Result: TTR reduces inference latency by 30% with <0.5% mIoU accuracy loss on edge-grade hardware.

Conclusion: TTR enables real-time, high-fidelity oblique video processing for time-critical missions.

Abstract: Effective disaster response relies on rapid disaster response, where oblique aerial video is the primary modality for initial scouting due to its ability to maximize spatial coverage and situational awareness in limited flight time. However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of manual annotation and privacy risks of cloud services for video instance segmentation.

Method: Modified SAM2 dependency with a processing layer for efficiency; features include identity management, "lock-and-refine" workflow, and auto-prompting.

Result: Successfully applied in animal tracking and benchmark datasets, offering scalable, private segmentation.

Conclusion: SAMannot serves as a cost-effective, efficient alternative for complex video annotation tasks.

Abstract: Current research workflows for precise video segmentation are often forced into a compromise between labor-intensive manual curation, costly commercial platforms, and/or privacy-compromising cloud-based services. The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.

TL;DR: CASWiT, a Swin-based dual-branch transformer, enhances UHR image segmentation by combining global context and fine-grained features, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models struggle with UHR image segmentation due to memory constraints. CASWiT addresses this by integrating global context into high-resolution features.

Method: Uses a dual-branch architecture with a context encoder for long-range dependencies and a high-resolution encoder for detailed features. Includes cross-attention and gated feature injection. Pretrained with a SimMIM-style approach.

Result: Achieves 65.83% mIoU on IGN FLAIR-HUB and 49.1% mIoU on URUR, outperforming baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CASWiT effectively balances memory efficiency and performance for UHR image segmentation, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Semantic ultra high resolution image (UHR) segmentation is essential in remote sensing applications such as aerial mapping and environmental monitoring. Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points.

*Pavana Pradeep,Krishna Kant,Suya Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with traditional computer vision and logic reasoning to enhance situational awareness by improving detail extraction, fine-tuning accuracy, and output justification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing situational awareness by leveraging VLMs to identify significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality.

Method: Combines VLMs with traditional computer vision methods using explicit logic reasoning, employing an intelligent fine-tuning strategy and generating justifications for VLM outputs.

Result: Intelligent fine-tuning improves accuracy and provides a means to validate or question VLM outputs during inference.

Conclusion: The integration of VLMs with logic reasoning and fine-tuning significantly enhances situational awareness by improving detail extraction, accuracy, and output reliability.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the ability to generate high-level, interpretable descriptions of complex activities from images and videos, making them valuable for situational awareness (SA) applications. In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.

### [32] [Beer-Lambert Autoencoder for Unsupervised Stain Representation Learning and Deconvolution in Multi-immunohistochemical Brightfield Histology Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11336)
*Mark Eastwood,Thomas McKee,Zedong Hu,Sabine Tejpar,Fayyaz Minhas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven encoder-decoder architecture for separating stains in RGB histology WSIs, addressing limitations of classical BL deconvolution in multiplex IHC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise stain separation in multiplex IHC WSIs for applications like stain normalization and quantitative marker assessment.

Method: The proposed method uses a U-Net encoder and differentiable BL decoder, trained unsupervisedly with perceptual loss and stain-mixing discouragement.

Result: The approach achieves high-quality RGB reconstruction and reduces inter-channel bleed-through compared to matrix-based deconvolution.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles multiplex IHC with >3 stains, outperforming traditional techniques.

Abstract: Separating the contributions of individual chromogenic stains in RGB histology whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for stain normalization, quantitative assessment of marker expression, and cell-level readouts in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

*Steffen Knoblauch,Ram Kumar Muthusamy,Hao Li,Iddy Chazua,Benedcto Adamu,Innocent Maholi,Alexander Zipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using UAV and street-view imagery analyzes heat-relevant building attributes in urban areas, identifying inequalities in heat exposure and informing climate adaptation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change increases heat exposure in urban areas, especially in the Global South, but scalable methods to assess heat-relevant building attributes are lacking.

Method: The study uses a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to fuse UAV and street-view imagery, validated with thermal infrared measurements from HotSat-1.

Result: The dual-modality approach outperforms single-modality models by up to 9.3%, identifying associations between building materials/vegetation and lower heat exposure.

Conclusion: The framework highlights localized, data-driven risk assessment's role in equitable climate adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying human heat exposure, particularly in densely built urban centers of the Global South. Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with long-form videos due to computational limits and poor frame selection, prompting the need for an improved method.

Method: TCS introduces Multi-Query Reasoning for capturing diverse video aspects and Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling to balance detail and context.

Result: TCS boosts accuracy by up to 6.9% and reduces inference time by 50% while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: TCS effectively addresses long video understanding challenges, offering a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Recent progress in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding. However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.

*Haomiao Tang,Jinpeng Wang,Minyi Zhao,Guanghao Meng,Ruisheng Luo,Long Chen,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HUG, a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided paradigm for Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), addressing intrinsic noise and uncertainty by fine-grained probabilistic learning and dynamic weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address intrinsic noise and uncertainty in CIR triplets, which threaten model robustness, by moving beyond instance-level holistic modeling.

Method: HUG uses Gaussian embeddings for queries and targets, customizes heterogeneous uncertainty estimations, and employs uncertainty-guided objectives with negative sampling.

Result: HUG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: HUG successfully enhances discriminative learning in CIR by capturing uncertainties dynamically and comprehensively.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables image search by combining a reference image with modification text. Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.

*Hanlin Wu,Pengfei Lin,Ehsan Javanmardi,Nanren Bao,Bo Qian,Hao Si,Manabu Tsukada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SUG-Occ is a sparse learning framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction that reduces computation and memory overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for autonomous driving but faces high computational costs, hindering real-time deployment.

Method: SUG-Occ uses semantic and uncertainty priors for sparse representation, cascade sparse completion, and an OCR-based mask decoder for efficient reasoning.

Result: The method improves accuracy by 7.34% and efficiency by 57.8% on SemanticKITTI.

Conclusion: SUG-Occ successfully balances computational efficiency and prediction accuracy for 3D occupancy tasks.

Abstract: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WetSAM improves wetland mapping by integrating temporal data with sparse point supervision, outperforming existing methods with an 85.58% F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models struggle with sparse labels and temporal dynamics in wetland mapping, while foundation models like SAM lack temporal capabilities.

Method: WetSAM combines a temporally prompted branch for dynamic aggregation and a spatial branch for pseudo-labels, using bidirectional consistency regularization.

Result: WetSAM achieves an average F1-score of 85.58% across eight regions, demonstrating accurate and consistent segmentation.

Conclusion: WetSAM offers scalable, low-cost wetland mapping with strong generalization, addressing key limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.

TL;DR: A novel framework integrates width information into topological structures for image segmentation, combining persistent homology and PDE-based smoothing to preserve connectivity, genus, and width attributes like thickness and length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topological methods lack dimensional width information, limiting their effectiveness in practical image segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes a mathematical framework integrating width into topological structures using persistent homology and PDE-based smoothing, applied via variational models and neural networks with tailored loss functions.

Result: Numerical experiments confirm the method's ability to preserve topological invariants (e.g., connectivity, genus) and width properties (e.g., thickness, length) in segmented images.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between topological priors and width-aware segmentation, enhancing practical applicability.

Abstract: Existing research highlights the crucial role of topological priors in image segmentation, particularly in preserving essential structures such as connectivity and genus. Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for explainable and interpretable spatial reasoning in 3D vision-language models drove the development of Map2Thought.

Method: The framework integrates Metric-CogMap (unifying discrete and continuous spatial representations) and Cog-CoT (performing deterministic geometric reasoning with interpretable traces).

Result: Map2Thought achieves 59.9% accuracy with half the supervision, nearly matching the 60.9% baseline, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 5.3%.

Conclusion: Map2Thought advances 3D understanding by offering explainability and efficiency in spatial reasoning.

Abstract: We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets, respectively, on the VSI-Bench.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MHA2MLA-VLM, a framework adapting existing VLMs to MLA architecture efficiently, reducing KV cache size and maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing memory and computational bottlenecks caused by KV cache growth in VLMs during inference, without costly pretraining.

Method: Uses modality-adaptive partial-RoPE and modality-decoupled low-rank approximation to compress KV cache, with parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Restores original model performance with minimal data, reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates with KV quantization.

Conclusion: MHA2MLA-VLM efficiently adapts VLMs to MLA, solving bottlenecks while maintaining performance.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models rely on imitation learning and underuse their generative potential. GeRo aims to leverage generative capabilities for better planning and interpretability.

Method: GeRo trains a VLA model to encode dynamics into latent tokens, then performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation with rollout-consistency loss to stabilize predictions.

Result: GeRo improves driving score by +15.7 and success rate by +26.2 on Bench2Drive, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: GeRo demonstrates the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor environments change dynamically, but existing methods struggle with sparse temporal data and lack temporal reasoning.

Method: Introduces ReScene4D, adapting 3DSIS architectures for 4D tasks by sharing contextual information across sparse observations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset using the novel t-mAP metric.

Conclusion: ReScene4D sets a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes, improving both temporal consistency and 3DSIS quality.

Abstract: Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.

Result: ShapeR improves Chamfer distance by 2.7x over state-of-the-art methods and introduces a benchmark of 178 real-world objects.

Conclusion: ShapeR demonstrates robust 3D shape generation from casually captured data, outperforming existing methods and providing a new evaluation benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical foundation models struggle to balance visual understanding and generation due to conflicting goals. UniX aims to unify these tasks without compromising performance.

Method: UniX decouples tasks: an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for generation. Cross-modal self-attention guides generation using understanding features, supported by data cleaning and multi-stage training.

Result: UniX improves understanding performance by 46.1% (Micro-F1) and generation quality by 24.2% (FD-RadDino) while using fewer parameters compared to LLM-CXR.

Conclusion: UniX establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation, matching task-specific models' performance.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

*Tommaso Felice Banfi,Sashenka Gamage*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel LLM framework for game-theoretic reasoning, tested on Tic-Tac-Toe, improves decision quality by dynamically adjusting examples and reasoning paths based on uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM performance in sequential decision-making by integrating uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning.

Method: Combines in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought reasoning and adaptive context retrieval, adjusting examples and paths based on token-level uncertainty.

Result: Substantially improves game outcomes from -11.6% to +9.5% over 100 games, with fewer LLM queries and significant statistical validation.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning effectively boosts LLM performance in sequential tasks like game theory.

Abstract: We propose a novel LLM-based framework for reasoning in discrete, game-theoretic tasks, illustrated with \emph{Tic-Tac-Toe}. The method integrates in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and adaptive context retrieval. The model dynamically adjusts both the number of retrieved examples and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty: concise reasoning with minimal context is used when uncertainty is low, whereas higher uncertainty triggers expanded multi-path CoT exploration. Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \(-11.6\%\) with the baseline LLM to \(+9.5\%\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality. These findings demonstrate that uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning effectively enhances LLM performance in sequential decision-making environments.

*Syed Waqas Zamir,Wassim Hamidouche,Boulbaba Ben Amor,Luana Marotti,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Juan Lavista Ferres*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BYOL is a framework for developing language-aware LLMs tailored to resource-disparate languages, improving performance for low-resource languages like Chichewa and Maori, and enabling access for extreme-low-resource languages like Inuktitut via translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the imbalance in global language resources affecting LLMs' performance and accessibility for low-resource languages.

Method: BYOL classifies languages by resource tiers and uses tailored pipelines: data refinement and expansion for low-resource languages, and translation-mediated inclusion for extreme-low-resource languages.

Result: Results show a 12% average improvement for low-resource languages and a 4 BLEU gain for Inuktitut via translation.

Conclusion: BYOL successfully bridges the gap for underrepresented languages while preserving multilingual capabilities, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual capabilities, yet remain fundamentally constrained by the severe imbalance in global language resources. While over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, only a small subset (fewer than 100) has sufficient digital presence to meaningfully influence modern LLM training. This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible. Finally, we release human-translated versions of the Global MMLU-Lite benchmark in Chichewa, Maori, and Inuktitut, and make our codebase and models publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/byol .

*Young-Min Cho,Yuan Yuan,Sharath Chandra Guntuku,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates unintended side effects of style features in LLM prompts, revealing structured cross-feature impacts and challenges in achieving faithful style control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study how prompting for one style feature (e.g., conciseness) affects others (e.g., perceived expertise) in LLM conversational agents, given the lack of understanding in this area.

Method: A survey of 127 papers identified 12 common style features. Controlled synthetic dialogues and an LLM-as-a-Judge framework quantified causal cross-feature effects. The CASSE dataset was created to capture these interactions.

Result: Style features are deeply entangled; prompting for one often suppresses others (e.g., conciseness reduces expertise). Mitigation strategies partially restore traits but degrade primary styles.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the assumption of independent style control in LLMs, calling for multi-objective and principled approaches to stylistic steering.

Abstract: Style features such as friendly, helpful, or concise are widely used in prompts to steer the behavior of Large Language Model (LLM) conversational agents, yet their unintended side effects remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first systematic study of cross-feature stylistic side effects. We conduct a comprehensive survey of 127 conversational agent papers from ACL Anthology and identify 12 frequently used style features. Using controlled, synthetic dialogues across task-oriented and open domain settings, we quantify how prompting for one style feature causally affects others via a pairwise LLM as a Judge evaluation framework. Our results reveal consistent and structured side effects, such as prompting for conciseness significantly reduces perceived expertise. They demonstrate that style features are deeply entangled rather than orthogonal. To support future research, we introduce CASSE (Conversational Agent Stylistic Side Effects), a dataset capturing these complex interactions. We further evaluate prompt based and activation steering based mitigation strategies and find that while they can partially restore suppressed traits, they often degrade the primary intended style. These findings challenge the assumption of faithful style control in LLMs and highlight the need for multi-objective and more principled approaches to safe, targeted stylistic steering in conversational agents.

### [48] [Reasoning Models Generate Societies of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10825)
*Junsol Kim,Shiyang Lai,Nino Scherrer,Blaise Agüera y Arcas,James Evans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models achieve superior reasoning by simulating multi-agent interactions ("society of thought"), enabling diverse cognitive perspectives and debate, which outperform instruction-tuned models in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to uncover why reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B surpass instruction-tuned models in complex cognitive tasks, hypothesizing that multi-agent-like interactions diversify perspectives and enhance problem-solving.

Method: The research uses quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods on reasoning traces to examine perspective diversity and conversational behaviors in models. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments fine-tune models with conversational scaffolding.

Result: Reasoning models exhibit greater perspective diversity, activating conflict among heterogeneous traits and expertise, leading to accuracy advantages. Fine-tuning with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvements.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that simulating multi-agent interactions ("society of thought") enhances reasoning by diversifying cognitive perspectives, mirroring collective intelligence in human groups, and suggests opportunities for improved agent organization.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities across domains, yet mechanisms underlying sophisticated reasoning remain elusive. Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish a computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured, which suggests new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds.

### [49] [EncodeRec: An Embedding Backbone for Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10837)
*Guy Hadad,Neomi Rabaev,Bracha Shapira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EncodeRec aligns PLM embeddings with recommendation goals, producing compact, domain-specific embeddings without retraining PLMs, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLM embeddings lack structure and domain-specificity for recommendations.

Method: EncodeRec learns embeddings from item descriptions with frozen PLM parameters.

Result: EncodeRec outperforms PLM-based and embedding model baselines.

Conclusion: Embedding adaptation is key to bridging PLMs and recommender systems.

Abstract: Recent recommender systems increasingly leverage embeddings from large pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, such embeddings exhibit two key limitations: (1) PLMs are not explicitly optimized to produce structured and discriminative embedding spaces, and (2) their representations remain overly generic, often failing to capture the domain-specific semantics crucial for recommendation tasks. We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines. These results underscore the pivotal role of embedding adaptation in bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and practical recommender systems.

*Parisa Rabbani,Priyam Sahoo,Ruben Mathew,Aishee Mondal,Harshita Ketharaman,Nimet Beyza Bozdag,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit framing bias ('dialogic deference') in evaluating dialogue claims, showing shifts in judgment based on presentation. DialDefer detects these shifts, revealing domain-specific tendencies toward agreement or disagreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the reliability of LLMs as third-party judges in dialogue, especially how framing affects their evaluations.

Method: Introduces DialDefer framework and Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) to measure framing-induced judgment shifts across domains and models.

Result: Large shifts in judgments (up to 87pp) occur due to framing, while accuracy remains stable. Human attribution drives the biggest shifts.

Conclusion: LLM judgments are sensitive to conversational framing, posing calibration challenges beyond accuracy optimization.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used as third-party judges, yet their reliability when evaluating speakers in dialogue remains poorly understood. We show that LLMs judge identical claims differently depending on framing: the same content elicits different verdicts when presented as a statement to verify ("Is this statement correct?") versus attributed to a speaker ("Is this speaker correct?"). We call this dialogic deference and introduce DialDefer, a framework for detecting and mitigating these framing-induced judgment shifts. Our Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) captures directional shifts that aggregate accuracy obscures. Across nine domains, 3k+ instances, and four models, conversational framing induces large shifts (|DDS| up to 87pp, p < .0001) while accuracy remains stable (<2pp), with effects amplifying 2-4x on naturalistic Reddit conversations. Models can shift toward agreement (deference) or disagreement (skepticism) depending on domain -- the same model ranges from DDS = -53 on graduate-level science to +58 on social judgment. Ablations reveal that human-vs-LLM attribution drives the largest shifts (17.7pp swing), suggesting models treat disagreement with humans as more costly than with AI. Mitigation attempts reduce deference but can over-correct into skepticism, framing this as a calibration problem beyond accuracy optimization.

TL;DR: A novel method automates FST construction using RNN-learned hidden state geometry, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual construction of FSTs is difficult; automation improves efficiency and performance.

Method: Automated FST construction leveraging RNN-learned hidden state geometry.

Result: Highly accurate FSTs, outperforming classical methods by up to 87%.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for real-world tasks like inflection and normalization.

Abstract: Finite-State Transducers (FSTs) are effective models for string-to-string rewriting tasks, often providing the efficiency necessary for high-performance applications, but constructing transducers by hand is difficult. In this work, we propose a novel method for automatically constructing unweighted FSTs following the hidden state geometry learned by a recurrent neural network. We evaluate our methods on real-world datasets for morphological inflection, grapheme-to-phoneme prediction, and historical normalization, showing that the constructed FSTs are highly accurate and robust for many datasets, substantially outperforming classical transducer learning algorithms by up to 87% accuracy on held-out test sets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolyGloss introduces neural models for joint prediction of interlinear glosses and morphological segmentation, outperforming existing models like GlossLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing glossing models like GlossLM lack morpheme boundary prediction, reducing their practical usefulness for linguists.

Method: PolyGloss, a seq2seq multilingual model, is pretrained for joint segmentation and glossing, optimizing task alignment and accuracy.

Result: PolyGloss outperforms GlossLM in glossing and beats other LLMs in segmentation, glossing, and alignment. It also adapts quickly to new datasets.

Conclusion: Joint prediction of segmentation and glossing improves interpretability and trustworthiness, making PolyGloss a practical tool for language documentation.

Abstract: Automated interlinear gloss prediction with neural networks is a promising approach to accelerate language documentation efforts. However, while state-of-the-art models like GlossLM achieve high scores on glossing benchmarks, user studies with linguists have found critical barriers to the usefulness of such models in real-world scenarios. In particular, existing models typically generate morpheme-level glosses but assign them to whole words without predicting the actual morpheme boundaries, making the predictions less interpretable and thus untrustworthy to human annotators.
  We conduct the first study on neural models that jointly predict interlinear glosses and the corresponding morphological segmentation from raw text. We run experiments to determine the optimal way to train models that balance segmentation and glossing accuracy, as well as the alignment between the two tasks. We extend the training corpus of GlossLM and pretrain PolyGloss, a family of seq2seq multilingual models for joint segmentation and glossing that outperforms GlossLM on glossing and beats various open-source LLMs on segmentation, glossing, and alignment. In addition, we demonstrate that PolyGloss can be quickly adapted to a new dataset via low-rank adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper discusses selecting pretrained language models for social science research using validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability as criteria, emphasizing model openness, footprint, training data, and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing availability of pretrained language models raises questions about how social scientists should choose among them, focusing on practical and methodological considerations.

Method: The study explores criteria like validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability, analyzing factors such as model openness, footprint, training data, and architectures. It critiques overreliance on benchmarks and advocates for ex-post validation.

Result: The findings suggest prioritizing replicability and starting with smaller, open models to validate computational pipelines through delimited benchmarks.

Conclusion: Social scientists should favor replicability and open models, using structured benchmarks to ensure validity and reliability in research involving language models.

Abstract: Currently, there are thousands of large pretrained language models (LLMs) available to social scientists. How do we select among them? Using validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability as guides, we explore the significance of: (1) model openness, (2) model footprint, (3) training data, and (4) model architectures and fine-tuning. While ex-ante tests of validity (i.e., benchmarks) are often privileged in these discussions, we argue that social scientists cannot altogether avoid validating computational measures (ex-post). Replicability, in particular, is a more pressing guide for selecting language models. Being able to reliably replicate a particular finding that entails the use of a language model necessitates reliably reproducing a task. To this end, we propose starting with smaller, open models, and constructing delimited benchmarks to demonstrate the validity of the entire computational pipeline.

TL;DR: Ch-PatientSim is a Chinese patient simulation dataset designed to improve clinical LLMs by using realistic scenarios and a five-dimensional persona structure. The paper introduces MSPRP, a framework enhancing model responses for better personalization and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack authenticity in doctor-patient interactions due to generic or LLM-generated data. Ch-PatientSim aims to address this gap.

Method: The dataset is built from realistic clinical scenarios, augmented with few-shot generation and manual verification. MSPRP decomposes interactions into three stages for improved responses.

Result: Most LLMs produce overly formal responses; MSPRP significantly improves performance in patient simulation.

Conclusion: Ch-PatientSim and MSPRP enhance the realism and diversity of clinical LLM interactions, addressing limitations of current methods.

Abstract: The simulation of realistic clinical interactions plays a pivotal role in advancing clinical Large Language Models (LLMs) and supporting medical diagnostic education. Existing approaches and benchmarks rely on generic or LLM-generated dialogue data, which limits the authenticity and diversity of doctor-patient interactions. In this work, we propose the first Chinese patient simulation dataset (Ch-PatientSim), constructed from realistic clinical interaction scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the performance of models in emulating patient behavior. Patients are simulated based on a five-dimensional persona structure. To address issues of the persona class imbalance, a portion of the dataset is augmented using few-shot generation, followed by manual verification. We evaluate various state-of-the-art LLMs and find that most produce overly formal responses that lack individual personality. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free Multi-Stage Patient Role-Playing (MSPRP) framework, which decomposes interactions into three stages to ensure both personalization and realism in model responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves model performance across multiple dimensions of patient simulation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free inference-time logit intervention method for steering LLMs, addressing limitations of current prompting-based and activation-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for steering LLMs (like prompting or activation-based techniques) lack consistency, fine-grained control, or require deep model access.

Method: Uses a statistical token score table from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to adjust decoding distribution.

Result: Empirical tests on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity show significant improvements: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1.

Conclusion: The method provides broad, consistent, and task-agnostic control over LLM outputs.

Abstract: Steering LLMs is essential for specialized applications such as style-sensitive text rewriting, user-adaptive communication, and toxicity mitigation. Current steering methods, such as prompting-based and activation-based approaches, are widely used to guide model behavior. However, activation-based techniques require deep access to internal layers, while prompting-based steering often fails to provide consistent or fine-grained control. In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature. Our results show that statistically grounded logit steering can achieve large, consistent, and multi-task control gains: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1 improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ZPD Detector, a dynamic data selection framework inspired by educational theory to optimize training efficiency for large language models by aligning sample difficulty with model capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of high training costs and limited high-quality data by improving data selection methods, which currently rely on static criteria and ignore the evolving model-data relationship.

Method: ZPD Detector uses difficulty calibration, IRT-based model capability estimation, and a matching score to dynamically select informative samples at each learning stage.

Result: The framework enhances data utilization efficiency and offers insights into training strategy design.

Conclusion: ZPD Detector provides a scalable and reproducible solution to optimize training data selection for large language models.

Abstract: As the cost of training large language models continues to increase and high-quality training data become increasingly scarce, selecting high-value samples or synthesizing effective training data under limited data budgets has emerged as a critical research problem. Most existing data selection methods rely on static criteria, such as difficulty, uncertainty, or heuristics, and fail to model the evolving relationship between the model and the data. Inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), we propose ZPD Detector, a data selection framework that adopts a bidirectional perspective between models and data by explicitly modeling the alignment between sample difficulty and the model's current capability. ZPD Detector integrates difficulty calibration, model capability estimation based on Item Response Theory (IRT), and a capability-difficulty matching score to dynamically identify the most informative samples at each learning stage, improving data utilization efficiency; moreover, this dynamic matching strategy provides new insights into training strategy design. All code and data will be released after our work be accepted to support reproducible researc

TL;DR: Personalized LLMs can distort factual reasoning by aligning answers with user history rather than truth. FPPS mitigates this while preserving personalization, validated by PFQABench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of personalization-induced hallucinations in LLMs, which degrade factual reliability by favoring user history over objective truth.

Method: Introduces FPPS, a lightweight inference-time approach to mitigate distortions while keeping personalized behavior, and PFQABench for evaluation.

Result: FPPS significantly improves factual accuracy across various LLM backbones and personalization methods without compromising personalization.

Conclusion: FPPS effectively balances factual accuracy and personalization, offering a practical solution to mitigate distortions in personalized LLMs.

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) adapt model behavior to individual users to enhance user satisfaction, yet personalization can inadvertently distort factual reasoning. We show that when personalized LLMs face factual queries, there exists a phenomenon where the model generates answers aligned with a user's prior history rather than the objective truth, resulting in personalization-induced hallucinations that degrade factual reliability and may propagate incorrect beliefs, due to representational entanglement between personalization and factual representations. To address this issue, we propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that mitigates personalization-induced factual distortions while preserving personalized behavior. We further introduce PFQABench, the first benchmark designed to jointly evaluate factual and personalized question answering under personalization. Experiments across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods show that FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy while maintaining personalized performance.

*Qianen Zhang,Zeyu Yang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive actions (Sentence_Cut, Drop, Partial_Summarization, Pronominalization) for Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) within an LLM framework, improving translation quality and reducing delay compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional READ/WRITE actions in SiMT fail to meet real-time translation demands, prompting the need for adaptive actions to enhance restructuring, omission, and simplification while maintaining semantic fidelity.

Method: The study extends SiMT's action space with four adaptive actions, integrates them into an LLM framework, and uses action-aware prompting for training. A latency-aware TTS pipeline evaluates quality and word-level monotonicity.

Result: Experiments on ACL60/60 benchmarks show improvements in semantic metrics and reduced delay, especially when combining Drop and Sentence_Cut, balancing fluency and latency.

Conclusion: Enriching SiMT's action space with adaptive actions in LLMs offers a promising approach to closing the gap between human and machine interpretation.

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations under strict real-time constraints, which traditional policies with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space of SiMT with four adaptive actions: Sentence_Cut, Drop, Partial_Summarization and Pronominalization, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We adapt these actions in a large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60 English-Chinese, English-German and English-Japanese benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves semantic metrics and achieves lower delay compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines. Notably, combining Drop and Sentence_Cut leads to consistent improvements in the balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

TL;DR: The paper addresses poor confidence calibration in retrieval-augmented LLMs due to noisy contexts, proposing NAACL Rules and a framework to mitigate overconfidence, showing significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate confidence assessment is crucial for deploying LLMs in critical factual domains, but retrieval-augmented settings suffer from calibration issues caused by noisy contexts.

Method: The authors propose NAACL Rules for principled calibration under noise and develop NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework, using supervised fine-tuning on 2K HotpotQA examples.

Result: NAACL improves ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain, demonstrating effective mitigation of overconfidence.

Conclusion: NAACL bridges retrieval noise and verbal calibration, enhancing both accuracy and epistemic reliability in LLMs.

Abstract: Accurately assessing model confidence is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in mission-critical factual domains. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain. By bridging the gap between retrieval noise and verbal calibration, NAACL paves the way for both accurate and epistemically reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the innate translation abilities of LLMs, identifying 'translation initiation' features using SAEs and a PCA-based metric. These features are crucial for translation, and manipulating them affects output quality. The insights are used to improve data selection for fine-tuning, enhancing efficiency and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms behind LLMs' innate translation capabilities and leverage these insights for improving model robustness and efficiency.

Method: Uses Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and a PCA-based consistency metric to identify and validate 'translation initiation' features. Applies causal interventions to confirm their role and proposes a data selection strategy for fine-tuning.

Result: Identifies key translation features; demonstrates their role through interventions. Improves data efficiency and reduces hallucinations in fine-tuning. Shows mechanisms transfer to larger models.

Conclusion: Decodes core translation mechanisms in LLMs, providing a framework for leveraging internal features to enhance model performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit strong translation abilities, even without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models.

TL;DR: RetMask boosts long-context LLM performance by masking retrieval heads, showing +2.28 points on HELMET for Llama-3.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the unexplored role of retrieval heads in enhancing long-context capabilities of LLMs.

Method: Proposes RetMask, contrasting normal outputs with ablated outputs where retrieval heads are masked.

Result: +2.28 points on HELMET (128K) for Llama-3.1, +70% citation generation, +32% re-ranking, with general task performance preserved.

Conclusion: Retrieval head organization impacts effectiveness; concentrated patterns yield strong gains, distributed patterns show limited improvement.

Abstract: Advances in mechanistic interpretability have identified special attention heads, known as retrieval heads, that are responsible for retrieving information from the context. However, the role of these retrieval heads in improving model performance remains unexplored. This work investigates whether retrieval heads can be leveraged to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we propose RetMask, a method that generates training signals by contrasting normal model outputs with those from an ablated variant in which the retrieval heads are masked. This mechanism-based approach achieves substantial improvements: +2.28 points on HELMET at 128K for Llama-3.1, with +70% gains on generation with citation and +32% on passage re-ranking, while preserving performance on general tasks. Experiments across three model families reveal that the effectiveness depends on retrieval head organization: models with concentrated patterns of retrieval heads respond strongly, while those with distributed patterns show limited gains. This mechanistic relationship validates the function of retrieval heads and demonstrates that mechanistic insights can be transformed into performance enhancements.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an anytime reasoning framework and the Anytime Index metric to optimize LLM performance under limited computation budgets, along with a self-improvement method for better intermediate solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of LLMs delivering practical partial solutions quickly under constrained reasoning budgets, which is crucial for real-world tasks like trip planning.

Method: Proposes an anytime reasoning framework and the Anytime Index metric. Introduces an inference-time self-improvement method using LLM-synthesized preference data.

Result: Experiments on datasets like NaturalPlan, AIME, and GPQA show improved reasoning quality and efficiency across models including Grok-3, GPT-4.1/4o, and LLaMA.

Conclusion: The framework and self-improvement method enhance LLM performance under budget constraints, making them more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: We study the reasoning behavior of large language models (LLMs) under limited computation budgets. In such settings, producing useful partial solutions quickly is often more practical than exhaustive reasoning, which incurs high inference costs. Many real-world tasks, such as trip planning, require models to deliver the best possible output within a fixed reasoning budget. We introduce an anytime reasoning framework and the Anytime Index, a metric that quantifies how effectively solution quality improves as reasoning tokens increase. To further enhance efficiency, we propose an inference-time self-improvement method using LLM-synthesized preference data, where models learn from their own reasoning comparisons to produce better intermediate solutions. Experiments on NaturalPlan (Trip), AIME, and GPQA datasets show consistent gains across Grok-3, GPT-oss, GPT-4.1/4o, and LLaMA models, improving both reasoning quality and efficiency under budget constraints.

TL;DR: The paper addresses catastrophic collapse in sequential knowledge editing of large language models by analyzing dominant singular directions and proposing REVIVE to stabilize edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the degradation of general abilities in models undergoing repeated knowledge edits.

Method: Spectral analysis of weight matrices and the REVIVE framework, which preserves dominant singular subspaces.

Result: REVIVE improves editing efficacy and maintains general abilities even after extensive sequential edits.

Conclusion: Dominant singular directions are key to model stability, and REVIVE offers an effective solution for sequential knowledge editing.

Abstract: Sequential knowledge editing in large language models often causes catastrophic collapse of the model's general abilities, especially for parameter-modifying methods. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that REVIVE consistently improves editing efficacy while substantially preserving general abilities under long-horizon sequential editing, including extreme settings with up to 20,000 edits.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoG is a training-free framework combining intuitive and analytical processes to enhance LLMs' reasoning reliability using KGs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability challenges in LLMs like hallucinations by leveraging KGs while overcoming cognitive rigidity and reasoning stagnation.

Method: Combines Relational Blueprint Guidance (fast, intuitive) and Failure-Aware Refinement (prudent, analytical) modules inspired by Dual-Process Theory.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and efficiency on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoG effectively stabilizes LLM reasoning against noise and stagnation, enhancing reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities but often grapple with reliability challenges like hallucinations. While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that CoG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: To develop a specialized CNN architecture that efficiently classifies proper names by language and entity type while reducing computational costs compared to large pre-trained models like XLM-RoBERTa.

Method: The model uses parallel convolution branches with depthwise-separable operations and hierarchical classification to process names efficiently on CPU hardware.

Result: Onomas-CNN X achieves 92.1% accuracy, processes 2,813 names per second on a single CPU core (46x faster than XLM-RoBERTa), and reduces energy consumption by a factor of 46.

Conclusion: Specialized CNN architectures can compete with large pre-trained models for focused NLP tasks when sufficient training data is available, offering significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: We present a convolutional neural network approach for classifying proper names by language and entity type. Our model, Onomas-CNN X, combines parallel convolution branches with depthwise-separable operations and hierarchical classification to process names efficiently on CPU hardware. We evaluate the architecture on a large multilingual dataset covering 104 languages and four entity types (person, organization, location, other). Onomas-CNN X achieves 92.1% accuracy while processing 2,813 names per second on a single CPU core - 46 times faster than fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa with comparable accuracy. The model reduces energy consumption by a factor of 46 compared to transformer baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that specialized CNN architectures remain competitive with large pre-trained models for focused NLP tasks when sufficient training data exists.

TL;DR: Integrity Shield is a document-layer watermarking system that embeds hidden watermarks in PDF exams to prevent LLMs from answering them, achieving high prevention and detection rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about academic integrity and grade reliability due to LLMs solving exams directly from PDFs.

Method: Embedding schema-aware, item-level watermarks into PDFs without altering their appearance.

Result: Achieves 91-94% exam-level blocking and 89-93% signature retrieval across four commercial LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrity Shield effectively safeguards exams from LLM misuse while maintaining usability for instructors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can now solve entire exams directly from uploaded PDF assessments, raising urgent concerns about academic integrity and the reliability of grades and credentials. Existing watermarking techniques either operate at the token level or assume control over the model's decoding process, making them ineffective when students query proprietary black-box systems with instructor-provided documents. We present Integrity Shield, a document-layer watermarking system that embeds schema-aware, item-level watermarks into assessment PDFs while keeping their human-visible appearance unchanged. These watermarks consistently prevent MLLMs from answering shielded exam PDFs and encode stable, item-level signatures that can be reliably recovered from model or student responses. Across 30 exams spanning STEM, humanities, and medical reasoning, Integrity Shield achieves exceptionally high prevention (91-94% exam-level blocking) and strong detection reliability (89-93% signature retrieval) across four commercial MLLMs. Our demo showcases an interactive interface where instructors upload an exam, preview watermark behavior, and inspect pre/post AI performance & authorship evidence.

TL;DR: CLASSLA-web 2.0 expands South Slavic language corpora with 17B words and adds topic labels, but faces content quality issues due to machine-generated sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance text collection for less-resourced South Slavic languages via continuous national top-level domain crawling.

Method: Established iterative crawling infrastructure for South Slavic webs, resulting in CLASSLA-web 2.0 with expanded data and automatic topic annotation.

Result: Produced 17B-word corpora across seven languages; only 20% overlaps with CLASSLA-web 1.0, but quality degrades due to machine-generated content.

Conclusion: Continuous crawling yields new content but highlights challenges in maintaining quality amid increasing machine-generated texts.

Abstract: Crawling national top-level domains has proven to be highly effective for collecting texts in less-resourced languages. This approach has been recently used for South Slavic languages and resulted in the largest general corpora for this language group: the CLASSLA-web 1.0 corpora. Building on this success, we established a continuous crawling infrastructure for iterative national top-level domain crawling across South Slavic and related webs. We present the first outcome of this crawling infrastructure - the CLASSLA-web 2.0 corpus collection, with substantially larger web corpora containing 17.0 billion words in 38.1 million texts in seven languages: Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serbian, and Slovenian. In addition to genre categories, the new version is also automatically annotated with topic labels. Comparing CLASSLA-web 2.0 with its predecessor reveals that only one-fifth of the texts overlap, showing that re-crawling after just two years yields largely new content. However, while the new web crawls bring growing gains, we also notice growing pains - a manual inspection of top domains reveals a visible degradation of web content, as machine-generated sites now contribute a significant portion of texts.

Motivation: The long-tail distribution of relation types and scarce training examples for many relations in document-level relation extraction pose significant challenges.

Method: DOREMI is an iterative framework that actively selects the most informative examples for manual annotation to enhance underrepresented relations. It avoids reliance on noisy data or heuristic denoising.

Result: DOREMI effectively mitigates long-tail biases and can be applied to any existing DocRE model, improving generalization on rare relations.

Conclusion: DOREMI offers a scalable and efficient solution for document-level relation extraction by targeting underrepresented relations through minimal manual annotations.

Abstract: Document-Level Relation Extraction (DocRE) presents significant challenges due to its reliance on cross-sentence context and the long-tail distribution of relation types, where many relations have scarce training examples. In this work, we introduce DOcument-level Relation Extraction optiMizing the long taIl (DOREMI), an iterative framework that enhances underrepresented relations through minimal yet targeted manual annotations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on large-scale noisy data or heuristic denoising, DOREMI actively selects the most informative examples to improve training efficiency and robustness. DOREMI can be applied to any existing DocRE model and is effective at mitigating long-tail biases, offering a scalable solution to improve generalization on rare relations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the parallelism and efficiency of decoding in masked diffusion language models while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses a TraceRL-based training curriculum (T$^\star$) to progressively scale block sizes, transitioning from small to larger blocks.

Result: Achieves higher-parallelism decoding with minimal performance degradation on math reasoning benchmarks and can converge to an alternative decoding schedule.

Conclusion: T$^\star$ effectively balances performance and efficiency in masked diffusion language models.

Abstract: We present T$^\star$, a simple \textsc{TraceRL}-based training curriculum for progressive block-size scaling in masked diffusion language models (MDMs). Starting from an AR-initialized small-block MDM, T$^\star$~transitions smoothly to larger blocks, enabling higher-parallelism decoding with minimal performance degradation on math reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, further analysis suggests that T$^\star$~can converge to an alternative decoding schedule $\hat{\rm S}$ that achieves comparable performance.

TL;DR: MultiCaption is a new dataset for detecting contradictions in visual claims across 64 languages, offering a resource for misinformation detection in multimodal, multilingual contexts. Experiments show it's more challenging than standard tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online disinformation is growing, but current automated fact-checking methods lack datasets reflecting real-world complexities, especially in multilingual and multimodal environments.

Method: Created MultiCaption, a dataset of 11,088 visual claims in 64 languages, labeled for contradictions. Evaluated using transformer-based architectures, NLI models, and LLMs.

Result: MultiCaption is more challenging than standard NLI tasks, requiring task-specific finetuning. Multilingual training and testing show promise for fact-checking without machine translation.

Conclusion: MultiCaption addresses a critical gap in misinformation detection, providing a robust resource for future research in multilingual and multimodal fact-checking.

Abstract: Online disinformation poses an escalating threat to society, driven increasingly by the rapid spread of misleading content across both multimedia and multilingual platforms. While automated fact-checking methods have advanced in recent years, their effectiveness remains constrained by the scarcity of datasets that reflect these real-world complexities. To address this gap, we first present MultiCaption, a new dataset specifically designed for detecting contradictions in visual claims. Pairs of claims referring to the same image or video were labeled through multiple strategies to determine whether they contradict each other. The resulting dataset comprises 11,088 visual claims in 64 languages, offering a unique resource for building and evaluating misinformation-detection systems in truly multimodal and multilingual environments. We then provide comprehensive experiments using transformer-based architectures, natural language inference models, and large language models, establishing strong baselines for future research. The results show that MultiCaption is more challenging than standard NLI tasks, requiring task-specific finetuning for strong performance. Moreover, the gains from multilingual training and testing highlight the dataset's potential for building effective multilingual fact-checking pipelines without relying on machine translation.

*Shaoyang Xu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Controlling the language of thought in LLMs enhances output diversity, with non-English languages yielding greater diversity. Mixed-language sampling further improves diversity through compositional effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how controlling the language of thought (thinking language) in LLMs can structurally increase output diversity and creativity, benefiting pluralistic alignment scenarios.

Method: Studied Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling strategies, evaluating output diversity in English while varying the thinking language.

Result: Switching thinking languages to non-English increases diversity, with languages farther from English yielding larger gains. Mixed-language sampling further enhances diversity through compositional effects.

Conclusion: Diversifying the language of thought expands LLM output diversity, offering practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios.

Abstract: Output diversity is crucial for Large Language Models as it underpins pluralism and creativity. In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity. Our preliminary study shows that different thinking languages occupy distinct regions in a model's thinking space. Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs.

Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs generating factually incorrect responses in knowledge-intensive applications.

Method: Introduces FactCorrector, a post-hoc correction method that uses structured feedback to correct factual errors without retraining.

Result: Significantly improves factual precision while maintaining relevance, outperforming baselines on VELI5 and other datasets.

Conclusion: FactCorrector is an effective solution for correcting factual errors in LLM responses across domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in knowledge-intensive applications but often generate factually incorrect responses. A promising approach to rectify these flaws is correcting LLMs using feedback. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce FactCorrector, a new post-hoc correction method that adapts across domains without retraining and leverages structured feedback about the factuality of the original response to generate a correction. To support rigorous evaluations of factuality correction methods, we also develop the VELI5 benchmark, a novel dataset containing systematically injected factual errors and ground-truth corrections. Experiments on VELI5 and several popular long-form factuality datasets show that the FactCorrector approach significantly improves factual precision while preserving relevance, outperforming strong baselines. We release our code at https://ibm.biz/factcorrector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can produce ambiguous examples in data augmentation for intent detection, posing challenges for classification tasks, especially in low-resource scenarios.

Method: Developed DDAIR, which employs Sentence Transformers to identify ambiguous synthetic examples and introduces an iterative re-generation method to reduce ambiguities.

Result: Sentence embeddings effectively help generate less ambiguous examples, enhancing classification performance, particularly for loosely defined intents.

Conclusion: DDAIR successfully mitigates ambiguities in LLM-generated data and shows promise for improving intent recognition in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective for data augmentation in classification tasks like intent detection. In some cases, they inadvertently produce examples that are ambiguous with regard to untargeted classes. We present DDAIR (Disambiguated Data Augmentation for Intent Recognition) to mitigate this problem. We use Sentence Transformers to detect ambiguous class-guided augmented examples generated by LLMs for intent recognition in low-resource scenarios. We identify synthetic examples that are semantically more similar to another intent than to their target one. We also provide an iterative re-generation method to mitigate such ambiguities. Our findings show that sentence embeddings effectively help to (re)generate less ambiguous examples, and suggest promising potential to improve classification performance in scenarios where intents are loosely or broadly defined.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current iterative methods for multi-hop QA struggle with reasoning coherence due to inaccurate query decomposition and error propagation.

Method: Proposes RT-RAG, which decomposes questions into reasoning trees with structured entity analysis and consensus-based tree selection, followed by bottom-up traversal for evidence collection.

Result: RT-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.0% F1 and 6.0% EM.

Conclusion: RT-RAG is effective for complex multi-hop QA, addressing key challenges in reasoning coherence and error propagation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant effectiveness in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex multi-hop question answering (QA). For multi-hop QA tasks, current iterative approaches predominantly rely on LLMs to self-guide and plan multi-step exploration paths during retrieval, leading to substantial challenges in maintaining reasoning coherence across steps from inaccurate query decomposition and error propagation. To address these issues, we introduce Reasoning Tree Guided RAG (RT-RAG), a novel hierarchical framework for complex multi-hop QA. RT-RAG systematically decomposes multi-hop questions into explicit reasoning trees, minimizing inaccurate decomposition through structured entity analysis and consensus-based tree selection that clearly separates core queries, known entities, and unknown entities. Subsequently, a bottom-up traversal strategy employs iterative query rewriting and refinement to collect high-quality evidence, thereby mitigating error propagation. Comprehensive experiments show that RT-RAG substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.0% F1 and 6.0% EM, demonstrating the effectiveness of RT-RAG in complex multi-hop QA.

TL;DR: The paper proposes multi-task learning (MTL) with small decoder-only LLMs for automated fact-checking, achieving significant improvements over zero-/few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large proprietary LLMs for automated fact-checking are unsustainable due to closed weights and high costs. Smaller open-weight models fine-tuned for individual tasks are costly. MTL offers a more efficient alternative.

Method: Three MTL strategies (classification heads, causal language modeling heads, instruction-tuning) are explored using small decoder-only LLMs (e.g., Qwen3-4b). Evaluated across model sizes, task orders, and non-LLM baselines.

Result: MTL models achieve up to 44%, 54%, and 31% relative gains for claim detection, evidence re-ranking, and stance detection, respectively, over zero-/few-shot settings.

Conclusion: MTL with small LLMs is efficient for automated fact-checking, though not universally surpassing single-task baselines. Practical guidelines are provided for practitioners.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping automated fact-checking (AFC) by enabling unified, end-to-end verification pipelines rather than isolated components. While large proprietary models achieve strong performance, their closed weights, complexity, and high costs limit sustainability. Fine-tuning smaller open weight models for individual AFC tasks can help but requires multiple specialized models resulting in high costs. We propose \textbf{multi-task learning (MTL)} as a more efficient alternative that fine-tunes a single model to perform claim detection, evidence ranking, and stance detection jointly. Using small decoder-only LLMs (e.g., Qwen3-4b), we explore three MTL strategies: classification heads, causal language modeling heads, and instruction-tuning, and evaluate them across model sizes, task orders, and standard non-LLM baselines. While multitask models do not universally surpass single-task baselines, they yield substantial improvements, achieving up to \textbf{44\%}, \textbf{54\%}, and \textbf{31\%} relative gains for claim detection, evidence re-ranking, and stance detection, respectively, over zero-/few-shot settings. Finally, we also provide practical, empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners apply MTL with LLMs for automated fact-checking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIAs rely on inaccessible model internals or perform poorly in black-box settings, highlighting the need for a text-only solution.

Method: SimMIA uses an advanced sampling strategy and scoring mechanism tailored for black-box scenarios.

Result: SimMIA achieves state-of-the-art performance, even rivaling methods that use internal model information.

Conclusion: SimMIA addresses limitations of current MIAs and sets a new benchmark for text-only black-box attacks.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) act as a crucial auditing tool for the opaque training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing techniques predominantly rely on inaccessible model internals (e.g., logits) or suffer from poor generalization across domains in strict black-box settings where only generated text is available. In this work, we propose SimMIA, a robust MIA framework tailored for this text-only regime by leveraging an advanced sampling strategy and scoring mechanism. Furthermore, we present WikiMIA-25, a new benchmark curated to evaluate MIA performance on modern proprietary LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that SimMIA achieves state-of-the-art results in the black-box setting, rivaling baselines that exploit internal model information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance naturalness and usability of spoken conversational systems by enabling dynamic adaptation to context through customizable conversational behavior.

Method: Freeze the audio encoder and finetune only the language model, using just 2,000 hours of data and a single-stage training protocol.

Result: The model can control speaker voice, topic, conversational behavior (e.g., backchanneling), and dialogue initiation via instructions.

Conclusion: The model and training code will be released to advance reproducible research on controllable full-duplex speech systems.

Abstract: Spoken conversational systems require more than accurate speech generation to have human-like conversations: to feel natural and engaging, they must produce conversational behaviour that adapts dynamically to the context. Current spoken conversational systems, however, rarely allow such customization, limiting their naturalness and usability. In this work, we present the first open, instruction-following full-duplex conversational speech model that can be trained efficiently under typical academic resource constraints. By keeping the audio encoder frozen and finetuning only the language model, our model requires just 2,000 hours of data, without relying on large-scale pretraining or multi-stage optimization. The model can follow explicit instructions to control speaker voice, conversation topic, conversational behaviour (e.g., backchanneling and interruptions), and dialogue initiation. We propose a single-stage training protocol and systematically analyze design choices. Both the model and training code will be released to enable reproducible research on controllable full-duplex speech systems.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs in competitive programming, emphasizing natural-language editorials for problem-solving and implementation. It finds gold editorials improve solve rates but reveal persistent gaps in algorithmic specification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the conflation of algorithmic reasoning and implementation in LLM evaluations for competitive programming, proposing natural-language editorials as a better metric.

Method: Uses gold editorials and expert annotations to evaluate LLMs, introducing a dataset with ICPC-style problems and test suites.

Result: Gold editorials boost solve rates, but LLMs struggle with implementation and algorithmic correctness, highlighting a problem-solving bottleneck.

Conclusion: Future benchmarks should separate problem-solving from implementation, leveraging editorials for scalable and accurate evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly succeed on competitive programming problems, yet existing evaluations conflate algorithmic reasoning with code-level implementation. We argue that competitive programming is fundamentally a problem-solving task and propose centering natural-language editorials in both solution generation and evaluation. Generating an editorial prior to code improves solve rates for some LLMs, with substantially larger gains when using expertly written gold editorials. However, even with gold editorials, models continue to struggle with implementation, while the gap between generated and gold editorials reveals a persistent problem-solving bottleneck in specifying correct and complete algorithms. Beyond pass/fail metrics, we diagnose reasoning errors by comparing model-generated editorials to gold standards using expert annotations and validate an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation. We introduce a dataset of 83 ICPC-style problems with gold editorials and full test suites, and evaluate 19 LLMs, arguing that future benchmarks should explicitly separate problem solving from implementation.

Conclusion: NCoTS outperforms standard models by optimizing correctness and computational cost.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has significantly enhanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models. Unfortunately, current models generate reasoning steps sequentially without foresight, often becoming trapped in suboptimal reasoning paths with redundant steps. In contrast, we introduce Neural Chain-of-Thought Search (NCoTS), a framework that reformulates reasoning as a dynamic search for the optimal thinking strategy. By quantitatively characterizing the solution space, we reveal the existence of sparse superior reasoning paths that are simultaneously more accurate and concise than standard outputs. Our method actively navigates towards these paths by evaluating candidate reasoning operators using a dual-factor heuristic that optimizes for both correctness and computational cost. Consequently, NCoTS achieves a Pareto improvement across diverse reasoning benchmarks, boosting accuracy by over 3.5% while reducing generation length by over 22%.

### [80] [How Much Would a Clinician Edit This Draft? Evaluating LLM Alignment for Patient Message Response Drafting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11344)
*Parker Seegmiller,Joseph Gatto,Sarah E. Greer,Ganza Belise Isingizwe,Rohan Ray,Timothy E. Burdick,Sarah Masud Preum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show potential in drafting responses to patient messages, but aligning them with clinicians' preferences remains uncertain. A new taxonomy and evaluation framework reveal challenges, especially in eliciting patient information. Adaptation strategies help but individual clinician preferences are key for reliable use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can effectively draft patient portal message responses while saving clinicians time and effort, and to understand alignment challenges with clinician preferences.

Method: Developed a taxonomy for clinician responses, created an evaluation framework for editing load, and tested LLMs using thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, fine-tuning, and preference optimization.

Result: LLMs perform well in some thematic elements but struggle with question-asking themes. Adaptation strategies improve alignment, but epistemic uncertainty persists.

Conclusion: Aligning LLMs with clinician preferences is essential for reliable integration into clinical workflows, requiring theme-driven adaptation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in drafting responses to patient portal messages, yet their integration into clinical workflows raises various concerns, including whether they would actually save clinicians time and effort in their portal workload. We investigate LLM alignment with individual clinicians through a comprehensive evaluation of the patient message response drafting task. We develop a novel taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses and propose a novel evaluation framework for assessing clinician editing load of LLM-drafted responses at both content and theme levels. We release an expert-annotated dataset and conduct large-scale evaluations of local and commercial LLMs using various adaptation techniques including thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Our results reveal substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. While LLMs demonstrate capability in drafting certain thematic elements, they struggle with clinician-aligned generation in other themes, particularly question asking to elicit further information from patients. Theme-driven adaptation strategies yield improvements across most themes. Our findings underscore the necessity of adapting LLMs to individual clinician preferences to enable reliable and responsible use in patient-clinician communication workflows.

### [81] [Reward Modeling for Scientific Writing Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11374)
*Furkan Şahinuç,Subhabrata Dutta,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in evaluating scientific writing using LLM-based models and proposes a cost-efficient, two-stage training framework for improved evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific writing evaluation is complex and lacks reliable models that can adapt to diverse, task-specific requirements without costly fine-tuning.

Method: Introduces a two-stage training framework: first optimizes scientific evaluation preferences, then refines reasoning capabilities. Uses multi-aspect evaluation and joint training across tasks.

Result: The proposed models significantly improve evaluation accuracy, generalize across tasks, and do not require task-specific retraining.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust, adaptable, and reusable scientific writing evaluation, overcoming limitations of existing LLM-based judges.

Abstract: Scientific writing is an expert-domain task that demands deep domain knowledge, task-specific requirements and reasoning capabilities that leverage the domain knowledge to satisfy the task specifications. While scientific text generation has been widely studied, its evaluation remains a challenging and open problem. It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation. We introduce a two-stage training framework that initially optimizes scientific evaluation preferences and then refines reasoning capabilities. Our multi-aspect evaluation design and joint training across diverse tasks enable fine-grained assessment and robustness to dynamic criteria and scoring rubrics. Experimental analysis shows that our training regime strongly improves LLM-based scientific writing evaluation. Our models generalize effectively across tasks and to previously unseen scientific writing evaluation settings, allowing a single trained evaluator to be reused without task-specific retraining.

*Morgane Hoffmann,Emma Jouffroy,Warren Jouanneau,Marc Palyart,Charles Pebereau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how LLMs weigh recruitment criteria using economic methods, revealing prioritization of productivity signals and nuanced demographic impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand LLM decision logic in recruitment, assessing alignment with economic principles, recruiter preferences, and societal norms.

Method: A framework uses synthetic datasets from freelance profiles and project descriptions, employing a factorial design to analyze LLM criteria weighting.

Result: The LLM prioritizes productivity signals like skills but interprets some features beyond explicit matching value, with nuanced demographic impacts.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLM recruitment biases and suggests methodologies for comparing model and human decision alignment.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in recruitment applications, where decisions require reasoning over unstructured text, balancing multiple criteria, and inferring fit and competence from indirect productivity signals. Yet, it is still uncertain how LLMs assign importance to each attribute and whether such assignments are in line with economic principles, recruiter preferences or broader societal norms. We propose a framework to evaluate an LLM's decision logic in recruitment, by drawing on established economic methodologies for analyzing human hiring behavior. We build synthetic datasets from real freelancer profiles and project descriptions from a major European online freelance marketplace and apply a full factorial design to estimate how a LLM weighs different match-relevant criteria when evaluating freelancer-project fit. We identify which attributes the LLM prioritizes and analyze how these weights vary across project contexts and demographic subgroups. Finally, we explain how a comparable experimental setup could be implemented with human recruiters to assess alignment between model and human decisions. Our findings reveal that the LLM weighs core productivity signals, such as skills and experience, but interprets certain features beyond their explicit matching value. While showing minimal average discrimination against minority groups, intersectional effects reveal that productivity signals carry different weights between demographic groups.

### [83] [Relational Linearity is a Predictor of Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11429)
*Yuetian Lu,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores hallucination in medium-size LLMs like Gemma-7B-IT, focusing on synthetic entities. It hypothesizes that linear relations (stored abstractly) cause more hallucinations than nonlinear ones (stored directly). Using SyntHal dataset and Δcos, it finds a strong correlation between relational linearity and hallucination rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs hallucinate answers for synthetic questions and whether the linearity of relations affects hallucination rates.

Method: Created SyntHal dataset (6000 synthetic entities for six relations), measured hallucination rates, and relational linearity using Δcos across four models.

Result: Found strong correlation (r ∈ [.78,.82]) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, supporting the hypothesis.

Conclusion: Relational storage type (linear vs. nonlinear) impacts LLMs' ability to self-assess knowledge, suggesting new directions for mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: Hallucination is a central failure mode in large language models (LLMs). We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: "Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $Δ\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge. This finding has implications for how to manage hallucination behavior and suggests new research directions for improving the representation of factual knowledge in LLMs.

### [84] [The unreasonable effectiveness of pattern matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11432)
*Gary Lupyan,Blaise Agüera y Arcas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can interpret nonsense-filled 'Jabberwocky' language, translating it to meaningful sentences, highlighting their reliance on pattern-matching rather than mere mimicry or database-like behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify how LLMs process language by testing their ability to derive meaning from structurally intact but semantically nonsensical sentences.

Method: Researchers replaced content words in sentences with nonsense strings and evaluated LLMs' ability to translate these into coherent phrases.

Result: LLMs successfully translated 'Jabberwocky' sentences into meaningful language, demonstrating their capacity to infer meaning from structural patterns.

Conclusion: Pattern-matching is a fundamental aspect of LLMs' intelligence, not just mimicry or database retrieval, underscoring its role in understanding language.

Abstract: We report on an astonishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to make sense of "Jabberwocky" language in which most or all content words have been randomly replaced by nonsense strings, e.g., translating "He dwushed a ghanc zawk" to "He dragged a spare chair". This result addresses ongoing controversies regarding how to best think of what LLMs are doing: are they a language mimic, a database, a blurry version of the Web? The ability of LLMs to recover meaning from structural patterns speaks to the unreasonable effectiveness of pattern-matching. Pattern-matching is not an alternative to "real" intelligence, but rather a key ingredient.

TL;DR: HORSE introduces Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual Spread for stable LLM editing, reducing noisy gradients and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety concerns in LLMs by improving model editing efficiency and stability.

Method: Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual Spread (HORSE) to reduce noisy gradients.

Result: Maintains precise massive editing across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: HORSE offers a computationally efficient and stable alternative for LLM editing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance across various domains, yet they face critical safety concerns. Model editing has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate these issues. Existing model editing methods often focus on optimizing an information matrix that blends new and old knowledge. While effective, these approaches can be computationally expensive and may cause conflicts. In contrast, we shift our attention to Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual SprEad of the information matrix, which reduces noisy gradients and enables more stable edits from a different perspective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method HORSE through a clear theoretical comparison with several popular methods and extensive experiments conducted on two datasets across multiple LLMs. The results show that HORSE maintains precise massive editing across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges arise in RAG systems due to distribution shifts in specialized domains, leading to suboptimal generalization.

Method: TTARAG dynamically updates the language model's parameters during inference, predicting retrieved content for automatic domain adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments show TTARAG outperforms baseline RAG systems across six specialized domains.

Conclusion: TTARAG effectively enhances RAG systems' performance in specialized domains through dynamic parameter updates.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing large language models' question-answering capabilities through the integration of external knowledge. However, when adapting RAG systems to specialized domains, challenges arise from distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance. In this work, we propose TTARAG, a test-time adaptation method that dynamically updates the language model's parameters during inference to improve RAG system performance in specialized domains. Our method introduces a simple yet effective approach where the model learns to predict retrieved content, enabling automatic parameter adjustment to the target domain. Through extensive experiments across six specialized domains, we demonstrate that TTARAG achieves substantial performance improvements over baseline RAG systems.

*Vanshali Sharma,Andrea Mia Bejar,Gorkem Durak,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CTest-Metric, a unified framework to evaluate the clinical feasibility of metrics for radiology report generation, addressing gaps in current assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for radiology report generation lack robustness and clinical applicability, necessitating a domain-specific evaluation framework.

Method: CTest-Metric includes three modules: Writing Style Generalizability (LLM-based rephrasing), Synthetic Error Injection (graded severities), and Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (clinician ratings). Eight metrics across seven LLMs were tested.

Result: Lexical metrics are sensitive to style variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments, while CRG shows negative correlation. BERTScore-F1 is least affected by factual errors.

Conclusion: CTest-Metric provides a reproducible benchmark for evaluating and improving metrics in radiology report generation, with data and code released for future research.

Abstract: In the generative AI era, where even critical medical tasks are increasingly automated, radiology report generation (RRG) continues to rely on suboptimal metrics for quality assessment. Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 "disagreement" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection. We will release the framework, code, and allowable portion of the anonymized evaluation data (rephrased/error-injected CT reports), to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and future metric development.

### [88] [Do explanations generalize across large reasoning models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11517)
*Koyena Pal,David Bau,Chandan Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether explanations (CoT) from Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generalize across models, finding they often improve consistency and correlate with human preferences. It proposes a sentence-level ensembling method for better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LRM-generated explanations (CoT) capture general problem patterns or are model-specific, which is vital for AI applications like science discovery.

Method: Evaluates generalizability by testing if explanations from one LRM influence others similarly. Analyzes conditions for consistent answers and introduces sentence-level ensembling.

Result: CoT explanations often generalize (increasing consistency) and correlate with human preferences and reinforcement learning outcomes. Ensembling improves consistency further.

Conclusion: Caution is advised when using LRM explanations for insights. The study provides a framework to assess explanation generalization and suggests practical improvements.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) produce a textual chain of thought (CoT) in the process of solving a problem, which serves as a potentially powerful tool to understand the problem by surfacing a human-readable, natural-language explanation. However, it is unclear whether these explanations generalize, i.e. whether they capture general patterns about the underlying problem rather than patterns which are esoteric to the LRM. This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency. Taken together, these results prescribe caution when using LRM explanations to yield new insights and outline a framework for characterizing LRM explanation generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tokenization varies significantly across models and domains, challenging naive assumptions about token counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify misunderstandings about tokenization in LLMs and its inconsistencies across models and text domains.

Method: Comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization across different textual data distributions.

Result: Token lengths are more variable than commonly assumed, refuting simplistic heuristics.

Conclusion: The study provides clearer insights into tokenization, aiding better comparisons and interpretations in LLMs.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are increasingly utilised across academia, society and industry. A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data. Our analysis challenges commonly held heuristics about token lengths, finding them to be overly simplistic. We hope the insights of our study add clarity and intuition toward tokenization in contemporary LLMs.

TL;DR: Joint optimization of UAV trajectories and bandwidth allocation for energy-efficient data collection using asynchronous multi-agent learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of solutions for asynchronous environments in UAV cooperative data collection, focusing on energy efficiency.

Method: Formulates the problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process and introduces an asynchronous multi-agent learning algorithm.

Result: Outperforms other learning-based and heuristic methods in energy efficiency and mission completion time, with robust policies under varying conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively optimizes UAV operations in asynchronous settings, demonstrating superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: This paper addresses the joint optimization of trajectories and bandwidth allocation for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to enhance energy efficiency in the cooperative data collection problem. We focus on an important yet underestimated aspect of the system, where action synchronization across all UAVs is impossible. Since most existing learning-based solutions are not designed to learn in this asynchronous environment, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process and introduce an asynchronous multi-agent learning algorithm to learn UAVs' cooperative policies. Once the UAVs' trajectory policies are learned, the bandwidth allocation can be optimally solved based on local observations at each collection point. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other learning-based and heuristic baselines in terms of both energy efficiency and mission completion time. Additionally, the learned policies exhibit robustness under varying environmental conditions.

TL;DR: Small tool-augmented agents can outperform larger models on GAIA benchmark when using tools, while explicit thinking effects vary by configuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether smaller models with tool augmentation can compete with or surpass larger monolithic models on the GAIA benchmark.

Method: Utilized Qwen3 models (4B-32B) within an Agentic-Reasoning framework, testing effects of model scale, explicit thinking (no thinking, planner-only, full), and tool use (search, code, mind-map).

Result: Tool augmentation yielded the most significant and consistent improvements, enabling 4B models to outperform 32B models without tools. Explicit thinking performance varied, with planner-only aiding decomposition but full thinking often harming tool orchestration.

Conclusion: Tool use is highly effective for small models, while explicit thinking requires careful configuration to avoid destabilizing tool orchestration.

Abstract: This report studies whether small, tool-augmented agents can match or outperform larger monolithic models on the GAIA benchmark. Using Qwen3 models (4B-32B) within an adapted Agentic-Reasoning framework, we isolate the effects of model scale, explicit thinking (no thinking, planner-only, or full), and tool use (search, code, mind-map). Tool augmentation provides the largest and most consistent gains. Using tools, 4B models can outperform 32B models without tool access on GAIA in our experimental setup. In contrast, explicit thinking is highly configuration- and difficulty-dependent: planner-only thinking can improve decomposition and constraint tracking, while unrestricted full thinking often degrades performance by destabilizing tool orchestration, leading to skipped verification steps, excessive tool calls, non-termination, and output-format drift.

*Mathis Gerdes,Miranda C. N. Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces three families of analytic bijections (cubic rational, sinh, cubic polynomial) for normalizing flows, offering global smoothness and invertibility. It also proposes radial flows, a novel architecture, achieving stability and efficiency, validated on benchmarks and physics problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scalar bijections in normalizing flows compromise between expressivity, smoothness, and tractability. The goal is to develop globally smooth, invertible bijections that overcome these limitations and enable problem-specific designs.

Method: Three analytic bijection families are introduced: cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial. A novel radial flow architecture is proposed, transforming radial coordinates while preserving angular direction. Evaluations include 1D/2D benchmarks and physics applications.

Result: The new bijections outperform splines and affine baselines, matching coupling flows with fewer parameters. Radial flows show exceptional stability and interpretability, excelling in tasks with radial structure.

Conclusion: The introduced bijections and radial flows combine expressivity, smoothness, and tractability, offering versatile tools for normalizing flows, validated by superior performance on benchmarks and physics problems.

Abstract: A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\infty$), defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $φ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework (UOWQ) for optimizing both source weights and transfer quantities in multi-source transfer learning, proving that using all source samples with adjusted weights is optimal and validating results with real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address negative transfer in data-scarce scenarios by jointly optimizing source weights and transfer quantities, which existing methods often neglect.

Method: UOWQ formulates transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem using Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing closed-form solutions for single-source and convex optimization for multi-source cases.

Result: Theoretical proof that adjusted weights with all source samples are optimal; UOWQ outperforms baselines in experiments on DomainNet and Office-Home.

Conclusion: UOWQ is both theoretically justified and practically effective for improving transfer learning performance.

Abstract: Transfer learning plays a vital role in improving model performance in data-scarce scenarios. However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: Addressing the strict latency requirements of the HL-LHC Level-1 trigger system by exploring compact and interpretable Tensor Network alternatives to deep neural networks.

Method: Evaluation of Matrix Product States and Tree Tensor Networks using low-level jet constituent features, with post-training quantization for hardware efficiency.

Result: Achieved competitive performance comparable to deep learning classifiers, with sub-microsecond latency suitable for FPGA deployment.

Conclusion: Tensor Network models are viable for fast, resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments like real-time trigger systems.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of Tensor Network (TN) models $\unicode{x2013}$ Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tree Tensor Networks (TTN) $\unicode{x2013}$ for real-time jet tagging in high-energy physics, with a focus on low-latency deployment on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Motivated by the strict requirements of the HL-LHC Level-1 trigger system, we explore TNs as compact and interpretable alternatives to deep neural networks. Using low-level jet constituent features, our models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. We investigate post-training quantization to enable hardware-efficient implementations without degrading classification performance or latency. The best-performing models are synthesized to estimate FPGA resource usage, latency, and memory occupancy, demonstrating sub-microsecond latency and supporting the feasibility of online deployment in real-time trigger systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of TN-based models for fast and resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments.

TL;DR: A planner-guided multi-agent framework improves feature engineering efficiency by addressing dataset scarcity, integration challenges, and suboptimal human-AI collaboration, reducing cycles from three weeks to one day.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of code generation models in ML teams is hindered by lack of datasets, poor integration with team tools, and inefficient human-AI collaboration.

Method: A planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework generates code in steps, leveraging team environments and human feedback for reliability.

Result: The approach improves evaluation metrics by 38% and 150% over manual and unplanned workflows, and reduces feature engineering cycles significantly.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses real-world challenges, enhancing efficiency and alignment with team needs in feature engineering.

Abstract: Recent advances in code generation models have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for automating feature engineering, yet their adoption in real-world ML teams remains constrained by critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of datasets capturing the iterative and complex coding processes of production-level feature engineering, (ii) limited integration and personalization of widely used coding agents, such as CoPilot and Devin, with a team's unique tools, codebases, workflows, and practices, and (iii) suboptimal human-AI collaboration due to poorly timed or insufficient feedback. We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively.

### [96] [Mugi: Value Level Parallelism For Efficient LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10823)
*Daniel Price,Prabhu Vellaisamy,John Shen,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Value Level Parallelism (VLP) in LLMs, introducing a generalized VLP for nonlinear approximations, optimizing VLP for small-batch GEMMs, and designing the Mugi architecture for better performance, efficiency, and sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in transformer-based LLMs beyond activation-weight GEMM by leveraging VLP for improved accuracy, performance, and sustainability.

Method: Generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs, and design the Mugi architecture to integrate these innovations for full LLM workloads.

Result: Mugi achieves significant improvements: up to 45x and 668x in throughput and energy efficiency for nonlinear softmax, and 2.07x and 3.11x for LLMs. It also reduces carbon footprint by 1.45x (operational) and 1.48x (embodied).

Conclusion: VLP, particularly with the Mugi architecture, effectively enhances LLM performance, efficiency, and sustainability, proving its viability for complex operations beyond GEMM.

Abstract: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI co-pilot predicts user-preferred regions in human-in-the-loop Topology Optimization, reducing iterations and improving outcomes like manufacturability and buckling load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome computational bottlenecks and lack of interaction in Topology Optimization by integrating human intuition with AI predictions.

Method: Uses a U-Net-based image segmentation model trained on synthetic datasets to predict user-preferred regions for design modifications.

Result: AI co-pilot successfully predicts modification regions, improving manufacturability and increasing buckling load by 39% with minimal time overhead.

Conclusion: Integrating AI predictions enhances human-in-the-loop TO, reducing iterations and achieving better performance efficiently.

Abstract: Inverse design tools such as Topology Optimization (TO) can achieve new levels of improvement for high-performance engineered structures. However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO.

*Chutian Ma,Grigorii Pomazkin,Giacinto Paolo Saggese,Paul Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new scoring metric (forecast AC score) combining accuracy and temporal consistency for probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts, showing improved stability and accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting methods focus solely on accuracy, ignoring temporal consistency. The paper addresses this gap by balancing both criteria.

Method: The forecast AC score is developed and implemented as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models, tested on the M4 Hourly dataset.

Result: AC-optimized models reduce forecast volatility by 75% while maintaining or improving point forecast accuracy compared to maximum likelihood estimation.

Conclusion: The forecast AC score effectively balances accuracy and temporal consistency, enhancing forecast quality in probabilistic multi-horizon settings.

Abstract: Traditional time series forecasting methods optimize for accuracy alone. This objective neglects temporal consistency, in other words, how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. We introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score for short) for measuring the quality of probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts in a way that accounts for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. Our score additionally provides for user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements. As an example application, we implement the score as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models and evaluate it on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Our AC-optimized models achieve a 75\% reduction in forecast volatility for the same target timestamps while maintaining comparable or improved point forecast accuracy.

*Jeffrey Uhlmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gauge symmetry in deep neural networks with positively homogeneous nonlinearities and introduces a Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint method for invariant optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the lack of equivariance in standard gradient descent to gauge symmetry, leading to optimization inefficiencies.

Method: The authors propose replacing the Euclidean transpose with a Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint to ensure gauge-consistent steepest descent and backpropagation.

Result: The method provides a uniform and simple operator-level solution for invariant optimization across network components.

Conclusion: The UC adjoint approach effectively addresses gauge symmetry issues, improving optimization consistency in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks constructed from linear maps and positively homogeneous nonlinearities (e.g., ReLU) possess a fundamental gauge symmetry: the network function is invariant to node-wise diagonal rescalings. However, standard gradient descent is not equivariant to this symmetry, causing optimization trajectories to depend heavily on arbitrary parameterizations. Prior work has proposed rescaling-invariant optimization schemes for positively homogeneous networks (e.g., path-based or path-space updates). Our contribution is complementary: we formulate the invariance requirement at the level of the backward adjoint/optimization geometry, which provides a simple, operator-level recipe that can be applied uniformly across network components and optimizer state. By replacing the Euclidean transpose with a Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint, we derive UC gauge-consistent steepest descent and backprogation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models in reinforcement learning are crucial for scenarios where direct environment interaction is costly or impractical, but their effectiveness depends on high-quality training data.

Method: Proposes Action Shapley as an unbiased metric for training data selection and a randomized dynamic algorithm to reduce computational complexity.

Result: The algorithm achieves over 80% efficiency improvement compared to traditional methods and outperforms ad-hoc data selection in real-world case studies.

Conclusion: Action Shapley and its associated algorithm offer a significant advancement in efficient and effective training data selection for reinforcement learning world models.

Abstract: Numerous offline and model-based reinforcement learning systems incorporate world models to emulate the inherent environments. A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical. The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework for sustainable maritime transport, integrating simulation, fuel prediction, and a reward mechanism to balance safety, emissions, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vessel navigation lacks autonomy and emission awareness, relying on human experience, which can lead to errors. The paper aims to address sustainability challenges (GHG emissions, safety) in maritime transport.

Method: A CRL framework is developed with a realistic marine simulation (using real-world data and Diffusion Model), fuel consumption prediction (learning-based regression), and image-based environment representation. A lightweight CRL agent with a multi-criteria reward mechanism is designed.

Result: The framework effectively handles complex tasks, ensures stable learning in continuous action spaces, and demonstrates efficacy in sustainable and safe navigation in the Indian Ocean.

Conclusion: The integrated CRL framework successfully balances sustainability, safety, and efficiency in vessel navigation, showcasing potential for real-world maritime applications.

Abstract: Sustainability is becoming increasingly critical in the maritime transport, encompassing both environmental and social impacts, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and navigational safety. Traditional vessel navigation heavily relies on human experience, often lacking autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that may compromise safety. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with a realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment and a machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module. The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces. We validate the proposed approach in a sea area of the Indian Ocean, demonstrating its efficacy in enabling sustainable and safe vessel navigation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAConvLSTM improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and interpretability over ConvLSTM2D by factorizing gates, using multi-scale depthwise branches, and capturing teleconnections with lightweight attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ConvLSTM2D's limitations include high computational cost and inability to model long-range spatial structures and disentangled climate dynamics effectively.

Method: FAConvLSTM factorizes gate computations with bottlenecks and shared depthwise mixing, uses multi-scale dilated branches, squeeze-and-excitation recalibration, peephole connections, and lightweight axial attention.

Result: FAConvLSTM outperforms ConvLSTM2D, providing more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations with reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: FAConvLSTM is a superior drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D in modeling spatiotemporal climate data, balancing efficiency and expressiveness.

Abstract: Learning physically meaningful spatiotemporal representations from high-resolution multivariate Earth observation data is challenging due to strong local dynamics, long-range teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity. While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

### [103] [HOSL: Hybrid-Order Split Learning for Memory-Constrained Edge Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10940)
*Aakriti,Zhe Li,Dandan Liang,Chao Huang,Rui Li,Haibo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOSL introduces a hybrid-order split learning framework combining zeroth-order (ZO) optimization on clients and first-order (FO) optimization on servers to balance memory efficiency and performance in training large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing split learning (SL) systems predominantly use FO optimization, causing high memory overhead on clients, while ZO optimization reduces memory but suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance.

Method: HOSL integrates ZO optimization on clients to eliminate backpropagation and activation storage, reducing memory usage, while FO optimization on servers ensures fast convergence and performance.

Result: HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7× compared to FO methods and maintains accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of FO baselines, outperforming ZO baselines by up to 15.55%.

Conclusion: HOSL effectively balances memory efficiency and optimization performance, making it suitable for memory-efficient training on edge devices.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multivariate LSTM-based model for renewable energy generation forecasting improves accuracy, reduces CO2 emissions, and enhances power system reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variability of renewable energy sources (RESs) challenges power system operations, necessitating accurate forecasting to ensure reliability, stability, and economic efficiency. Traditional methods often fall short in capturing RES data's complexity.

Method: The paper employs a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to forecast RES generation, utilizing historical data from local and neighboring areas to capture dependencies and interactions.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates improved predictive accuracy, leading to lower CO2 emissions and more reliable electric load supply in case studies.

Conclusion: The multivariate LSTM-based approach effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods, enhancing RES generation forecasting for power systems.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into modern power systems presents significant opportunities but also notable challenges, primarily due to the inherent variability of RES generation. Accurate forecasting of RES generation is crucial for maintaining the reliability, stability, and economic efficiency of power system operations. Traditional approaches, such as deterministic methods and stochastic programming, frequently depend on representative scenarios generated through clustering techniques like K-means. However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data. The proposed model effectively captures long-term dependencies and interactions between different RESs, utilizing historical data from both local and neighboring areas to enhance predictive accuracy. In the case study, we showed that the proposed forecasting approach results in lower CO2 emissions, and a more reliable supply of electric loads.

*Ning Yang,Yikuan Zhang,Qi Ouyang,Chao Tang,Yuhai Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGD prefers flat solutions due to a nonequilibrium mechanism involving noise reshaping the loss landscape and a transient freezing mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why SGD favors flatter, more generalizable solutions in deep learning.

Method: Analyzing SGD dynamics via numerical experiments and a tractable physical model.

Result: SGD noise reshapes the landscape to favor flat solutions, and a transient freezing mechanism traps dynamics in flat minima.

Conclusion: Provides a physical framework linking SGD dynamics, landscape geometry, and generalization, suggesting optimization algorithm improvements.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is central to deep learning, yet the dynamical origin of its preference for flatter, more generalizable solutions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGF-RL, a meta-guided gradient-free RL framework for adaptive load restoration in distribution grids under uncertainty, outperforming standard RL and other methods in reliability, speed, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Restoring critical loads after extreme events is challenging due to renewable generation uncertainty and nonlinear dynamics, necessitating adaptive control solutions.

Method: MGF-RL combines first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies for scalable policy search without gradients, enabling rapid adaptation to new scenarios.

Result: Experiments on IEEE test systems show MGF-RL outperforms standard RL and other methods in reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency.

Conclusion: MGF-RL offers efficient real-time load restoration for renewable-rich grids, supported by empirical gains and theoretical regret bounds.

Abstract: Restoring critical loads after extreme events demands adaptive control to maintain distribution-grid resilience, yet uncertainty in renewable generation, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics make effective restoration difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.

TL;DR: Lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision improves fix-type classification in small automated program repair models without increasing size or complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small code models are efficient but often lack clarity in learning meaningful program structure, relying instead on shallow correlations.

Method: A reasoning distillation approach uses a large teacher model to provide structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels.

Result: Reasoning supervision enhances performance, especially on less frequent bug categories, and improves interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: Symbolic reasoning distillation is effective for improving lightweight program repair models.

Abstract: We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper clarifies the effects of constant metric scaling in Riemannian manifolds, distinguishing between changing (e.g., norms, distances) and invariant (e.g., geodesics, parallel transport) quantities, and discusses its implications for Riemannian optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clear, self-contained explanation of constant metric scaling's impact on Riemannian manifolds, addressing confusion in computational settings.

Method: A theoretical analysis distinguishing invariant geometric objects from those affected by scaling, with examples and implications for optimization.

Result: Clarifies which quantities (e.g., norms) change under scaling and which (e.g., geodesics) remain invariant, aiding computational applications.

Conclusion: Constant metric scaling can be used in Riemannian computation without altering core geometric structures, offering practical insights for optimization.

Abstract: Constant rescaling of a Riemannian metric appears in many computational settings, often through a global scale parameter that is introduced either explicitly or implicitly. Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.

Result: Findings reveal specific vulnerabilities in contrastive learning and summarize recent advancements and defenses.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the need for further research to mitigate backdoor risks and secure contrastive learning in industrial and distributed settings.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has become a leading self- supervised approach to representation learning across domains, including vision, multimodal settings, graphs, and federated learning. However, recent studies have shown that contrastive learning is susceptible to backdoor and data poisoning attacks. In these attacks, adversaries can manipulate pretraining data or model updates to insert hidden malicious behavior. This paper offers a thorough and comparative review of backdoor attacks in contrastive learning. It analyzes threat models, attack methods, target domains, and available defenses. We summarize recent advancements in this area, underline the specific vulnerabilities inherent to contrastive learning, and discuss the challenges and future research directions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-reflection framework to improve interpretability in graph learning, specifically for the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets, by iteratively refining predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of distinguishing relevant structures from spurious correlations in datasets like Spurious-Motif, which current methods struggle with.

Method: Introduces a self-reflection framework integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods, using iterative feedback and fine-tuning.

Result: Demonstrates enhanced interpretability and performance on Spurious-Motif datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Self-reflection and iterative feedback effectively improve interpretability in graph learning tasks with spurious correlations.

Abstract: Interpretable graph learning has recently emerged as a popular research topic in machine learning. The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.
  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an architecture-agnostic test-time adaptation (TDA) method using an adapter network and quantile loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods modify classifier weights heavily relying on architecture, limiting generalizability.

Method: Add an adapter network pre-processing inputs, trained with quantile loss to match high-dimensional geometric quantiles.

Result: Validated on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and TinyImageNet-C using convolutional and transformer networks.

Conclusion: Quantile loss enables optimal adapter learning, addressing distribution shift effectively.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adapting a classifier for the test data when the probability distribution of the test data slightly differs from that of the training data of the model. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing TTA approaches modify the weights of the classifier relying heavily on the architecture. It is unclear as to how these approaches are extendable to generic architectures. In this article, we propose an architecture-agnostic approach to TTA by adding an adapter network pre-processing the input images suitable to the classifier. This adapter is trained using the proposed quantile loss. Unlike existing approaches, we correct for the distribution shift by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles. We prove theoretically that under suitable conditions minimizing quantile loss can learn the optimal adapter. We validate our approach on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C and TinyImageNet-C by training both classic convolutional and transformer networks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets.

Abstract: The accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is crucial for novel drug development. However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs. To further enhance accessibility for users, we have developed a user-friendly web interface, which is available at https://wwwy1031-avp-pro.hf.space.

*Kecheng Cai,Chao Peng,Chenyang Xu,Xia Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model for QoS prediction, addressing data sparsity by iteratively refining predictions and outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QoS prediction faces challenges due to sparse user-service interactions, prompting the need for innovative solutions to improve accuracy.

Method: A self-augmented strategy is introduced, where predicted QoS values are masked and fed back into the model for refinement. This is implemented using a mixture-of-experts architecture, allowing inter-expert communication.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the method outperforms existing baselines, achieving competitive results.

Conclusion: The self-augmented mixture-of-experts model effectively addresses sparsity in QoS prediction, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is one of the most fundamental problems in service computing and personalized recommendation. In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.
  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model, addresses fraud camouflage and long-tailed data challenges in financial fraud detection by leveraging cross-view inconsistency and novelty-aware learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online financial fraud harms users and trust in digital finance, with existing GNN methods struggling with fraud camouflage and long-tailed data distributions.

Method: HIMVH uses a cross-view inconsistency perception module inspired by hippocampus conflict monitoring and a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module inspired by CA1 novelty detection.

Result: HIMVH outperforms 15 SOTA models, achieving 6.42% AUC, 9.74% F1, and 39.14% AP improvements on average across six datasets.

Conclusion: The hippocampus-inspired approach effectively detects camouflaged fraud and rare cases, enhancing financial fraud detection.

Abstract: Online financial services constitute an essential component of contemporary web ecosystems, yet their openness introduces substantial exposure to fraud that harms vulnerable users and weakens trust in digital finance. Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\% in F1 and 39.14\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.

Motivation: To improve upon traditional Bayesian context tree (BCT) models by incorporating probabilistic splits for better handling of real-valued time series.

Method: The Soft-BCT model uses soft splits and variational inference for learning, contrasting with deterministic splits in traditional BCTs.

Result: Soft-BCT matches or surpasses traditional BCT performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Soft-BCT offers a promising alternative to deterministic BCT models for real-valued time series analysis.

Abstract: This paper proposes the soft Bayesian context tree model (Soft-BCT), which is a novel BCT model for real-valued time series. The Soft-BCT considers soft (probabilistic) splits of the context space, instead of hard (deterministic) splits of the context space as in the previous BCT for real-valued time series. A learning algorithm of the Soft-BCT is proposed based on the variational inference. For some real-world datasets, the Soft-BCT demonstrates almost the same or superior performance to the previous BCT.

*Lele Zheng,Xiang Wang,Tao Zhang,Yang Cao,Ke Cheng,Yulong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SFT is a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that reduces noise impact while maintaining privacy guarantees by focusing on low-dimensional, task-specific subspaces during differential privacy fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models often uses sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP) solutions introduce noise that can degrade performance. DP-SFT aims to mitigate this by targeting noise injection more effectively.

Method: DP-SFT operates in two phases: (1) identifying a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace via principal gradient directions, and (2) projecting gradients onto this subspace, adding DP noise, and mapping back for updates, reducing overall noise impact.

Result: Experiments show DP-SFT improves accuracy, stability, and convergence under DP constraints, outperforming standard DP fine-tuning baselines.

Conclusion: DP-SFT effectively balances privacy and performance by intelligently restricting noise injection to relevant parameter spaces, enhancing model fine-tuning under DP.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on downstream tasks is crucial for realizing their cross-domain potential but often relies on sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.

TL;DR: A novel constraint-generation approach using LLMs improves clustering accuracy and efficiency by reducing LLM queries by 20x compared to traditional pairwise constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance clustering accuracy in text analysis while minimizing resource consumption, leveraging LLMs for automatic constraint generation.

Method: Proposes generating constraint sets instead of pairwise constraints, introduces a tailored clustering algorithm with confidence thresholds and penalty mechanisms.

Result: Achieves comparable clustering accuracy to state-of-the-art methods while reducing LLM queries by over 20 times.

Conclusion: The new approach effectively balances clustering performance and resource efficiency, demonstrating significant improvements in cost and accuracy.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental tool that has garnered significant interest across a wide range of applications including text analysis. To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries remains challenging, limiting advanced applications like conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing.

Method: The Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO) integrates Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions to capture global and local morphing behaviours on irregular domains. Combined with evolutionary algorithms, it optimizes voxel-level material distributions.

Result: S2NO enables super-resolution material distribution design and diverse morphing on complex geometries like irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures.

Conclusion: S2NO significantly enhances efficiency and capability in programming complex shape morphing.

Abstract: Shape-morphing soft materials can enable diverse target morphologies through voxel-level material distribution design, offering significant potential for various applications. Despite progress in basic shape-morphing design with simple geometries, achieving advanced applications such as conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing requires accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries, which remains challenging. Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design. These advancements significantly improve the efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Survival Learning with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) to address limitations in traditional credit risk models, enabling cross-institution learning without centralized data while ensuring privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tightening data-protection rules restrict cross-border sharing of borrower data, while traditional default prediction models lack timing insights and violate regulatory constraints.

Method: Proposes FSL-BDP, a framework combining federated survival learning and Bayesian differential privacy to model time-to-default without centralizing sensitive data.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show Bayesian DP outperforms classical DP in federated settings, achieving near non-private performance and reversing centralized benchmarks' rankings.

Conclusion: Privacy mechanism selection should consider deployment architecture; FSL-BDP offers practical guidance for privacy-preserving credit risk modeling in regulated environments.

Abstract: Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\% vs +1.4\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.

TL;DR: CaMol is a context-aware graph causality inference framework for few-shot molecular property prediction, leveraging causal structures and functional groups to improve accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups and identifying causal substructures in molecular property prediction.

Method: Uses a causal inference perspective with a context graph, learnable atom masking, and distribution intervener for disentangling causal effects.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, with discovered substructures aligning with chemical knowledge.

Conclusion: CaMol enhances interpretability and generalizability for unseen molecular properties through causal inference.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is becoming one of the major applications of graph learning in Web-based services, e.g., online protein structure prediction and drug discovery. A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate risks of unplanned engine failures in helicopters by evaluating effective predictive maintenance strategies.

Method: Supervised classification pipeline vs. unsupervised anomaly detection using autoencoders (AEs), tested on real-world helicopter engine telemetry data.

Result: Supervised models perform well with labeled fault data, while AEs detect faults without requiring labels, suitable for scarce failure data scenarios.

Conclusion: Unsupervised learning is viable for early fault detection in aerospace, balancing accuracy, data availability, and feasibility.

Abstract: Unplanned engine failures in helicopters can lead to severe operational disruptions, safety hazards, and costly repairs. To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two efficient algorithms, Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, for computing resistance distances on large graphs, addressing slow convergence issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for computing resistance distances struggle with slow convergence, especially for large condition numbers, limiting their applicability in graph analysis tasks.

Method: Proposed Lanczos Iteration (near-linear time global algorithm) and Lanczos Push (local algorithm with size-independent complexity), both leveraging the Lanczos method to reduce dependence on the condition number.

Result: Lanczos Iteration achieves $	ilde{O}(\sqrt\kappa m)$ complexity (speedup of $	ilde{O}(\sqrt\kappa)$), while Lanczos Push achieves $	ilde{O}(\kappa^{2.75})$ complexity (improvement of $	ilde{O}(\kappa^{0.25})$). Experiments confirm superiority in efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The Lanczos-based algorithms significantly outperform existing methods, offering practical solutions for resistance distance computation in large graphs.

Abstract: The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper discusses balancing abstraction and representation in clustering algorithms, highlighting methods like K-means, subspace clustering, and deep clustering, and suggests future adaptive approaches inspired by human cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of clustering large real datasets by balancing abstraction (removing superfluous details) and representation (emphasizing key features), ensuring effective grouping without losing critical distinctions.

Method: Explores various clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, subspace clustering, deep clustering) and their trade-offs between abstraction and representation. Discusses centroid-based and density-based losses in deep clustering to enforce abstraction.

Result: Current methods rely on explicit abstraction enforcement in objective functions. Subspace clustering aids by separating latent spaces for clustering-relevant and other data information.

Conclusion: Future clustering methods should adaptively balance abstraction and representation, inspired by human brain efficiency, to enhance performance, energy efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.
  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.
  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMM-COMET, the first method for continual source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), addressing sequential adaptation to multiple target domains with improved stability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of domain shifts in neural networks when source data is unavailable and label spaces differ, focusing on continual adaptation to multiple target domains.

Method: Combines Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework and introduces consistency losses for robustness.

Result: GMM-COMET consistently improves upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

Conclusion: GMM-COMET sets a strong baseline for continual SF-UniDA, demonstrating effectiveness in sequential domain adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation tackles the problem that domain shifts between training and test data impair the performance of neural networks in many real-world applications. Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

Conclusion: Unsupervised AE schemes can effectively detect faults in hydraulic pumps using healthy data alone.

Abstract: Unplanned failures in industrial hydraulic pumps can halt production and incur substantial costs. We explore two unsupervised autoencoder (AE) schemes for early fault detection: a feed-forward model that analyses individual sensor snapshots and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that captures short temporal windows. Both networks are trained only on healthy data drawn from a minute-level log of 52 sensor channels; evaluation uses a separate set that contains seven annotated fault intervals. Despite the absence of fault samples during training, the models achieve high reliability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses data scarcity and privacy issues in time series analysis while tackling structural complexity like multi-scale patterns and heterogeneous components.

Method: Uses a dual-path VQ-VAE to disentangle trend and seasonal components, encodes sequences into multi-resolution tokens, and performs autoregressive coarse-to-fine generation with guidance-based reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on six datasets, achieving high-quality long-term sequence generation with reduced parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses time series structural complexity and improves generation quality, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Generative modeling offers a promising solution to data scarcity and privacy challenges in time series analysis. However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods. Notably, our model achieves strong performance with a significantly reduced parameter count and exhibits superior capability in generating high-quality long-term sequences. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TimeMAR-BC5B.

Method: FAQ regenerates calibration data using a larger LLM from the same family, applies group competition for sample selection, and re-normalizes the data to enhance PTQ.

Result: FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5% compared to baselines with original calibration data.

Conclusion: FAQ effectively improves PTQ accuracy by generating representative calibration data, showcasing its potential for LLM deployment.

Abstract: Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an efficient numerical compression scheme for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices, the representativeness and universality of calibration data remain a core bottleneck in determining the accuracy of quantization parameters. Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.

*Zhikang Shen,Jianrong Lu,Haiyuan Wan,Jianhai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SDFLoRA, a federated learning method for LLMs that addresses rank heterogeneity by splitting client adapters into global and local modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods for LLMs struggle with rank heterogeneity, limiting personalization and privacy protection.

Method: Decomposes client adapters into global (shared) and local (private) modules, selectively aggregating global updates.

Result: Outperforms federated LoRA baselines on GLUE benchmarks with better utility-privacy trade-offs.

Conclusion: SDFLoRA effectively handles rank heterogeneity while enhancing privacy and personalization.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention as a way to enable privacy-preserving adaptation over distributed data. Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.

TL;DR: A new operator learning framework, MAD-BNO, uses boundary data and fundamental solutions to train neural operators without full-domain sampling, achieving high accuracy and efficiency in solving PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a data-driven approach for solving linear PDEs that avoids the computational cost of full-domain sampling and relies solely on boundary data, leveraging fundamental solutions.

Method: The method integrates the Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) technique to synthesize training data from fundamental solutions, learning boundary-to-boundary mappings and recovering interior solutions via boundary integral formulations.

Result: The MAD-BNO framework achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator methods while significantly reducing training time, validated on Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations.

Conclusion: The MAD-BNO approach is efficient, accurate, and scalable to 3D problems and complex geometries, offering a promising data-driven solution for PDEs.

Abstract: For linear partial differential equations with known fundamental solutions, this work introduces a novel operator learning framework that relies exclusively on domain boundary data, including solution values and normal derivatives, rather than full-domain sampling. By integrating the previously developed Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method, which enforces physical consistency, all training data are synthesized directly from the fundamental solutions of the target problems, resulting in a fully data-driven pipeline without the need for external measurements or numerical simulations. We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms. The proposed method is validated on benchmark operator learning tasks for two-dimensional Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations, where it achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator approaches while significantly reducing training time. The framework is naturally extensible to three-dimensional problems and complex geometries.

*Pingzhi Tang,Yiding Wang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaST is a framework for efficient knowledge adaptation in LLMs by transferring modular skills from source to target domains, outperforming SFT baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'knowledge cutoff' challenge in LLMs and improve their ability to use new information effectively.

Method: Proposes Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), leveraging orthogonal updates from SFT and RL to transfer domain-agnostic Skill Vectors.

Result: PaST achieves significant improvements on SQuAD (+9.9 points), LooGLE (+8.0 points), and ToolBench (+10.3 points).

Conclusion: PaST enables scalable and cross-domain knowledge adaptation with consistent gains across benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face the "knowledge cutoff" challenge, where their frozen parametric memory prevents direct internalization of new information. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN methods for MOR lack interpretability and fail to integrate geometric and dynamics-driven features effectively, limiting their utility in complex PDE systems.

Method: Introduces LD-GCN, which learns low-dimensional latent representations of dynamical systems using time-stepping in latent space and decodes trajectories with a GNN, avoiding encoders.

Result: LD-GCN achieves interpretable dynamics analysis and zero-shot prediction, validated by a universal approximation theorem and tested on complex mechanics problems, including Navier-Stokes bifurcations.

Conclusion: LD-GCN bridges the gap in interpretability and geometric integration for GNN-based MOR, offering promising results for complex PDE systems with practical applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first efficient agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Boosting is well-understood in classic settings but lacks efficient algorithms for agnostic cases where no data assumptions exist.

Method: Proposes an agnostic boosting algorithm that runs in polynomial time relative to sample size.

Result: Achieves near-optimal sample complexity efficiently.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in agnostic boosting by providing a practical, efficient solution.

Abstract: Boosting is a powerful method that turns weak learners, which perform only slightly better than random guessing, into strong learners with high accuracy. While boosting is well understood in the classic setting, it is less so in the agnostic case, where no assumptions are made about the data. Indeed, only recently was the sample complexity of agnostic boosting nearly settled arXiv:2503.09384, but the known algorithm achieving this bound has exponential running time. In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADHD lacks objective diagnostic tools, necessitating biologically based frameworks for precision psychiatry.

Method: Targeted metabolomic profiles from ADHD and control participants were analyzed using a CR classifier with feature selection, comparing its performance to Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor models.

Result: The CR classifier outperformed others with AUC > 0.97, identifying 14 metabolites (e.g., dopamine 4-sulfate) linked to dopaminergic and amino acid pathways.

Conclusion: This integrative approach offers a scalable, objective diagnostic tool for ADHD, combining metabolomics and interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with limited objective diagnostic tools, highlighting the urgent need for objective, biology-based diagnostic frameworks in precision psychiatry. We integrate urinary metabolomics with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify biochemical signatures associated with ADHD. Targeted metabolomic profiles from 52 ADHD and 46 control participants were analyzed using a Closest Resemblance (CR) classifier with embedded feature selection. The CR model outperformed Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, achieving an AUC > 0.97 based on a reduced panel of 14 metabolites. These metabolites including dopamine 4-sulfate, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, and citrulline map to dopaminergic neurotransmission and amino acid metabolism pathways, offering mechanistic insight into ADHD pathophysiology. The CR classifier's transparent decision boundaries and low computational cost support integration into targeted metabolomic assays and future point of care diagnostic platforms. Overall, this work demonstrates a translational framework combining metabolomics and interpretable machine learning to advance objective, biologically informed diagnostic strategies for ADHD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FORESTLLM combines decision forests' structural biases with LLMs' semantic reasoning to improve few-shot learning in tabular data, achieving top performance without relying on LLM inference at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot learning in tabular data is challenging due to unstable traditional tree methods and suboptimal LLM applications, motivating the need for a unified approach.

Method: FORESTLLM uses LLMs offline to design forests, introducing semantic splitting and deterministic leaf predictions for robustness.

Result: FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot classification and regression benchmarks.

Conclusion: FORESTLLM effectively overcomes limitations of traditional methods and LLMs for few-shot tabular learning.

Abstract: Tabular data high-stakes critical decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific discovery. Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper explores DLMs within RAG, identifies Response Semantic Drift (RSD), and proposes SPREAD to enhance precision by preserving query semantics during denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in exploring RAG's potential for DLMs due to decoding differences and to address RSD issues observed in DLM-RAG performance.

Method: Introduces SPREAD, a query-relevance-guided denoising framework for DLMs within RAG, to maintain semantic alignment and suppress drift.

Result: SPREAD significantly improves precision and mitigates RSD in generated answers compared to standard DLM-RAG setups.

Conclusion: SPREAD effectively enhances DLM-RAG performance by addressing RSD through semantic-preserving denoising strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.

TL;DR: FEATHer is an ultra-lightweight model for accurate long-term forecasting on edge devices, outperforming baselines with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series forecasting is crucial for automated industrial systems with strict latency and memory constraints, but conventional deep models are impractical.

Method: FEATHer uses multiscale frequency decomposition, a shared Dense Temporal Kernel, frequency-aware branch gating, and a Sparse Period Kernel for seasonality.

Result: FEATHer achieves top rankings in benchmarks with 60 first-place results and averages a rank of 2.05, using as few as 400 parameters.

Conclusion: FEATHer proves reliable long-range forecasting is feasible on constrained edge hardware, advancing industrial real-time inference.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental in industrial domains like manufacturing and smart factories. As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.

*Akhilesh Raj,Swann Perarnau,Aniruddha Gokhale,Solomon Bekele Abera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using offline reinforcement learning for CPU power control to enhance energy efficiency in parallel applications without significant performance loss, avoiding challenges of online RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy efficiency is crucial for modern computing systems, but online RL training for power control faces practical challenges like lack of simulation models and reliability issues.

Method: The authors use offline RL with pre-collected state transition data, combining application-agnostic performance metrics and hardware counters for gray-box energy efficiency control.

Result: Evaluated on various benchmarks with Intel's power limit mechanism, the offline-trained agent reduces energy consumption acceptably with minimal performance impact.

Conclusion: Offline RL is a viable alternative for autonomous CPU power control, balancing energy savings and performance effectively.

Abstract: Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.
  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.
  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models generate high-quality samples, and ensembling is explored to enhance them. While ensembling improves score-matching and likelihood, it doesn't consistently boost perceptual metrics like FID. Insights are provided into score model aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether ensembling, a proven method for supervised models, can improve unconditional score-based diffusion models.

Method: Investigated ensembling via Deep Ensembles and Monte Carlo Dropout on datasets like CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. Also analyzed tabular data with random forests.

Result: Ensembling improves score-matching loss and likelihood but fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics.

Conclusion: The discrepancy between technical improvements and perceptual quality highlights the complexity of ensembling in generative models. Theoretical insights into score model aggregation are provided.

Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses observational inconsistencies in inverse problems, aiming for accurate reconstructions despite partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data.

Method: The framework employs two autoencoders (parameter and observation spaces) with learned latent space mappings, enabling surrogate inversion and optimization.

Result: The approach outperforms standalone paired autoencoders and encoder-decoders, especially with data inconsistencies, validated on medical and geophysical examples.

Conclusion: The framework is versatile and effective for various inverse problems, maintaining physical model consistency while improving reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: This work describes a novel data-driven latent space inference framework built on paired autoencoders to handle observational inconsistencies when solving inverse problems. Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Diffusion Value Function (DVF) for credit assignment in MARL, addressing challenges in GMDPs by diffusing rewards over influence graphs, and proposes DA2C with LD-GNN for decentralized learning, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit assignment in MARL is challenging, especially in large-scale systems with structured interactions. Existing methods (global or local critics) are suboptimal for GMDPs.

Method: DVF is a factored value function that diffuses rewards over influence graphs with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. DA2C and LD-GNN are proposed for decentralized learning.

Result: DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes global value. DA2C outperforms baselines, improving average reward by up to 11% in benchmarks.

Conclusion: DVF and DA2C offer an effective solution for credit assignment in MARL, scalable and adaptable to decentralized settings with communication constraints.

Abstract: Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the robustness of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) under various stress tests, revealing vulnerabilities like spectral bias and sensitivity to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the failure modes of FNOs in learning PDE solution maps under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations.

Method: A systematic stress-testing framework is applied to FNOs across five PDE families, including controlled tests like parameter shifts and resolution extrapolation.

Result: Distribution shifts inflate errors significantly, resolution changes affect high-frequency modes, and input perturbations generally don't amplify errors, except in worst-case scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed failure-mode atlas and insights for enhancing the robustness of operator learning methods.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown strong performance in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but their robustness under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations remains poorly understood. We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient and low-power arrhythmia detection in heart implants or wearable devices, even for unseen patients.

Method: Utilizes LGNs and LUTNs with novel preprocessing and training methods, benchmarked on MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using inter-patient paradigm.

Result: Achieves 94.28% accuracy and 0.683 $jκ$ index, using 2.89k-6.17k FLOPs, significantly outperforming SOTA in power efficiency.

Conclusion: LGNs and LUTNs are promising for real-time, low-power ECG classification in medical devices.

Abstract: Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs) and Lookup Table Networks (LUTNs) are demonstrated to be suitable for the automatic classification of electrocardiograms (ECGs) using the inter-patient paradigm. The methods are benchmarked using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia data set, achieving up to 94.28% accuracy and a $jκ$ index of 0.683 on a four-class classification problem. Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $jκ$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set.

*Francisco Giral,Álvaro Manzano,Ignacio Gómez,Ricardo Vinuesa,Soledad Le Clainche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenDA is a generative data assimilation framework for high-resolution wind flow reconstruction from sparse sensor data, outperforming traditional methods with a 25-57% error reduction and 23-33% improved structural similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban wind flow reconstruction is crucial for air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort but is challenging with limited sensor data.

Method: GenDA uses a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on CFD simulations, combining unconditional and sensor-conditioned branches for obstacle-aware reconstruction.

Result: GenDA reduces RRMSE by 25-57% and increases SSIM by 23-33% compared to baselines, validated on RANS simulations of a real urban area.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, geometry-aware solution for wind flow reconstruction in complex domains, enhancing environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.

TL;DR: LRKV reduces KV cache memory in Transformer pretraining by exploiting redundancy across attention heads, improving efficiency without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the memory and compute constraints in Transformer pretraining, particularly the bottleneck posed by the KV cache.

Method: Proposes low-rank KV adaptation (LRKV), using shared full-rank KV projections with low-rank residuals for efficient memory use.

Result: LRKV outperforms standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA in pretraining, reducing KV cache usage by half and training compute by 20-25%.

Conclusion: LRKV is a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under constrained resources.

Abstract: Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache emerging as a dominant bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding. We propose \textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.
  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \textbf{20-25\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.

*Ziqing Zeng,Abhimanyu Kumar,Chris H. Kim,Ulya R. Karpuzcu,Sachin S. Sapatnekar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores implementing extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS Ising machine, achieving faster runtime and significant energy savings while maintaining high summary quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern extractive summarization systems rely on energy-intensive CPU/GPU infrastructures, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. This work investigates a low-power alternative using CMOS-coupled oscillator-based Ising machines (COBI).

Method: The authors propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation to address scale imbalance and improve robustness to quantization. They develop a pipeline with stochastic rounding, iterative refinement, and decomposition strategies to handle large problems efficiently on COBI.

Result: Experiments on CNN/DailyMail show COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedup, 2-3 orders of magnitude energy reduction, and competitive summary quality compared to brute-force and Tabu search methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of using CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy extractive summarization on edge devices.

Abstract: Extractive summarization (ES) aims to generate a concise summary by selecting a subset of sentences from a document while maximizing relevance and minimizing redundancy. Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.

*Hoang M. Ngo,Tre' R. Jeter,Jung Taek Seo,My T. Thai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces QUPID and R-QUPID, quantum-enhanced neural networks for anomaly detection in smart grids, offering improved accuracy and robustness over traditional ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart grids need reliable anomaly detection methods to address cyber-physical threats, system faults, and adversarial vulnerabilities.

Method: Proposes partitioned quantum neural networks (PQNNs) named QUPID and its DP-enhanced variant R-QUPID for scalable and robust anomaly detection.

Result: QUPID and R-QUPID outperform traditional ML models in anomaly detection and maintain robustness with differential privacy.

Conclusion: Quantum ML provides scalable and resilient solutions for smart grid anomaly detection, addressing limitations of conventional ML.

Abstract: Smart grid infrastructures have revolutionized energy distribution, but their day-to-day operations require robust anomaly detection methods to counter risks associated with cyber-physical threats and system faults potentially caused by natural disasters, equipment malfunctions, and cyber attacks. Conventional machine learning (ML) models are effective in several domains, yet they struggle to represent the complexities observed in smart grid systems. Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches.

*Miriam K. Wolff,Peter Calhoun,Eleonora Maria Aiello,Yao Qin,Sam F. Royston*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified T1D dataset, MetaboNet, consolidates multiple public datasets with standardized CGM and insulin data, enhancing algorithm development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented and non-standardized T1D datasets hinder algorithm development and generalizability.

Method: Consolidated 3135 subjects' data, including CGM, insulin records, and auxiliary info, into MetaboNet, with public and restricted subsets.

Result: MetaboNet offers 1228 patient-years of data, larger than benchmarks, accessible via public download or DUA-restricted processes.

Conclusion: MetaboNet provides a comprehensive, standardized resource for more generalizable T1D algorithm performance.

Abstract: Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.

TL;DR: Proposed new probe architectures improve generalization under distribution shifts, especially long-context inputs, with successful deployment in Gemini.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate misuse of powerful language models by enhancing probe generalization.

Method: Developed new probe architectures evaluated against cyber-offensive shifts.

Result: Combined architecture and diverse training ensures broad generalization; probes with prompted classifiers are cost-effective.

Conclusion: New probes successfully deployed in Gemini; AlphaEvolve shows promise for automating AI safety research.

Abstract: Frontier language model capabilities are improving rapidly. We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.
  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.
  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An AI system was developed to provide HPV vaccine information via chatbot and generate analytical reports, showing high performance in accuracy and usefulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address HPV vaccine hesitancy in Japan by bridging information gaps and countering misinformation using AI.

Method: Implemented a dual-purpose AI agent with a vector database, Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot, and automated report generation system.

Result: High scores in relevance (4.83), correctness (4.90), and multi-turn performance (overall 4.98). Reports scored well in completeness (4.00-5.00) and correctness (4.00-5.00).

Conclusion: The system effectively delivers verified HPV vaccine information and analyzes public discourse, adaptable to other medical contexts.

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy poses significant public health challenges, particularly in Japan where proactive vaccination recommendations were suspended from 2013 to 2021. The resulting information gap is exacerbated by misinformation on social media, and traditional ways cannot simultaneously address individual queries while monitoring population-level discourse. This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an integrated AI agent system for bidirectional HPV vaccine communication. The architecture enables verified information delivery with source attribution while providing systematic public discourse analysis, with a transferable framework for adaptation to other medical contexts.

TL;DR: LLMs implicitly encode trustworthiness cues during pretraining, with representations aligning closely with human trust dimensions like fairness and accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs represent perceived trustworthiness in psychologically coherent ways, given their increasing role in online systems.

Method: Analyzed instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) using the PEACE-Reviews dataset, focusing on layer- and head-level activations and probing analyses.

Result: LLMs show systematic differences in handling high- vs low-trust texts, with trust signals linearly decodable and fine-tuning refining existing representations. Strongest associations are with fairness, certainty, and accountability.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs internalize trust signals without explicit supervision, providing a foundation for designing trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Perceived trustworthiness underpins how users navigate online information, yet it remains unclear whether large language models (LLMs),increasingly embedded in search, recommendation, and conversational systems, represent this construct in psychologically coherent ways. We analyze how instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) encode perceived trustworthiness in web-like narratives using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Across models, systematic layer- and head-level activation differences distinguish high- from low-trust texts, revealing that trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining. Probing analyses show linearly de-codable trust signals and fine-tuning effects that refine rather than restructure these representations. Strongest associations emerge with appraisals of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self -- dimensions central to human trust formation online. These findings demonstrate that modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, offering a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trust-worthy AI systems in the web ecosystem.

### [152] [Building AI Agents to Improve Job Referral Requests to Strangers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10726)
*Ross Chu,Yuting Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents improve job referral requests: an improver rewrites them, and an evaluator predicts success rates. LLM revisions help weaker requests but may harm stronger ones. RAG prevents negative edits and boosts improvements, increasing success rates for weaker requests by 14%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assist job seekers in crafting more effective referral requests in professional online communities, leveraging AI to refine messaging and predict success.

Method: Uses two AI agents: an improver agent to rewrite requests and an evaluator agent to assess quality via a trained prediction model. Combines LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for better edits.

Result: LLM revisions increase predicted success rates for weaker requests by 14% without harming stronger ones. RAG prevents worsening strong requests while amplifying improvements for weaker ones.

Conclusion: AI-driven refinements, especially with RAG, enhance referral request quality. While model predictions don't guarantee real-world success, they offer low-cost signals for optimizing features before real-user experiments.

Abstract: This paper develops AI agents that help job seekers write effective requests for job referrals in a professional online community. The basic workflow consists of an improver agent that rewrites the referral request and an evaluator agent that measures the quality of revisions using a model trained to predict the probability of receiving referrals from other users. Revisions suggested by the LLM (large language model) increase predicted success rates for weaker requests while reducing them for stronger requests. Enhancing the LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevents edits that worsen stronger requests while it amplifies improvements for weaker requests. Overall, using LLM revisions with RAG increases the predicted success rate for weaker requests by 14\% without degrading performance on stronger requests. Although improvements in model-predicted success do not guarantee more referrals in the real world, they provide low-cost signals for promising features before running higher-stakes experiments on real users.

TL;DR: CTHA is a structured framework addressing coordination instability in multi-time-scale agent architectures, improving performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve inter-layer conflicts and ensure stable coordination in multi-time-scale agent systems.

Method: Introduces Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA) with three constraints: Message Contract Constraints, Authority Manifold Constraints, and Arbiter Resolution Constraints.

Result: CTHA reduces failure cascades by 47%, improves sample efficiency by 2.3x, and enhances scalability.

Conclusion: CTHA provides a robust solution for multi-agent coordination and advances autonomous systems.

Abstract: Recently, multi-time-scale agent architectures have extended the ubiquitous single-loop paradigm by introducing temporal hierarchies with distinct cognitive layers. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.

TL;DR: LMEE proposes lifelong learning for embodied agents by unifying exploration and decision-making, evaluated via LMEE-Bench, with MemoryExplorer enhancing memory recall and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embodied tasks overlook exploration and memory utilization, limiting lifelong learning capabilities.

Method: LMEE integrates exploration and decision-making, employing MemoryExplorer (a fine-tuned multimodal LLM) with a multi-task reward function.

Result: MemoryExplorer outperforms state-of-the-art models in long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: LMEE fosters lifelong learning in embodied agents by addressing exploration and memory, validated by LMEE-Bench.

Abstract: An ideal embodied agent should possess lifelong learning capabilities to handle long-horizon and complex tasks, enabling continuous operation in general environments. This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art embodied exploration models demonstrate that our approach achieves significant advantages in long-horizon embodied tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the modeling of complex product-innovation processes by avoiding numerical reliance and using trend-based heuristics for better clarity.

Method: Uses trend models (increasing, decreasing, or constant) as minimally information-intensive quantifiers and represents solutions as transition graphs of scenarios.

Result: Enables depiction of any possible future or past behavior of the system through paths in the transition graph.

Conclusion: Trend models provide a flexible and simplified way to analyze product-innovation processes by focusing on scenario transitions.

Abstract: This paper investigates complex product-innovation processes using models grounded in a set of heuristics. Each heuristic is expressed through simple trends -- increasing, decreasing, or constant -- which serve as minimally information-intensive quantifiers, avoiding reliance on numerical values or rough sets. A solution to a trend model is defined as a set of scenarios with possible transitions between them, represented by a transition graph. Any possible future or past behaviour of the system under study can thus be depicted by a path within this graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and advance few-shot generalization and abstract reasoning in AI, particularly through the ARC-AGI benchmark series, and to address emerging challenges like knowledge-dependent overfitting.

Method: Surveyed top-performing methods in ARC-AGI-2, analyzed refinement loops (e.g., evolutionary program synthesis, application-layer refinements), and evaluated zero-pretraining deep learning approaches.

Result: Top score reached 24% on ARC-AGI-2, with refinement loops and small networks (7M parameters) showing competitive performance. Frontier AI labs acknowledged ARC-AGI as a standard, but performance is limited by knowledge coverage.

Conclusion: Refinement loops and small-scale methods show promise, but AGI progress remains constrained by knowledge dependence. ARC-AGI-3 aims to address this with interactive reasoning challenges requiring exploration, planning, and alignment.

Abstract: The ARC-AGI benchmark series serves as a critical measure of few-shot generalization on novel tasks, a core aspect of intelligence. The ARC Prize 2025 global competition targeted the newly released ARC-AGI-2 dataset, which features greater task complexity compared to its predecessor. The Kaggle competition attracted 1,455 teams and 15,154 entries, with the top score reaching 24% on the ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation set. Paper submissions nearly doubled year-over-year to 90 entries, reflecting the growing research interest in fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning. The defining theme of 2025 is the emergence of the refinement loop -- a per-task iterative program optimization loop guided by a feedback signal. Refinement loops come in a variety of forms, in particular evolutionary program synthesis approaches and application-layer refinements to commercial AI systems. Such refinement loops are also possible in weight space, as evidenced by zero-pretraining deep learning methods which are now achieving competitive performance with remarkably small networks (7M parameters). In parallel, four frontier AI labs (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and xAI) reported ARC-AGI performance in public model cards in 2025, establishing ARC-AGI as an industry standard benchmark for AI reasoning. However, our analysis indicates that current frontier AI reasoning performance remains fundamentally constrained to knowledge coverage, giving rise to new forms of benchmark contamination. In this paper, we survey the top-performing methods, examine the role of refinement loops in AGI progress, discuss knowledge-dependent overfitting, and preview ARC-AGI-3, which introduces interactive reasoning challenges that require exploration, planning, memory, goal acquisition, and alignment capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to isolate dataset selection's role in multimodal reasoning by fixing models and training protocols, using the DCVLR challenge as a testbed.

Method: The authors used a compact curated dataset from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, focusing on difficulty-based example selection and post-competition ablations.

Result: Their submission won first place, showing difficulty-based selection drives performance gains, while dataset size only reduces variance, and diversity/synthetic heuristics often degrade results.

Conclusion: DCVLR is a saturation-regime evaluation, emphasizing alignment and difficulty as key for data-efficient multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: We study data curation for multimodal reasoning through the NeurIPS 2025 Data Curation for Vision-Language Reasoning (DCVLR) challenge, which isolates dataset selection by fixing the model and training protocol. Using a compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance. These results characterize DCVLR as a saturation-regime evaluation and highlight the central role of alignment and difficulty in data-efficient multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: HADES is a Bayesian optimization method using Hamiltonian dynamics and structure-aware posterior approximation for efficient protein sequence design, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing protein optimization methods struggle with high-dimensional complexities and neglect structural constraints, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: HADES employs Hamiltonian dynamics for sampling, a discretization procedure for sequence proposals, and a two-stage encoder-decoder framework for learning structure-function relationships.

Result: HADES outperforms state-of-the-art methods in evaluations and leverages structure-sequence constraints for optimized designs.

Conclusion: HADES offers a transformative approach for protein engineering by integrating structural awareness and efficient optimization.

Abstract: The ability to engineer optimized protein variants has transformative potential for biotechnology and medicine. Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics. Remarkably, our approach offers a unique advantage by leveraging the mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence, facilitating the design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/GENTEL-lab/HADES.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL-based agentic search improves LLMs' accuracy but lacks reliability in admitting uncertain answers. BAPO framework introduces boundary-aware rewards to enhance reliability without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based agents often provide unreliable answers due to inability to recognize reasoning limits, posing risks in real-world applications.

Method: Proposes Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO) with boundary-aware rewards and adaptive reward modulation.

Result: BAPO significantly boosts reliability across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: BAPO successfully addresses the reliability gap in agentic search while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: RL-based agentic search enables LLMs to solve complex questions via dynamic planning and external search. While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit ``I DON'T KNOW'' (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgencyBench is introduced as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents across 6 core capabilities in 32 real-world scenarios, addressing scalability and automation gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the ability to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios and rely on human feedback, creating scalability issues. AgencyBench aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The benchmark includes 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics, requiring extensive tool calls and tokens to complete. Automated evaluation uses a user simulation agent and Docker sandbox.

Result: Closed-source models outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%), showing disparities in resource efficiency, self-correction, and tool-use preferences. Proprietary models perform better within native ecosystems.

Conclusion: AgencyBench highlights the need for co-optimizing model architectures with agentic frameworks, providing a testbed for future agent development and releasing tools for broader use.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based autonomous agents demonstrate multifaceted capabilities to contribute substantially to economic production. However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.

### [161] [MiCA: A Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter for Lightweight Epidemic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11089)
*Suhan Guo,Jiahong Deng,Furao Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MiCA, a lightweight module for epidemic forecasting, uses causal discovery to infer mobility relations and integrates them into models via gated residual mixing, improving accuracy under noisy data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting infectious disease dynamics is crucial for public health, but existing methods struggle with noisy mobility data and short, coarse-grained case time series.

Method: MiCA employs causal discovery to infer mobility relations and integrates them into forecasting models using gated residual mixing, avoiding heavy computational components.

Result: MiCA improves lightweight forecasters by an average of 7.5% across four epidemic datasets, matching SOTA models while remaining lightweight.

Conclusion: MiCA offers a robust and efficient solution for integrating mobility data into epidemic forecasting, enhancing accuracy without heavy computational demands.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of infectious disease dynamics is critical for public health planning and intervention. Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.

### [162] [ReCreate: Reasoning and Creating Domain Agents Driven by Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11100)
*Zhezheng Hao,Hong Wang,Jian Luo,Jianqing Zhang,Yuyan Zhou,Qiang Lin,Can Wang,Hande Dong,Jiawei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCreate is an experience-driven framework automating domain agent creation by leveraging interaction histories, outperforming human-designed and existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated agent creation overlooks critical success/failure evidence and requires high computational costs, prompting a more systematic approach.

Method: ReCreate uses agent-as-optimizer with experience storage/retrieval, reasoning-creating synergy, and hierarchical updates to refine agents.

Result: ReCreate outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated methods across diverse domains.

Conclusion: ReCreate demonstrates the effectiveness of experience-driven automation for scalable agent creation.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents are reshaping the industrial landscape. However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.

*Zixu Wang,Bingbing Xu,Yige Yuan,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCALE proposes a low-cost task-level workflow generation framework, reducing token usage by 83% with minimal performance loss compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing workflow generation methods in Multi-Agent Systems are costly and unreliable, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: SCALE uses self-prediction and few-shot calibration for evaluation, avoiding exhaustive execution-based validation.

Result: SCALE reduces token usage by up to 83% with only a 0.61% average performance degradation.

Conclusion: SCALE offers a cost-effective and reliable alternative to traditional workflow generation methods in MAS.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on large language models typically solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents through workflows. Existing approaches generates workflows either at task level or query level, but their relative costs and benefits remain unclear. After rethinking and empirical analyses, we show that query-level workflow generation is not always necessary, since a small set of top-K best task-level workflows together already covers equivalent or even more queries. We further find that exhaustive execution-based task-level evaluation is both extremely token-costly and frequently unreliable. Inspired by the idea of self-evolution and generative reward modeling, we propose a low-cost task-level generation framework \textbf{SCALE}, which means \underline{\textbf{S}}elf prediction of the optimizer with few shot \underline{\textbf{CAL}}ibration for \underline{\textbf{E}}valuation instead of full validation execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{SCALE} maintains competitive performance, with an average degradation of just 0.61\% compared to existing approach across multiple datasets, while cutting overall token usage by up to 83\%.

*Girish A. Koushik,Helen Treharne,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TANDEM is a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection into structured reasoning, outperforming baselines and improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated systems for hate speech detection lack interpretability and granular evidence needed for effective human-in-the-loop moderation.

Method: TANDEM uses tandem reinforcement learning with vision-language and audio-language models to optimize cross-modal context without dense supervision.

Result: TANDEM achieves 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (30% improvement) and maintains precise temporal grounding.

Conclusion: Structured, interpretable alignment is achievable in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for transparent moderation tools.

Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly dominated by long-form multimodal content, where harmful narratives are constructed through a complex interplay of audio, visual, and textual cues. While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as "black boxes" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.

TL;DR: Think-with-Me introduces interactive feedback into the reasoning process of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) using transitional conjunctions, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies like overthinking and overshoot in LRMs by enabling external intervention during reasoning.

Method: Pauses reasoning at transitional conjunctions for feedback (human or LLM-generated), using multi-criteria evaluation and GRPO training.

Result: Achieves better accuracy-reasoning length balance, outperforming QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy with 81% shorter reasoning.

Conclusion: The paradigm enhances reasoning efficiency, accuracy, and applicability to security and creative tasks.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at multi-step reasoning but often suffer from inefficient reasoning processes like overthinking and overshoot, where excessive or misdirected reasoning increases computational cost and degrades performance. Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate AI-human alignment beyond traditional metrics like accuracy, focusing on decision mechanisms and subgroup disparities.

Method: Fits a mechanism-based model to human and LLM decisions, comparing parameter vectors for alignment assessment, validated via robustness checks.

Result: Identifies heterogeneous alignment across models and activities, with notable misalignments in Black and married groups, mitigated by RAG.

Conclusion: XChoice offers metrics for diagnosing misalignment and guiding improvements, emphasizing mechanism-based insights over surface outcomes.

Abstract: We present XChoice, an explainable framework for evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making. Moving beyond outcome agreement such as accuracy and F1 score, XChoice fits a mechanism-based decision model to human data and LLM-generated decisions, recovering interpretable parameters that capture the relative importance of decision factors, constraint sensitivity, and implied trade-offs. Alignment is assessed by comparing these parameter vectors across models, options, and subgroups. We demonstrate XChoice on Americans' daily time allocation using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) as human ground truth, revealing heterogeneous alignment across models and activities and salient misalignment concentrated in Black and married groups. We further validate robustness of XChoice via an invariance analysis and evaluate targeted mitigation with a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) intervention. Overall, XChoice provides mechanism-based metrics that diagnose misalignment and support informed improvements beyond surface outcome matching.

TL;DR: A benchmark called AstroReason-Bench is introduced to evaluate agentic LLMs in physics-constrained Space Planning Problems (SPP), revealing limitations compared to specialized solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored performance of agentic LLMs in real-world, physics-constrained domains like space planning, where tasks involve high stakes, diverse objectives, and strict constraints.

Method: Developed AstroReason-Bench, integrating multiple scheduling regimes (e.g., ground station communication, agile Earth observation) with a unified agent-oriented interaction protocol, and evaluated state-of-the-art agentic LLMs.

Result: Current agentic LLMs significantly underperform specialized solvers in SPPs, exposing limitations in generalist planning under realistic constraints.

Conclusion: AstroReason-Bench serves as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing agentic LLM research in complex, constrained domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as generalist planners capable of reasoning and acting across diverse tasks. However, existing agent benchmarks largely focus on symbolic or weakly grounded environments, leaving their performance in physics-constrained real-world domains underexplored. We introduce AstroReason-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic planning in Space Planning Problems (SPP), a family of high-stakes problems with heterogeneous objectives, strict physical constraints, and long-horizon decision-making. AstroReason-Bench integrates multiple scheduling regimes, including ground station communication and agile Earth observation, and provides a unified agent-oriented interaction protocol. Evaluating on a range of state-of-the-art open- and closed-source agentic LLM systems, we find that current agents substantially underperform specialized solvers, highlighting key limitations of generalist planning under realistic constraints. AstroReason-Bench offers a challenging and diagnostic testbed for future agentic research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-phase probe and solve algorithm for automated hyperparameter optimization in constraint programming solvers, showing significant performance improvements with Bayesian optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually tuning solver hyperparameters is difficult and time-consuming, requiring expert knowledge. Automated methods are needed to improve efficiency and performance.

Method: The probe and solve algorithm divides the time budget into probing (hyperparameter exploration) and solving (execution with best configuration). It compares Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search.

Result: Bayesian optimization outperformed default configurations, improving ACE's performance in 25.4% of instances and Choco's in 38.6%. It also surpassed Hamming distance search.

Conclusion: The probe and solve algorithm provides a practical, effective method for hyperparameter tuning, enhancing solver performance across diverse problems.

Abstract: The performance of constraint programming solvers is highly sensitive to the choice of their hyperparameters. Manually finding the best solver configuration is a difficult, time-consuming task that typically requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.
  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.
  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search. Overall, the probe and solve algorithm offers a practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types.

TL;DR: The paper extends a prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning across multiple Key Performance Indicators, outperforming benchmarks in data-scarce settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the framework's applicability by testing its performance across various Key Performance Indicators and understanding its reasoning mechanisms.

Method: Extends the LLM-based framework to evaluate Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction using three event logs and compares it with benchmark methods.

Result: In data-scarce scenarios (100 traces), the LLM outperforms benchmarks, leveraging prior knowledge and internal trace correlations while employing higher-order reasoning.

Conclusion: The LLM-based framework demonstrates superior performance and advanced reasoning capabilities in predictive process monitoring, especially with limited data.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring is a branch of process mining that aims to predict the outcome of an ongoing process. Recently, it leveraged machine-and-deep learning architectures. In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework called LEG that combines optimization techniques with LLMs to prioritize health facility upgrades in Ethiopia, balancing expert qualitative input with population coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethiopia's Ministry of Health seeks to upgrade rural health posts but faces resource constraints. Traditional optimization methods lack flexibility for qualitative expert input, necessitating a hybrid approach.

Method: The LEG framework integrates a provable greedy algorithm for coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement, aligning AI outputs with expert qualitative guidance.

Result: Tests on data from three Ethiopian regions show the framework effectively balances coverage optimization with stakeholder preferences.

Conclusion: The LEG framework offers a practical solution for equitable, data-driven health system planning by combining optimization and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is upgrading health posts to improve access to essential services, particularly in rural areas. Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven analytics lack structured tactical representations for combat sports like boxing, which limit strategic insights despite the sport's complexity.

Method: BoxMind parses boxing footage into 18 hierarchical tactical indicators, uses a graph-based predictive model combining explicit profiles and latent embeddings, and generates actionable tactical adjustments.

Result: The system achieves 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph and 87.5% on Olympic matches, contributing to three gold and two silver medals for the Chinese National Team in 2024.

Conclusion: BoxMind successfully bridges computer vision and decision support in sports, offering a replicable framework for transforming unstructured video data into strategic intelligence.

Abstract: Competitive sports require sophisticated tactical analysis, yet combat disciplines like boxing remain underdeveloped in AI-driven analytics due to the complexity of action dynamics and the lack of structured tactical representations. To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches. Using this predictive model as a foundation, the system generates strategic recommendations that demonstrate proficiency comparable to human experts. BoxMind is validated through a closed-loop deployment during the 2024 Paris Olympics, directly contributing to the Chinese National Team's historic achievement of three gold and two silver medals. BoxMind establishes a replicable paradigm for transforming unstructured video data into strategic intelligence, bridging the gap between computer vision and decision support in competitive sports.
