### [1] [A Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer for Emotion Recognition and Adaptive Human-Computer Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14259)
*Ziwen Zhong,Zhitao Shu,Yue Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework is proposed for robust multimodal emotion recognition, integrating visual, auditory, and textual signals with cloud computing, outperforming baselines in performance and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-modality emotion recognition systems lack robustness and generalization. Multimodal approaches and cloud scalability are needed for real-world HCI applications.

Method: The CMT framework combines pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, BERT) with cross-modal attention and cloud deployment (Kubernetes, TensorFlow Serving) for scalable, low-latency recognition.

Result: CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance (3.0% higher F1-score, 12.9% lower cross-entropy loss) and reduces latency to 128 ms (35% improvement).

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition for applications like customer service and tutoring, advancing cloud-native affective computing.

Abstract: Emotion recognition is a fundamental component of next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling machines to perceive, understand, and respond to users' affective states. However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.

*Taoliang Tan,Chengwei Ma,Zhen Tian,Zhao Lin,Dongdong Li,Si Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel three-stage framework using MLLMs improves intelligent review of power grid drawings by enhancing semantic understanding and error identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated systems fail to handle ultra-high-resolution power grid drawings effectively due to computational limits and lack of holistic semantic understanding.

Method: A three-stage framework: global semantic understanding with MLLMs, high-resolution fine-grained recognition, and comprehensive decision-making for error diagnosis.

Result: Preliminary tests show improved accuracy in defect discovery and reliability in review judgments compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The framework presents a prompt-driven, reliable approach for intelligent power grid drawing review.

Abstract: The intelligent review of power grid engineering design drawings is crucial for power system safety. However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference. This research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review.

### [3] [LURE: Latent Space Unblocking for Multi-Concept Reawakening in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14330)
*Mengyu Sun,Ziyuan Yang,Andrew Beng Jin Teoh,Junxu Liu,Haibo Hu,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LURE, a method to reawaken erased concepts in diffusion models by analyzing and perturbing multiple generative factors, addressing limitations of existing prompt-level approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept reawakening methods focus on prompt-level optimization, missing insights from other generative factors, which limits understanding and effectiveness.

Method: The paper models generation as an implicit function to analyze factors like text conditions and latent states, proposing LURE with semantic re-binding and Gradient Field Orthogonalization for multi-concept scenarios.

Result: LURE successfully reawakens multiple erased concepts simultaneously across various tasks, surpassing prior methods in fidelity and stability.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that comprehensive analysis of generative factors leads to more effective concept reawakening, with LURE offering a robust solution.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to suppress sensitive content in diffusion models, but recent studies show that erased concepts can still be reawakened, revealing vulnerabilities in erasure methods. Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.

### [4] [CityCube: Benchmarking Cross-view Spatial Reasoning on Vision-Language Models in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14339)
*Haotian Xu,Yue Hu,Zhengqiu Zhu,Chen Gao,Ziyou Wang,Junreng Rao,Wenhao Lu,Weishi Li,Quanjun Yin,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CityCube is a benchmark assessing VLMs' cross-view reasoning in urban spaces, revealing a performance gap between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for cross-view spatial reasoning in open-ended urban environments.

Method: Creation of CityCube with 5,022 annotated multi-view QA pairs across five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions.

Result: VLMs show significant performance disparity with humans; fine-tuned models perform better but still lag.

Conclusion: CityCube highlights the need for improved benchmarks to bridge the cognitive gap between VLMs and humans.

Abstract: Cross-view spatial reasoning is essential for embodied AI, underpinning spatial understanding, mental simulation and planning in complex environments. Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark. Further analyses indicate the task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparity between VLMs and human-like reasoning.

Motivation: Large-scale medical datasets often contain uneven-quality labels, which can negatively impact model training and robustness.

Method: SegAE, trained on over four million image-label pairs, predicts label quality for 142 anatomical structures using a vision-language model approach.

Result: SegAE achieves a 0.902 correlation with ground-truth Dice scores, processes 3D masks in 0.06s, and reduces annotation costs by one-third while cutting quality-checking time by 70%.

Conclusion: SegAE offers a simple and effective solution for quality control in medical segmentation, with practical benefits for active and semi-supervised learning.

Abstract: Large-scale medical segmentation datasets often combine manual and pseudo-labels of uneven quality, which can compromise training and evaluation. Low-quality labels may hamper performance and make the model training less robust. To address this issue, we propose SegAE (Segmentation Assessment Engine), a lightweight vision-language model (VLM) that automatically predicts label quality across 142 anatomical structures. Trained on over four million image-label pairs with quality scores, SegAE achieves a high correlation coefficient of 0.902 with ground-truth Dice similarity and evaluates a 3D mask in 0.06s. SegAE shows several practical benefits: (I) Our analysis reveals widespread low-quality labeling across public datasets; (II) SegAE improves data efficiency and training performance in active and semi-supervised learning, reducing dataset annotation cost by one-third and quality-checking time by 70% per label. This tool provides a simple and effective solution for quality control in large-scale medical segmentation datasets.

Method: Utilizes a hybrid attention mechanism for spatial and semantic feature extraction, integrates features for detailed scene descriptions, and develops a new dataset from BDD100K.

Result: The model performs well on the new dataset, as shown by CIDEr, SPICE metrics, and human assessments.

*A. Enes Doruk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR multimodal 3D occupancy prediction model to address computational and dynamic challenges in autonomous vehicle perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sparse object detection paradigm is insufficient for long-tail safety challenges in autonomous driving, and current voxelization methods are computationally complex and brittle in dynamic environments.

Method: The model combines LiDAR and camera data using four components: LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation, Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, and a Gauss-Mamba Head for efficient global context decoding.

Result: The proposed solution bridges camera semantics and LiDAR geometry efficiently, addressing sparsity, noise, and dynamic recalibration with linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: This work enhances 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous vehicles by improving computational efficiency and robustness in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The sparse object detection paradigm shift towards dense 3D semantic occupancy prediction is necessary for dealing with long-tail safety challenges for autonomous vehicles. Nonetheless, the current voxelization methods commonly suffer from excessive computation complexity demands, where the fusion process is brittle, static, and breaks down under dynamic environmental settings. To this end, this research work enhances a novel Gaussian-based adaptive camera-LiDAR multimodal 3D occupancy prediction model that seamlessly bridges the semantic strengths of camera modality with the geometric strengths of LiDAR modality through a memory-efficient 3D Gaussian model. The proposed solution has four key components: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), where depth-wise deformable sampling is employed for dealing with geometric sparsity, (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, where cross-entropy is employed for handling domain-specific noise, (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, where dynamic recalibration of sensor outputs is performed based on model outputs, and (4) Gauss-Mamba Head that uses Selective State Space Models for global context decoding that enjoys linear computation complexity.

### [8] [Real-Time Wildfire Localization on the NASA Autonomous Modular Sensor using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14475)
*Yajvan Ravan,Aref Malek,Chester Dolph,Nikhil Behari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-annotated, multi-spectral dataset for wildfire detection from aerial imagery, demonstrating a deep-learning model that outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-altitude aerial imagery for wildfire detection is scarce and costly, yet essential for advancing algorithms and applying machine learning to high-impact problems like wildfire detection.

Method: A dataset combining 12 spectral channels (including IR, SWIR, and thermal) is created from 20 wildfire missions. Two deep neural networks (for classification and segmentation) are trained and combined into a real-time model for fire localization.

Result: The model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% IoU, and 84% recall, outperforming past methods. It excels in detecting wildfires at night, behind clouds, and distinguishing false positives.

Conclusion: The multi-spectral dataset and deep-learning model significantly improve wildfire detection, with SWIR, IR, and thermal bands proving most critical for accurate fire perimeter determination. The dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: High-altitude, multi-spectral, aerial imagery is scarce and expensive to acquire, yet it is necessary for algorithmic advances and application of machine learning models to high-impact problems such as wildfire detection. We introduce a human-annotated dataset from the NASA Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS) using 12-channel, medium to high altitude (3 - 50 km) aerial wildfire images similar to those used in current US wildfire missions. Our dataset combines spectral data from 12 different channels, including infrared (IR), short-wave IR (SWIR), and thermal. We take imagery from 20 wildfire missions and randomly sample small patches to generate over 4000 images with high variability, including occlusions by smoke/clouds, easily-confused false positives, and nighttime imagery.
  We demonstrate results from a deep-learning model to automate the human-intensive process of fire perimeter determination. We train two deep neural networks, one for image classification and the other for pixel-level segmentation. The networks are combined into a unique real-time segmentation model to efficiently localize active wildfire on an incoming image feed. Our model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union(IoU), and 84% recall surpassing past methods, including models trained on satellite data and classical color-rule algorithms. By leveraging a multi-spectral dataset, our model is able to detect active wildfire at nighttime and behind clouds, while distinguishing between false positives. We find that data from the SWIR, IR, and thermal bands is the most important to distinguish fire perimeters. Our code and dataset can be found here: https://github.com/nasa/Autonomous-Modular-Sensor-Wildfire-Segmentation/tree/main and https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-u4vs9rqwkwgdeeeoUhftCxrfe_4QPTn?=usp=drive_link

*Frank Bieder,Hendrik Königshof,Haohao Hu,Fabian Immel,Yinzhe Shen,Jan-Hendrik Pauls,Christoph Stiller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summarizes a novel method for transferring sensor-specific knowledge from camera images to LiDAR using pseudo labels, outperforming baseline approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, especially matching sensor characteristics and modalities.

Method: Proposes XD-MAP, leveraging camera detections to create a semantic parametric map for pseudo labels in LiDAR, without manual annotation.

Result: Outperforms baselines by +19.5 mIoU (2D semantic), +19.5 PQth (2D panoptic), and +32.3 mIoU (3D semantic), demonstrating strong LiDAR performance without labels.

Conclusion: XD-MAP effectively transfers knowledge from camera to LiDAR, achieving high performance without manual labeling.

Abstract: Until open-world foundation models match the performance of specialized approaches, the effectiveness of deep learning models remains heavily dependent on dataset availability. Training data must align not only with the target object categories but also with the sensor characteristics and modalities. To bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, domain adaptation strategies are widely used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to transferring sensor-specific knowledge from an image dataset to LiDAR, an entirely different sensing domain. Our method XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target domain without any manual annotation effort. Unlike previous domain transfer approaches, our method does not require direct overlap between sensors and enables extending the angular perception range from a front-view camera to a full 360 view. On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving strong performance on LiDAR data without any manual labeling.

### [10] [GutenOCR: A Grounded Vision-Language Front-End for Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14490)
*Hunter Heidenreich,Ben Elliott,Olivia Dinica,Yosheb Getachew*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GutenOCR is a grounded OCR model family fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL, offering unified reading, detection, and grounding via prompts. It excels in business and scientific documents but has trade-offs in certain layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance OCR capabilities by integrating reading, detection, and grounding into a single vision-language model with a unified interface.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL models (3B and 7B) on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, enabling full-page and localized OCR with bounding boxes and conditional queries.

Result: GutenOCR-7B doubled the grounded OCR score of its backbone (0.40 to 0.82) and improved region/line-level OCR and detection recall, but showed trade-offs in page linearization and color-guided OCR.

Conclusion: GutenOCR advances grounded OCR performance significantly but faces challenges in specific document layouts, highlighting areas for future improvement.

Abstract: GutenOCR is a family of grounded OCR front-ends obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. The resulting single-checkpoint vision-language models expose reading, detection, and grounding through a unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.

### [11] [PAS-Mamba: Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model for MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14530)
*Xiaoyan Kui,Zijie Fan,Zexin Ji,Qinsong Li,Hao Xu,Weixin Si,Haodong Xu,Beiji Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PAS-Mamba, a framework for MRI reconstruction that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and integrates it with spatial features, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRI reconstruction methods treat the frequency domain as a whole, ignoring differences between phase and magnitude components, which carry distinct image information.

Method: PAS-Mamba disentangles phase and magnitude into separate branches, uses LocalMamba for spatial details, CFDS for frequency serialization, and DDCFM for fusion.

Result: PAS-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods on IXI and fastMRI knee datasets.

Conclusion: Decoupling phase and magnitude modeling while combining frequency and spatial features improves MRI reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Joint feature modeling in both the spatial and frequency domains has become a mainstream approach in MRI reconstruction. However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDT-Net introduces a dual-teacher, single-student framework with Dynamic Teacher Switching and hierarchical feature alignment to improve scribble-supervised medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce annotation burden in medical image segmentation while addressing ambiguity from sparse scribble annotations.

Method: Uses Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) and Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) modules for pseudo-label refinement and multi-level feature alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets.

Conclusion: SDT-Net effectively leverages weak annotations for accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.

Abstract: Scribble-supervised methods have emerged to mitigate the prohibitive annotation burden in medical image segmentation. However, the inherent sparsity of these annotations introduces significant ambiguity, which results in noisy pseudo-label propagation and hinders the learning of robust anatomical boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose SDT-Net, a novel dual-teacher, single-student framework designed to maximize supervision quality from these weak signals. Our method features a Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select the most reliable teacher. This selected teacher then guides the student via two synergistic mechanisms: high-confidence pseudo-labels, refined by a Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism, and multi-level feature alignment, enforced by a Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module. Extensive experiments on the ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets demonstrate that SDT-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more accurate and anatomically plausible segmentation.

*Wei Ma,Shaowu Chen,Junjie Ye,Peichang Zhang,Lei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fuzzy controller (FC-r) to dynamically switch between models of varying scales during video inference, balancing resource efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video inference enhancement methods focus on scaling models but overlook resource efficiency, leading to inefficiency.

Method: A fuzzy controller (FC-r) guides a framework using spatiotemporal correlations to switch models dynamically based on real-time resource conditions.

Result: Experiments show the method balances resource utilization and inference performance effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the trade-off between resource efficiency and inference effectiveness.

Abstract: Existing video inference (VI) enhancement methods typically aim to improve performance by scaling up model sizes and employing sophisticated network architectures. While these approaches demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, they often overlooked the trade-off of resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal inference performance. To address this problem, a fuzzy controller (FC-r) is developed based on key system parameters and inference-related metrics. Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged. Given the real-time resource conditions of the target device, the framework can dynamically switch between models of varying scales during VI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves a balance between resource utilization and inference performance.

### [14] [Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion for Brain MRI Progression Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14584)
*Cheng Wan,Bahram Jafrasteh,Ehsan Adeli,Miaomiao Zhang,Qingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG-LDM simplifies brain MRI progression modeling by integrating anatomical consistency directly into a latent diffusion model, outperforming complex methods in accuracy and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like BrLP are complex and lack anatomical consistency. AG-LDM aims to simplify training while ensuring accurate, clinically relevant brain MRI progression modeling.

Method: AG-LDM uses segmentation-guided latent diffusion, fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-ups, and clinical covariates directly. It avoids auxiliary networks by training end-to-end.

Result: AG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art image quality, reduces volumetric errors by 15-20%, and better utilizes clinical data (31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP).

Conclusion: AG-LDM is an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling, capturing disease hallmarks accurately.

Abstract: Accurately modeling longitudinal brain MRI progression is crucial for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and predicting individualized structural changes. Existing state-of-the-art approaches, such as Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), often use multi-stage training pipelines with auxiliary conditioning modules but suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of conditional clinical covariates, and limited guarantees of anatomical consistency. We propose Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM), a segmentation-guided framework that enforces anatomically consistent progression while substantially simplifying the training pipeline. AG-LDM conditions latent diffusion by directly fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input level, a strategy that avoids auxiliary control networks by learning a unified, end-to-end model that represents both anatomy and progression. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion model training, ensuring consistent brain tissue boundaries and morphometric fidelity. Experiments on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and zero-shot evaluation on OASIS-3 demonstrate that AG-LDM matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20\% reduction in volumetric errors in generated images. AG-LDM also exhibits markedly stronger utilization of temporal and clinical covariates (up to 31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP) and generates biologically plausible counterfactual trajectories, accurately capturing hallmarks of Alzheimer's progression such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion. These results highlight AG-LDM as an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2D-VoCo is an efficient adaptation of VoCo for slice-level self-supervised pre-training on 2D CT slices, reducing dependency on labeled data and improving model performance in clinical CT analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the labeling scarcity issue and high computational costs associated with 3D self-supervised methods like VoCo for medical image analysis.

Method: Proposes 2D-VoCo, a contrastive learning framework for pre-training CNN backbones on unlabeled 2D CT slices, later integrated into a CNN-LSTM architecture for multi-organ injury classification.

Result: Significantly improves mAP, precision, recall, and RSNA score on the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma dataset compared to training from scratch.

Conclusion: 2D-VoCo offers a practical solution to reduce labeled data dependency and enhance performance in clinical CT analysis, with released code for reproducibility.

Abstract: The requirement for expert annotations limits the effectiveness of deep learning for medical image analysis. Although 3D self-supervised methods like volume contrast learning (VoCo) are powerful and partially address the labeling scarcity issue, their high computational cost and memory consumption are barriers. We propose 2D-VoCo, an efficient adaptation of the VoCo framework for slice-level self-supervised pre-training that learns spatial-semantic features from unlabeled 2D CT slices via contrastive learning. The pre-trained CNN backbone is then integrated into a CNN-LSTM architecture to classify multi-organ injuries. In the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma dataset, 2D-VoCo pre-training significantly improves mAP, precision, recall, and RSNA score over training from scratch. Our framework provides a practical method to reduce the dependency on labeled data and enhance model performance in clinical CT analysis.

### [16] [LFS: Learnable Frame Selector for Event-Aware and Temporally Diverse Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14594)
*Lianying Chao,Linfeng Yin,Peiyu Ren,Yifan Jiang,Qiaoyu Ren,Dingcheng Shan,Jing-cheng Pang,Sijie Wu,Xubin Li,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) to improve video captioning by selecting diverse and relevant frames, leveraging LLMs' feedback, and introduces ICH-CC benchmark for human-consistent evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sampling for video captioning ignores uneven event distribution, motivating LFS for better frame selection.

Method: LFS models temporal importance, uses stratified selection, and learns from LLM caption feedback. ICH-CC benchmark is introduced for human-consistent evaluation.

Result: LFS improves captioning by 2.0% on VDC and 4% on ICH-CC, enhancing downstream tasks like video QA.

Conclusion: LFS is an effective, easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.

Abstract: Video captioning models convert frames into visual tokens and generate descriptions with large language models (LLMs). Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering. Overall, LFS provides an effective and easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.

*Oindrila Saha,Vojtech Krs,Radomir Mech,Subhransu Maji,Matheus Gadelha,Kevin Blackburn-Matzen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing a spatial scratchpad for VLMs to improve spatial reasoning and generate accurate images by using explicit 3D reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs lack mechanisms for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to accurately reflect geometric relations and compositional intent in image generation.

Method: The framework parses text prompts into editable 3D meshes, uses agentic scene planning for placement and viewpoint selection, and renders the 3D arrangement back into images.

Result: Achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, showing better spatial consistency and visual coherence.

Conclusion: Explicit 3D reasoning enhances VLMs' ability for precise and controllable image generation, introducing a new paradigm for vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown that reasoning improves when intermediate thoughts are externalized into explicit workspaces, such as chain-of-thought traces or tool-augmented reasoning. Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation. Our results highlight a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language, but also in space. Code and visualizations at https://oindrilasaha.github.io/3DScratchpad/

### [18] [U-Harmony: Enhancing Joint Training for Segmentation Models with Universal Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14605)
*Weiwei Ma,Xiaobing Yu,Peijie Qiu,Jin Yang,Pan Xiao,Xiaoqi Zhao,Xiaofeng Liu,Tomo Miyazaki,Shinichiro Omachi,Yongsong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-Harmony is a joint training method for medical image segmentation that normalizes and denormalizes feature distributions to handle diverse datasets while preserving domain-specific knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical segmentation datasets are often limited and heterogeneous, making it difficult for existing models to generalize across domains without losing domain-specific information.

Method: The proposed Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony) integrates a domain-gated head into deep learning architectures, sequentially normalizing and denormalizing feature distributions to adapt to diverse datasets.

Result: Experiments on cross-institutional brain lesion datasets show U-Harmony's effectiveness, setting a new benchmark for robust and adaptable 3D medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: U-Harmony enables adaptable and generalizable segmentation models for real-world clinical settings by addressing dataset heterogeneity and supporting new modalities.

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical segmentation datasets are often limited and heterogeneous, with variations in modalities, protocols, and anatomical targets across institutions. Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, often sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint training method called Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), which can be integrated into deep learning-based architectures with a domain-gated head, enabling a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously. By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. More appealingly, our framework also supports universal modality adaptation, allowing the seamless learning of new imaging modalities and anatomical classes. Extensive experiments on cross-institutional brain lesion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing a new benchmark for robust and adaptable 3D medical image segmentation models in real-world clinical settings.

### [19] [Learning Consistent Taxonomic Classification through Hierarchical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14610)
*Zhenghong Li,Kecheng Zheng,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-Taxon is a two-stage framework improving hierarchical reasoning in Vision-Language Models, enhancing leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address VLMs' failure in hierarchical knowledge, causing misclassification despite accurate leaf-level identification.

Method: Two-stage approach: top-down for leaf-level accuracy, then consistency reinforcement; supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves over 10% improvement in accuracy on iNaturalist-2021, outperforming larger models with minimal fine-tuning.

Conclusion: VL-Taxon effectively enhances hierarchical reasoning in VLMs, showing significant gains with limited data.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often fail to grasp hierarchical knowledge. This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset. Notably, this significant gain was achieved by fine-tuning on just a small subset of data, without relying on any examples generated by other VLMs.

### [20] [Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14625)
*Yingsong Huang,Hui Guo,Jing Huang,Bing Bai,Qi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEUA, a framework to detect diffusion-generated images by leveraging epistemic uncertainty and an asymmetric loss function for better generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detectors for generated images ignore the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, leading to suboptimal performance. Aleatoric uncertainty adds noise, while epistemic uncertainty aids detection.

Method: Proposes DEUA, which estimates Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty (DEU) via Laplace approximation and uses an asymmetric loss function to train a balanced classifier.

Result: DEUA achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating epistemic uncertainty and asymmetric learning significantly improves detection of diffusion-generated images.

Abstract: The rapid progress of diffusion models highlights the growing need for detecting generated images. Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

TL;DR: Forest-Chat is an LLM-driven agent integrating vision-language models for forest monitoring, enabling tasks like change detection and captioning via natural language queries, evaluated on a new Forest-Change dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored integration of LLMs and VLMs for remote sensing image change interpretation in forests, enhancing monitoring workflows.

Method: Forest-Chat uses a multi-level change interpretation backbone with LLM orchestration, zero-shot detection, and interactive prompts for user guidance.

Result: Achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and LEVIR-MCI-Trees datasets for joint change detection and captioning.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven systems to improve accessibility and efficiency in forest change analysis.

Abstract: The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, together with advances in deep learning, creates new opportunities for enhancing forest monitoring workflows. Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.

### [22] [READ-Net: Clarifying Emotional Ambiguity via Adaptive Feature Recalibration for Audio-Visual Depression Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14651)
*Chenglizhao Chen,Boze Li,Mengke Song,Dehao Feng,Xinyu Liu,Shanchen Pang,Jufeng Yang,Hui Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: READ-Net is a novel audio-visual depression detection framework that resolves Emotional Ambiguity by dynamically adjusting emotional feature weights, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depression detection methods either ignore emotional cues or confuse them with depressive symptoms, leading to detection errors. Addressing Emotional Ambiguity is critical for accurate detection.

Method: The proposed READ-Net uses Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) to dynamically adjust emotional feature weights, preserving depressive-relevant cues while filtering out emotional noise.

Result: READ-Net achieves significant improvements, with average gains of 4.55% in accuracy and 1.26% in F1-score, across three datasets.

Conclusion: READ-Net effectively mitigates emotional interference, enhancing audio-visual depression detection and can be integrated into existing frameworks.

Abstract: Depression is a severe global mental health issue that impairs daily functioning and overall quality of life. Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\% in accuracy and 1.26\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.

*Yonghao Yu,Lang Huang,Zerun Wang,Runyi Li,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirai, a framework injecting future information into AR training, improves global coherence and accelerates convergence in visual generation without changing architectures or adding inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR visual generators suffer from diminished global coherence and slow convergence due to strict causality supervision. The study explores whether foresight, training signals from later tokens, can enhance AR visual generation.

Method: Mirai injects future information into AR training through explicit (Mirai-E) and implicit (Mirai-I) foresight, aligning it with AR models' internal 2D image grid representations.

Result: Mirai significantly speeds up convergence (e.g., 10x faster for LlamaGen-B) and improves generation quality (e.g., FID reduced from 5.34 to 4.34 on ImageNet).

Conclusion: Visual autoregressive models benefit from foresight, as demonstrated by Mirai's effectiveness in enhancing coherence, convergence, and generation quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) visual generators model images as sequences of discrete tokens and are trained with next token likelihood. This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning "future" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark. Our study highlights that visual autoregressive models need foresight.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using implicit geometric knowledge from a large 4D reconstruction model to improve video re-rendering, addressing issues of drift and depth inaccuracies in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video re-rendering either lack geometric awareness or rely on error-prone explicit depth estimation, leading to drift and deformation.

Method: The approach leverages implicit geometric latents from a pretrained 4D reconstruction model and source camera poses to guide the video generation process.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video re-rendering by effectively regularizing errors through the latent space.

Conclusion: Implicit geometric conditioning provides a flexible and accurate representation for video re-rendering, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Given a monocular video, the goal of video re-rendering is to generate views of the scene from a novel camera trajectory. Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.
  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates domain adaptation for cross-domain generalization in cancer histopathology, showing DANNs outperform single-domain CNNs and ensembles, with stain normalization having varied impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised models struggle with generalization across cancer types despite shared features, necessitating domain adaptation for robust performance due to limited annotated medical images.

Method: A ResNet50 is converted into a DANN to transfer knowledge from labeled to unlabeled domains, tested on lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. Stain normalization's impact is also assessed.

Result: DANNs achieve high accuracy (95.56% for lung) compared to single-domain models (<98% accuracy) and ensembles. Stain normalization's effect varies by target domain (boosts or drops accuracy).

Conclusion: DANNs enable effective cross-domain generalization in cancer histopathology, leveraging clinically relevant features, though stain normalization must be applied cautiously due to domain-specific effects.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning models often achieve excellent performance within their training distribution but struggle to generalize beyond it. In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.
  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.
  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to train implant position prediction without needing paired pre- and post-implantation CBCT data by masking implants in post-implantation scans, and presents ImplantFairy, a large-scale dataset, alongside a slope-aware prediction network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on time-consuming registration of pre- and post-implantation data, limiting multi-center dataset construction. The authors propose masking implants to use any CBCT scan for training, eliminating registration dependence.

Method: Implants are masked in post-implantation CBCT scans to create training data. A slope-aware network (RegFreeNet) with a neighboring distance perception module and slope prediction branch is designed for robust implant position prediction.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImplantFairy and two public datasets, demonstrating effectiveness without relying on paired data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach simplifies data requirements, enables large-scale multi-center datasets, and improves implant position prediction accuracy with a novel network design.

Abstract: As the commercial surgical guide design software usually does not support the export of implant position for pre-implantation data, existing methods have to scan the post-implantation data and map the implant to pre-implantation space to get the label of implant position for training. Such a process is time-consuming and heavily relies on the accuracy of registration algorithm. Moreover, not all hospitals have paired CBCT data, limitting the construction of multi-center dataset. Inspired by the way dentists determine the implant position based on the neighboring tooth texture, we found that even if the implant area is masked, it will not affect the determination of the implant position. Therefore, we propose to mask the implants in the post-implantation data so that any CBCT containing the implants can be used as training data. This paradigm enables us to discard the registration process and makes it possible to construct a large-scale multi-center implant dataset. On this basis, we proposes ImplantFairy, a comprehensive, publicly accessible dental implant dataset with voxel-level 3D annotations of 1622 CBCT data. Furthermore, according to the area variation characteristics of the tooth's spatial structure and the slope information of the implant, we designed a slope-aware implant position prediction network. Specifically, a neighboring distance perception (NDP) module is designed to adaptively extract tooth area variation features, and an implant slope prediction branch assists the network in learning more robust features through additional implant supervision information. Extensive experiments conducted on ImplantFairy and two public dataset demonstrate that the proposed RegFreeNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Method: LookBench includes real product images and AI-generated fashion images, with time-stamped samples and periodic updates for contamination-aware evaluation.

Result: Strong baselines perform poorly (<60% Recall@1), while a proprietary model and its open-source counterpart achieve state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: LookBench provides a durable, evolving benchmark for evaluating fashion image retrieval models, with public releases of data and models.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LookBench (We use the term "look" to reflect retrieval that mirrors how people shop -- finding the exact item, a close substitute, or a visually consistent alternative.), a live, holistic and challenging benchmark for fashion image retrieval in real e-commerce settings. LookBench includes both recent product images sourced from live websites and AI-generated fashion images, reflecting contemporary trends and use cases. Each test sample is time-stamped and we intend to update the benchmark periodically, enabling contamination-aware evaluation aligned with declared training cutoffs. Grounded in our fine-grained attribute taxonomy, LookBench covers single-item and outfit-level retrieval across. Our experiments reveal that LookBench poses a significant challenge on strong baselines, with many models achieving below $60\%$ Recall@1. Our proprietary model achieves the best performance on LookBench, and we release an open-source counterpart that ranks second, with both models attaining state-of-the-art results on legacy Fashion200K evaluations. LookBench is designed to be updated semi-annually with new test samples and progressively harder task variants, providing a durable measure of progress. We publicly release our leaderboard, dataset, evaluation code, and trained models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPF-CTE framework improves weakly supervised semantic segmentation by leveraging contextual patch relations and dynamic class tokens, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSSS methods lack adequate handling of contextual dependencies among image patches, leading to incomplete feature representations and limited accuracy.

Method: The CPF-CTE framework includes CF-BiLSTM for spatial dependencies and learnable class tokens for dynamic semantic refinement.

Result: CPF-CTE achieves superior performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 benchmarks.

Conclusion: CPF-CTE enhances segmentation by integrating spatial and semantic cues, proving its effectiveness over prior methods.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which relies only on image-level labels, has attracted significant attention for its cost-effectiveness and scalability. Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 validate that CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERMES is a training-free architecture for real-time video stream understanding, using hierarchical memory KV cache for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models struggle with streaming video due to stability, speed, and memory constraints.

Method: HERMES employs a hierarchical memory KV cache for compact, efficient storage and reuse of video information.

Result: HERMES achieves 10× faster TTFT, reduces video tokens by 68%, and improves accuracy by up to 11.4%.

Conclusion: HERMES enables real-time, accurate video stream understanding with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.

TL;DR: DeepMoLM is a dual-view framework for molecular language modeling that integrates high-resolution molecular images with geometric invariants, improving captioning and property prediction in drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for drug discovery and chemical literature mining often miss stereochemical details and struggle with mapping 3D structures into discrete tokens, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: DeepMoLM combines high-resolution molecular images with geometric invariants from conformations, using Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints and cross-attention to fuse visual and geometric data.

Result: The model achieves a 12.3% relative METEOR gain in PubChem captioning, valid numeric outputs for property queries, and competitive performance in specialist tasks like Molecular Weight and Complexity prediction.

Conclusion: DeepMoLM bridges the gap between visual and geometric data in molecular modeling, offering a physically grounded framework with significant improvements over generalist and specialist baselines.

Abstract: AI models for drug discovery and chemical literature mining must interpret molecular images and generate outputs consistent with 3D geometry and stereochemistry. Most molecular language models rely on strings or graphs, while vision-language models often miss stereochemical details and struggle to map continuous 3D structures into discrete tokens. We propose DeepMoLM: Deep Molecular Language M odeling, a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. DeepMoLM preserves high-frequency evidence from 1024 $\times$ 1024 inputs, encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints, and fuses visual and geometric streams with cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without atom coordinates. DeepMoLM improves PubChem captioning with a 12.3% relative METEOR gain over the strongest generalist baseline while staying competitive with specialist methods. It produces valid numeric outputs for all property queries and attains MAE 13.64 g/mol on Molecular Weight and 37.89 on Complexity in the specialist setting. On ChEBI-20 description generation from images, it exceeds generalist baselines and matches state-of- the-art vision-language models. Code is available at https://github.com/1anj/DeepMoLM.

*Liqin Wang,Qianyue Hu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoidFace is a systemic defense method targeting face swapping vulnerabilities in diffusion models, disrupting identity pathways while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about privacy and identity security due to ineffective existing defenses against face swapping led to the development of VoidFace.

Method: VoidFace disrupts face swapping by injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, degrading semantic embeddings, decoupling attention mechanisms, and corrupting diffusion features.

Result: Outperforms existing defenses across diffusion-based swapping models while preserving adversarial face quality.

Conclusion: VoidFace effectively addresses face swapping vulnerabilities with systemic disruptions and visual imperceptibility.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of diffusion models has democratized face swapping but also raises concerns about privacy and identity security. Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality. Extensive experiments show that VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based swapping models, while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.

*Chongbin Yi,Yuxin Liang,Ziqi Zhou,Peng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an end-edge collaborative framework for high-resolution text-to-image generation, balancing latency and fidelity by using hybrid super-resolution methods for different image regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between latency and image fidelity in high-resolution text-to-image generation, especially in resource-constrained edge computing environments.

Method: A framework that first generates low-resolution images at the edge, then applies region-aware hybrid super-resolution (diffusion-based for foreground, lightweight learning-based for background) to enhance image quality efficiently.

Result: The system reduces service latency by 33% compared to baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances latency and fidelity in high-resolution text-to-image generation, offering a practical solution for edge computing environments.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has made significant strides, with high-resolution text-to-image (T2I) generation becoming increasingly critical for improving users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.

Method: Introduces SimD3, a synthetic dataset featuring diverse drones, bird distractors, and varied environments. Evaluates models like YOLOv5m+C3b on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Result: SimD3 effectively supervises small-object drone detection. YOLOv5m+C3b outperforms baselines in robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: SimD3 proves valuable for training and benchmarking drone detection models under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Reliable drone detection is challenging due to limited annotated real-world data, large appearance variability, and the presence of visually similar distractors such as birds. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SimD3, a large-scale high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed for robust drone detection in complex aerial environments. Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that SimD3 provides effective supervision for small-object drone detection and that Yolov5m+C3b consistently outperforms the baseline across in-domain and cross-dataset evaluations. These findings highlight the utility of SimD3 for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse and challenging conditions.

Abstract: Interpretability is significant in computational pathology, leading to the development of multimodal information integration from histopathological image and corresponding text data.However, existing multimodal methods have limited interpretability due to the lack of high-quality dataset that support explicit reasoning and inference and simple reasoning process.To address the above problems, we introduce a novel multimodal pathology large language model with strong reasoning capabilities.To improve the generation of accurate and contextually relevant textual descriptions, we design a semantic reward strategy integrated with group relative policy optimization.We construct a high-quality pathology visual question answering (VQA) dataset, specifically designed to support complex reasoning tasks.Comprehensive experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even when trained with only 20% of the data.Our method also achieves comparable performance on downstream zero-shot image classification task compared with CLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-instance learning (MIL) approach with attention mechanisms (VEMA, DBA) and self-supervised learning (SimCLR) to identify unique polyps in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images, achieving high accuracy (86.26%) and AUC (0.928).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of identifying unique polyps in CCE images due to high image volume, clinician cognitive load, and labeling ambiguity motivates the need for automated solutions using MIL and attention mechanisms.

Method: A multi-instance verification (MIV) framework with attention mechanisms (VEMA, DBA) and self-supervised learning (SimCLR) to enhance representation extraction for polyp uniqueness detection.

Result: The model achieves 86.26% test accuracy and 0.928 AUC, with DBA L1 performing best on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients.

Conclusion: The study highlights MIL and self-supervised learning's potential for improving automated CCE image analysis, with broader applications in medical imaging.

Abstract: Identifying unique polyps in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images is a critical yet challenging task for medical personnel due to the large volume of images, the cognitive load it creates for clinicians, and the ambiguity in labeling specific frames. This paper formulates this problem as a multi-instance learning (MIL) task, where a query polyp image is compared with a target bag of images to determine uniqueness. We employ a multi-instance verification (MIV) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms, such as variance-excited multi-head attention (VEMA) and distance-based attention (DBA), to enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful representations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of self-supervised learning using SimCLR to generate robust embeddings. Experimental results on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients demonstrate that attention mechanisms significantly improve performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26\% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone with SimCLR pretraining. This study underscores the potential of MIL and self-supervised learning in advancing automated analysis of Colon Capsule Endoscopy images, with implications for broader medical imaging applications.

*Keita Takeda,Tomoya Sakai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study examines feature representations from medical vision-language models (VLMs), comparing them to non-medical VLMs to assess diagnostic relevance and the impact of medical specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding medical VLM feature representations is crucial for improving medical image analysis and ensuring they capture diagnostically relevant features.

Method: Analyzed feature distributions from medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets and compared them with non-medical VLMs.

Result: Medical VLMs extract discriminative features for medical tasks, but non-medical VLMs with contextual enrichment (e.g., LLM2CLIP) produce more refined representations. Text encoder enhancement is more critical than intensive medical image training.

Conclusion: Model selection for medical tasks requires careful consideration of downstream tasks and risks like textual biases in images.

Abstract: This study investigates the feature representations produced by publicly available open source medical vision-language models (VLMs). While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FunCineForge addresses limitations in movie dubbing by proposing a dataset pipeline and MLLM-based model, outperforming SOTA methods in quality and sync.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dubbing datasets are limited and models rely on lip regions only, hindering performance in complex scenes.

Method: FunCineForge includes an end-to-end dataset pipeline and MLLM-based model for diverse scenes.

Result: The model outperforms SOTA in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

Conclusion: FunCineForge improves dubbing quality and scalability, demonstrated by a high-quality Chinese TV dataset.

Abstract: Movie dubbing is the task of synthesizing speech from scripts conditioned on video scenes, requiring accurate lip sync, faithful timbre transfer, and proper modeling of character identity and emotion. However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show that our dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

*Yifei Liu,Changxing Ding,Ling Guo,Huaiguang Jiang,Qiong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAM introduces a motion latent space and Reconstructive Error Guidance to address limitations in motion diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion diffusion models suffer from a representational gap due to text encoders lacking motion-specific information and error propagation during denoising.

Method: RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with self-regularization and latent alignment objectives. It also proposes Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG) to mitigate error propagation during testing.

Result: RAM shows significant improvements and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: RAM effectively addresses key limitations in motion diffusion models and sets a new benchmark for text-to-motion generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have seen widespread adoption for text-driven human motion generation and related tasks due to their impressive generative capabilities and flexibility. However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of training data for deep learning in archaeological artifact classification, especially rare Chinese porcelain, by leveraging synthetic images.

Method: Employed MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, comparing models trained on pure real data vs. mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln, and type identification.

Result: Task-specific improvements: type classification showed the highest F1-macro increase (5.5% with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks had modest gains (3-4%).

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation effectiveness depends on task-relevant visual features, offering practical guidelines for generative AI in archaeology while balancing authenticity and diversity.

Abstract: The scarcity of training data presents a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to archaeological artifact classification, particularly for the rare types of Chinese porcelain. This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures. Our work contributes practical guidelines for deploying generative AI in archaeological research, demonstrating both the potential and limitations of synthetic data when archaeological authenticity must be balanced with data diversity.

*Qingling Shu,Sibao Chen,Wei Lu,Zhihui You,Chengzhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniRoute is a unified framework for modality-adaptive remote sensing change detection, addressing limitations of specialized models by using conditional routing for feature extraction and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current change detection methods lack scalability across different modalities due to reliance on specialized models and fixed difference operations, which fail in cross-modal or misaligned scenarios.

Method: Introduces UniRoute with Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) for disentangling spatial details and context, Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) for adaptive fusion, and Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) for stable training.

Result: UniRoute achieves strong performance on five public datasets, offering a good balance between accuracy and efficiency under unified deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses modality adaptability in change detection, outperforming specialized models and demonstrating scalability.

Abstract: Current remote sensing change detection (CD) methods mainly rely on specialized models, which limits the scalability toward modality-adaptive Earth observation. For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that UniRoute achieves strong overall performance, with a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off under a unified deployment setting.

TL;DR: A new approach combines symmetry-aware and symmetry-agnostic features from semantic descriptors, addressing noise and misclassification issues in previous methods, validated through extensive experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve symmetry-aware shape descriptors by addressing limitations like noise and one-dimensional features in existing methods.

Method: Proposes a feature disentanglement approach for symmetry-informative and symmetry-agnostic features, along with a refinement technique for robustness.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in tasks like symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances symmetry-aware descriptors, proving its superiority in various shape analysis tasks.

Abstract: Shape descriptors, i.e., per-vertex features of 3D meshes or point clouds, are fundamental to shape analysis. Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $χ$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic. Further, we propose a feature refinement technique to improve the robustness of predicted symmetry informative features. Extensive experiments, including intrinsic symmetry detection, left/right classification, and shape matching, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to various state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: POTR is a post-training codec for 3DGS that reduces storage needs and accelerates inference via efficient pruning and entropy reduction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS offers faster training and inference than NeRF but requires more storage. POTR addresses this by optimizing 3DGS post-training.

Method: POTR uses novel pruning with a modified rasterizer and recomputes lighting coefficients to reduce entropy. It also includes fine-tuning for further enhancement.

Result: POTR achieves 2-4x fewer splats, 1.5-2x faster inference, and increases AC lighting sparsity from 70% to 97% with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: POTR outperforms other post-training compression methods in rate-distortion and inference speed, even without fine-tuning.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising contender to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. 3DGS outperforms NeRF in training and inference speed but has substantially higher storage requirements. To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality. Finally, we extend POTR with a simple fine-tuning scheme to further enhance pruning, inference, and rate-distortion performance. Experiments demonstrate that POTR, even without fine-tuning, consistently outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in both rate-distortion performance and inference speed.

Abstract: Melanoma detection is vital for early diagnosis and effective treatment. While deep learning models on dermoscopic images have shown promise, they require specialized equipment, limiting their use in broader clinical settings. This study introduces a multi-modal melanoma detection system using conventional photo images, making it more accessible and versatile. Our system integrates image data with tabular metadata, such as patient demographics and lesion characteristics, to improve detection accuracy.

A three-stage pipeline further refines predictions by boosting algorithms and enhancing performance. To address the challenges of a highly imbalanced dataset, specific techniques were implemented to ensure robust training. An ablation study evaluated recent vision architectures, boosting algorithms, and loss functions, achieving a peak Partial ROC AUC of 0.18068 (0.2 maximum) and top-15 retrieval sensitivity of 0.78371. Results demonstrate that integrating photo images with metadata in a structured, multi-stage pipeline yields significant performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of microtubule networks is challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and noise, necessitating advanced methods for studying their organization and dynamics.

Method: MTFlow uses a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings to learn vector fields that iteratively refine noisy masks toward the ground truth, capturing dynamics of uncertainty resolution.

Result: MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy on synthetic, real microtubule, and public biomedical datasets, surpassing manual or semi-automatic approaches in precision.

Conclusion: MTFlow offers a powerful, time-efficient solution for filamentous structure analysis, providing more precise segmentations than conventional methods.

Abstract: Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that play essential roles in many cellular processes and are key therapeutic targets in several diseases. Accurate segmentation of microtubule networks is critical for studying their organization and dynamics but remains challenging due to filament curvature, dense crossings, and image noise. We present MTFlow, a novel time-conditioned flow-matching model for microtubule segmentation. Unlike conventional U-Net variants that predict masks in a single pass, MTFlow learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward the ground truth, enabling interpretable, trajectory-based refinement. Our architecture combines a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings, allowing the model to capture the dynamics of uncertainty resolution along filament boundaries. We trained and evaluated MTFlow on synthetic and real microtubule datasets and assessed its generalization capability on public biomedical datasets of curvilinear structures such as retinal blood vessels and nerves. MTFlow achieves competitive segmentation accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models, offering a powerful and time-efficient tool for filamentous structure analysis with more precise annotations than manual or semi-automatic approaches.

TL;DR: GAT-NeRF improves 4D facial avatar reconstruction by combining MLP with a Transformer module to enhance high-frequency details like wrinkles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driven by the need for immersive virtual humans, addressing limitations of NeRF in capturing fine facial details from monocular video.

Method: Proposes GAT-NeRF, integrating a Geometry-Aware-Transformer with NeRF using multi-modal inputs (3D coordinates, 3DMM parameters, latent codes) to enhance feature learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity and detail recovery, especially for dynamic wrinkles and textures.

Conclusion: GAT-NeRF advances realistic dynamic digital human creation for multimedia applications.

Abstract: High-fidelity 4D dynamic facial avatar reconstruction from monocular video is a critical yet challenging task, driven by increasing demands for immersive virtual human applications. While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars. Comprehensive experiments unequivocally demonstrate GAT-NeRF's state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, forging new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications.

TL;DR: SpatialMem is a memory-centric system integrating 3D geometry, semantics, and language into a queryable representation from RGB video, enabling tasks like navigation and object retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified system for embodied spatial intelligence that efficiently links 3D environments with language and semantics.

Method: Reconstructs indoor scenes from RGB video, detects structural anchors, and builds a hierarchical memory with visual and textual data linked to 3D coordinates.

Result: Achieves strong navigation and retrieval accuracy despite clutter and occlusion in real-life indoor scenes.

Conclusion: SpatialMem provides an efficient, extensible framework for spatial reasoning and embodied AI tasks.

Abstract: We present SpatialMem, a memory-centric system that unifies 3D geometry, semantics, and language into a single, queryable representation. Starting from casually captured egocentric RGB video, SpatialMem reconstructs metrically scaled indoor environments, detects structural 3D anchors (walls, doors, windows) as the first-layer scaffold, and populates a hierarchical memory with open-vocabulary object nodes -- linking evidence patches, visual embeddings, and two-layer textual descriptions to 3D coordinates -- for compact storage and fast retrieval. This design enables interpretable reasoning over spatial relations (e.g., distance, direction, visibility) and supports downstream tasks such as language-guided navigation and object retrieval without specialized sensors. Experiments across three real-life indoor scenes demonstrate that SpatialMem maintains strong anchor-description-level navigation completion and hierarchical retrieval accuracy under increasing clutter and occlusion, offering an efficient and extensible framework for embodied spatial intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EroSeg-AT improves adversarial training robustness by generating adversarial examples with contextual semantic disruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training lacks consideration of contextual semantic relationships, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Proposes EroSeg-AT, using EroSeg to select sensitive pixels and propagate perturbations to disrupt semantic consistency.

Result: EroSeg-AT outperforms existing methods in attack effectiveness and model robustness.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances adversarial training by leveraging contextual semantics.

Abstract: Existing segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks.To improve robustness, adversarial training incorporates adversarial examples into model training. However, existing attack methods consider only global semantic information and ignore contextual semantic relationships within the samples, limiting the effectiveness of adversarial training. To address this issue, we propose EroSeg-AT, a vulnerability-aware adversarial training framework that leverages EroSeg to generate adversarial examples. EroSeg first selects sensitive pixels based on pixel-level confidence and then progressively propagates perturbations to higher-confidence pixels, effectively disrupting the semantic consistency of the samples. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our approach significantly improves attack effectiveness and enhances model robustness under adversarial training.

### [49] [TempViz: On the Evaluation of Temporal Knowledge in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14951)
*Carolin Holtermann,Nina Krebs,Anne Lauscher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TempViz, a dataset to evaluate temporal knowledge in text-to-image models, revealing weak temporal competence and unreliable automated evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding temporal phenomena in text-to-image generation is understudied, despite its importance for contextually accurate images.

Method: TempViz dataset (7.9k prompts, 600+ images) evaluates five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories using human and automated methods.

Result: Temporal competence in models is weak (<75% accuracy), and automated evaluations fail to reliably assess temporal cues.

Conclusion: Future research is urgently needed to improve temporal knowledge in T2I models and develop better evaluation methods.

Abstract: Time alters the visual appearance of entities in our world, like objects, places, and animals. Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I.

TL;DR: LDF-VFI introduces a video-centric framework for frame interpolation using diffusion transformers and skip-concatenate sampling to improve temporal coherence and handle long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods process videos as independent segments, causing temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. LDF-VFI aims to ensure long-range temporal coherence.

Method: Uses an auto-regressive diffusion transformer, skip-concatenate sampling, sparse local attention, tiled VAE encoding, and an enhanced conditional VAE decoder.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-sequence benchmarks with high per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially for large motion scenes.

Conclusion: LDF-VFI provides a robust solution for video frame interpolation, ensuring coherence and efficiency for long sequences and high resolutions.

Abstract: Existing video frame interpolation (VFI) methods often adopt a frame-centric approach, processing videos as independent short segments (e.g., triplets), which leads to temporal inconsistencies and motion artifacts. To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{F}orcing for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{F}rame \textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

### [51] [Unified Multi-Dataset Training for TBPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14978)
*Nilanjana Chatterjee,Sidharatha Garg,A V Subramanyam,Brejesh Lall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scale-TBPS is introduced as a unified model for Text-Based Person Search (TBPS), overcoming limitations of dataset-specific fine-tuning and noisy data by merging datasets and scalable learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TBPS methods rely on dataset-specific fine-tuning due to limited training data and VLMs not being pre-trained for pedestrian-centric tasks. Synthetic data doesn't solve dataset adaptation issues.

Method: Proposes Scale-TBPS with (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework.

Result: Outperforms dataset-centric models and naive joint training on multiple datasets (CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, UFine6926).

Conclusion: A single unified Scale-TBPS model is feasible and superior, addressing challenges of multi-dataset training and noisy data.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) has seen significant progress with vision-language models (VLMs), yet it remains constrained by limited training data and the fact that VLMs are not inherently pre-trained for pedestrian-centric recognition. Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 demonstrate that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiViBench introduces the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, featuring 24 diverse tasks. A semi-automatic annotation workflow and a tailored MLLM (LiVi-LLM-7B) are developed, showing superior performance over larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video benchmarks focus on non-interactive content, leaving a gap for interactive livestream videos. This paper aims to address this by creating a comprehensive benchmark and improving model capabilities for interactive video understanding.

Method: The paper designs a semi-automatic annotation workflow using a multi-agent system for video description and seed-question-driven annotations. It also introduces a two-stage instruction-tuning approach and a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module for enhanced understanding.

Result: LiVi-LLM-7B outperforms larger open-source models (up to 72B parameters) and narrows the gap with proprietary models on LiViBench. It also shows improved performance on general video benchmarks like VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and model advancements successfully address the challenges of interactive livestream videos, demonstrating superior performance and broader applicability to general video understanding tasks.

Abstract: The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has advanced general video understanding. However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BinauralVGGSound, a large-scale video-binaural audio dataset, and a framework for spatially aware video-to-audio generation, improving spatial fidelity and immersive quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-to-audio generation models lack spatial perception due to reliance on mono audio datasets, limiting immersive quality.

Method: The authors propose a visual-guided spatial audio generation framework and construct BinauralVGGSound, a dataset with binaural spatial information.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment.

Conclusion: The framework enhances immersive auditory experiences, and all resources will be publicly released for future research.

Abstract: While video-to-audio generation has achieved remarkable progress in semantic and temporal alignment, most existing studies focus solely on these aspects, paying limited attention to the spatial perception and immersive quality of the synthesized audio. This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency. All datasets, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A federated learning framework for brain tumor localization enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive data, matching centralized model performance and highlighting the importance of distributed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of siloed brain tumor datasets in healthcare due to privacy regulations by enabling collaborative training without data sharing.

Method: Extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture, deployed in CERN's federated learning platform (CAFEIN®), with explainability through Transformer attention mechanisms.

Result: Federated learning outperforms isolated training, matching centralized performance. Deeper network layers increase attention to T2 and FLAIR MRI modalities (p<0.001).

Conclusion: Federated learning is highly effective for complex tasks like brain tumor analysis, leveraging distributed data while maintaining privacy, with explainability aligning with clinical practice.

Abstract: Deep learning models for brain tumor analysis require large and diverse datasets that are often siloed across healthcare institutions due to privacy regulations. We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new generative Flow Matching (FM)-based deep leakage (DL) attack in Federated Learning (FL) outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating higher fidelity and robustness across various conditions and defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL attacks in FL are unstable or lack fidelity under realistic settings, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: Integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into DL attacks to guide optimization toward realistic image distributions, improving reconstruction fidelity.

Result: Outperforms current DL attacks across multiple similarity metrics and remains effective under various conditions (training epochs, batch sizes) and defenses (noise, clipping, sparsification).

Conclusion: Highlights the need for new FL defenses to counter adversaries leveraging powerful generative priors.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized model training, yet it remains vulnerable to deep leakage (DL) attacks that reconstruct private client data from shared model updates. While prior DL methods have demonstrated varying levels of success, they often suffer from instability, limited fidelity, or poor robustness under realistic FL settings. We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification. Our findings call for the development of new defense strategies that explicitly account for adversaries equipped with powerful generative priors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data masking techniques fail to balance privacy and utility effectively, necessitating a better approach for privacy-preserving machine learning.

Method: The framework employs EFSGD, reconstruction loss, and noise injection to enhance synthetic data generation while maintaining privacy.

Result: The method produces higher-quality images under the same privacy budget and achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the privacy-utility trade-off, demonstrating superior performance and generalization across different image datasets.

Abstract: Traditional data masking techniques such as anonymization cannot achieve the expected privacy protection while ensuring data utility for privacy-preserving machine learning. Synthetic data plays an increasingly important role as it generates a large number of training samples and prevents information leakage in real data. The existing methods suffer from the repeating trade-off processes between privacy and utility. We propose a novel framework for differential privacy generation, which employs an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent(EFSGD) method and introduces a reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism into the training process. We generate images with higher quality and usability under the same privacy budget as the related work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework for both grayscale and RGB images. We achieve state-of-the-art results over almost all metrics on three benchmarks: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA.

*Tianyu Li,Songyue Cai,Zongqian Wu,Ping Hu,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a plug-and-play framework to enhance CLIP-based FG-BG decomposition methods by addressing limitations in uniform background suppression and foreground patch confusion, improving few-shot OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG decomposition methods have limitations: uniform background suppression ignores varying patch contributions, and foreground patches with appearance/semantic similarities to other classes can mislead training.

Method: The framework includes three modules: (1) FG-BG Decomposition, (2) Adaptive Background Suppression (weights patch entropy), and (3) Confusable Foreground Rectification (identifies/rectifies misleading patches).

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework significantly boosts performance of existing FG-BG methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves FG-BG decomposition for few-shot OOD detection, offering adaptability and rectification for better results.

Abstract: CLIP-based foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in improving few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction by proposing PictorialCortex, a model that handles variability in neural responses using compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training, validated on UniCortex-fMRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of decoding visual experiences from brain activity is complicated by variability across individuals and trials. This paper aims to solve zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction without subject-specific training.

Method: PictorialCortex uses a compositional latent formulation to structure stimulus-driven representations under variability factors. It employs latent factorization, consistency regularization, and aggregates surrogate latents for diffusion-based image synthesis.

Result: PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, demonstrating the effectiveness of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of compositional latent modeling and standardized datasets like UniCortex-fMRI for advancing cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction.

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from human brain activity remains a central challenge at the intersection of neuroscience, neuroimaging, and artificial intelligence. A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization--composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of traditional physics-based methods and existing GNNs in garment simulation, particularly poor cross-resolution generalization and high computational costs.

Method: Developed Pb4U-GNet, featuring dynamic propagation depth control and geometry-aware update scaling to adapt to varying mesh resolutions.

Result: Pb4U-GNet shows strong generalization across mesh resolutions, even when trained only on low-resolution meshes.

Conclusion: Pb4U-GNet effectively addresses key challenges in neural garment simulation, offering a scalable and adaptable solution.

Abstract: Garment simulation is fundamental to various applications in computer vision and graphics, from virtual try-on to digital human modelling. However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited by scarce training data and lack interpretability, prompting the need for a more reliable and transparent approach.

Method: MARS employs a three-step process: objective video description, evidence-based reasoning for hateful content, and counter-evidence reasoning for non-hateful perspectives, culminating in a conclusive decision.

Result: MARS achieves up to 10% improvement over other training-free methods and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset, with human-understandable justifications.

Conclusion: MARS provides a reliable, interpretable solution for hateful video detection, enhancing transparency in content moderation.

Abstract: Hateful videos pose serious risks by amplifying discrimination, inciting violence, and undermining online safety. Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the robustness of promptable segmentation models like SAM to natural variations in bounding box prompts, revealing sensitivity to prompt noise and introducing BREPS for adversarial robustness evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the effectiveness of bounding box prompts in segmentation models, current protocols use synthetic prompts, limiting insights into real-world robustness. The study aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors conduct a user study to collect real bounding box annotations and analyze variability. They introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes under naturalness constraints to evaluate robustness.

Result: Findings show significant variability in segmentation quality due to prompt noise. BREPS benchmarks models across 10 datasets, demonstrating robustness challenges.

Conclusion: The study highlights the sensitivity of promptable segmentation models to natural prompt variations and provides a tool (BREPS) for rigorous robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation models such as SAM have established a powerful paradigm, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and domains with minimal user input, including points, bounding boxes, and text prompts. Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging. Code - https://github.com/emb-ai/BREPS.

*Jianshu Zhang,Chengxuan Qian,Haosen Sun,Haoran Lu,Dingcheng Wang,Letian Xue,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates VLMs' ability to infer task progress from partial observations, introducing Progress-Bench for benchmarking and ProgressLM-45K for training. Results show most VLMs struggle with progress estimation, but a training-based approach (ProgressLM-3B) improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can infer task progress, a capability requiring long-horizon reasoning, which current VLMs may lack.

Method: Introduces Progress-Bench for evaluation and explores a two-stage progress reasoning paradigm using training-free prompting and a training-based approach (ProgressLM-3B) with ProgressLM-45K.

Result: Most VLMs perform poorly on progress estimation, sensitive to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes. ProgressLM-3B improves performance despite being trained on disjoint tasks.

Conclusion: Progress reasoning in VLMs is challenging, but structured training-based approaches like ProgressLM-3B show promise, highlighting the need for further research.

Abstract: Estimating task progress requires reasoning over long-horizon dynamics rather than recognizing static visual content. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations. To this end, we introduce Progress-Bench, a benchmark for systematically evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs. Beyond benchmarking, we further explore a human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach based on curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks. Further analyses reveal characteristic error patterns and clarify when and why progress reasoning succeeds or fails.

*André Eberhard,Gerhard Neumann,Pascal Friederich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraSP, a unified method for visual graph recognition, addressing the lack of transferable solutions in the field by using subgraph prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for visual graph recognition lack transferability between tasks, despite the conceptual similarity of the problems. The goal is to create a broadly applicable and simple solution.

Method: The proposed method, GraSP (Graph Recognition via Subgraph Prediction), recognizes graphs in images by leveraging subgraph prediction, without requiring task-specific modifications.

Result: GraSP demonstrates versatility across synthetic benchmarks and a real-world application, successfully handling diverse graph types and drawings.

Conclusion: GraSP provides a unified and transferable framework for visual graph recognition, overcoming the limitations of existing task-specific approaches.

Abstract: Despite tremendous improvements in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, the recognition of visual relationships, commonly modeled as the extraction of a graph from an image, remains a challenging task. We believe that this mainly stems from the fact that there is no canonical way to approach the visual graph recognition task. Most existing solutions are specific to a problem and cannot be transferred between different contexts out-of-the box, even though the conceptual problem remains the same. With broad applicability and simplicity in mind, in this paper we develop a method, \textbf{Gra}ph Recognition via \textbf{S}ubgraph \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{GraSP}), for recognizing graphs in images. We show across several synthetic benchmarks and one real-world application that our method works with a set of diverse types of graphs and their drawings, and can be transferred between tasks without task-specific modifications, paving the way to a more unified framework for visual graph recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bibliometric tools lack semantic insights into research themes' evolution and interdisciplinary influence, prompting a need for deeper analysis.

Method: Compiled 100K+ papers from 22 conferences (2020-2025), using topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval for multidimensional profiling.

Result: Identified shifts like growth in safety and multimodal reasoning, stabilization in neural machine translation, and insights into dataset/model usage patterns.

Conclusion: Provides evidence-based insights into AI research evolution, aiding trend analysis and emerging direction identification.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research across machine learning, vision, and language has produced a volume of publications that is increasingly difficult to synthesize. Traditional bibliometric tools rely mainly on metadata and offer limited visibility into the semantic content of papers, making it hard to track how research themes evolve over time or how different areas influence one another. To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content. By combining topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval, we derive a comprehensive representation of research activity that supports the study of topic lifecycles, methodological transitions, dataset and model usage patterns, and institutional research directions. Our analysis highlights several notable shifts, including the growth of safety, multimodal reasoning, and agent-oriented studies, as well as the gradual stabilization of areas such as neural machine translation and graph-based methods. These findings provide an evidence-based view of how AI research is evolving and offer a resource for understanding broader trends and identifying emerging directions.

TL;DR: PMPose and BMPv2 improve crowded scene pose estimation, with BMPv2 surpassing state-of-the-art results on COCO and OCHuman datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the saturation in 2D human pose estimation benchmarks, particularly in crowded scenes.

Method: Introducing PMPose with probabilistic formulation and mask-conditioning, and BMPv2 integrating PMPose with SAM-based mask refinement.

Result: BMPv2 exceeds state-of-the-art by 1.5 AP on COCO and 6 AP on OCHuman, surpassing 50 AP on OCHuman.

Conclusion: Advances in 2D pose estimation directly benefit 3D estimation, with pose accuracy impacting multi-person performance more than detection.

Abstract: Most 2D human pose estimation benchmarks are nearly saturated, with the exception of crowded scenes. We introduce PMPose, a top-down 2D pose estimator that incorporates the probabilistic formulation and the mask-conditioning. PMPose improves crowded pose estimation without sacrificing performance on standard scenes. Building on this, we present BBoxMaskPose v2 (BMPv2) integrating PMPose and an enhanced SAM-based mask refinement module. BMPv2 surpasses state-of-the-art by 1.5 average precision (AP) points on COCO and 6 AP points on OCHuman, becoming the first method to exceed 50 AP on OCHuman. We demonstrate that BMP's 2D prompting of 3D model improves 3D pose estimation in crowded scenes and that advances in 2D pose quality directly benefit 3D estimation. Results on the new OCHuman-Pose dataset show that multi-person performance is more affected by pose prediction accuracy than by detection.

Motivation: Early and accurate classification of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for timely intervention and better patient outcomes.

Method: Evaluated five CNN and five Transformer models, plus a hybrid model (Evan_V2) combining CNN and Transformer outputs via feature-level fusion, on a four-class AD classification task.

Result: CNNs performed well (ResNet50: 98.83%), Transformers showed competitive generalization (ViT: 95.38%), and Evan_V2 outperformed all with 99.99% accuracy.

Conclusion: Hybrid ensemble strategies like Evan_V2 can enhance diagnostic reliability for Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Early and accurate classification of Alzheimers disease (AD) from brain MRI scans is essential for timely clinical intervention and improved patient outcomes. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of five CNN architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV3, VGG16), five Transformer-based models (ViT, ConvTransformer, PatchTransformer, MLP-Mixer, SimpleTransformer), and a proposed hybrid model named Evan_V2. All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed that Evan_V2 substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages, outperforming every standalone model. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid ensemble strategies in producing highly reliable and clinically meaningful diagnostic tools for Alzheimers disease classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenDi integrates 3D and 2D diffusion models to generate realistic urban scenes, addressing limitations of appearance details and camera controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with balancing appearance details and camera controllability, prompting the development of ScenDi.

Method: Combines 3D latent diffusion for coarse scene generation and 2D video diffusion for detail enhancement.

Result: Effective generation of realistic urban scenes while adhering to input conditions and camera trajectories.

Conclusion: ScenDi outperforms existing methods on datasets like Waymo and KITTI-360.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object generation using diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, but generating realistic 3D urban scenes remains challenging. Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets, Waymo and KITTI-360, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper presents an end-to-end pipeline for automated detection of cervical spine fractures in 3D CT volumes using 2D projections, achieving high performance with reduced computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical spine fractures require precise detection for effective clinical management, but traditional 3D segmentation methods are computationally intensive. This study aims to simplify the process using optimized 2D projections.

Method: The pipeline combines YOLOv8 for 2D projection-based vertebra localization, DenseNet121-Unet for multi-label segmentation, and an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models for fracture detection using raw slices and projections.

Result: Achieves 3D mIoU of 94.45% for localization, Dice score of 87.86% for segmentation, and competitive F1 and ROC-AUC scores (vertebra-level: 68.15 F1, 91.62 AUC; patient-level: 82.26 F1, 83.04 AUC).

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates high performance and computational efficiency, validated by explainability studies and interobserver analysis, making it a viable alternative to traditional 3D methods.

Abstract: Cervical spine fractures are critical medical conditions requiring precise and efficient detection for effective clinical management. This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.

TL;DR: FlowSSC is a generative framework for Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images, combining conditional generation with feed-forward methods to improve performance and enable real-time inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feed-forward methods for SSC struggle with generating plausible details in occluded regions and maintaining spatial relationships, which are crucial for real-world applications.

Method: FlowSCC treats SSC as a conditional generation problem, integrates with existing feed-forward methods, and uses Shortcut Flow-matching in a triplane latent space for efficient, high-fidelity generation in a single step.

Result: FlowSCC achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: FlowSCC effectively addresses the challenges of SSC by leveraging generative reasoning and efficient inference, making it suitable for practical deployment in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) from monocular RGB images is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity of inferring occluded 3D geometry from a single view. While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack high-fidelity digital twins, limiting systematic testing and sim-to-real evaluations. DrivIng addresses this gap.

Method: The dataset includes continuous recordings from RGB cameras, LiDAR, and high-precision localization, annotated with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs.

Result: DrivIng provides ~1.2 million annotated instances and enables realistic scenario testing via a digital twin.

Conclusion: DrivIng supports reproducible research, robust validation, and benchmarked perception models, publicly released for broader use.

Abstract: Perception is a cornerstone of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to understand their surroundings and make safe, reliable decisions. Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing. To support reproducible research and robust validation, we benchmark DrivIng with state-of-the-art perception models and publicly release the dataset, digital twin, HD map, and codebase.

*Yu Wu,Minsik Jeon,Jen-Hao Rick Chang,Oncel Tuzel,Shubham Tulsiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayRoPE is a novel positional encoding method for multi-view transformers, addressing SE(3)-invariant attention and geometry-awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing positional encoding schemes for multi-view attention fail to uniquely encode patches, achieve SE(3)-invariant attention, or adapt to scene geometry.

Method: RayRoPE leverages ray-associated patch positions with predicted 3D points, computes query-frame projective coordinates for SE(3) invariance, and handles uncertainty analytically.

Result: RayRoPE improves novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation (e.g.,15% relative LPIPS improvement in CO3D) and integrates RGB-D inputs effectively.

Conclusion: RayRoPE outperforms alternatives in encoding positionally aware multi-view transformer tokens.

Abstract: We study positional encodings for multi-view transformers that process tokens from a set of posed input images, and seek a mechanism that encodes patches uniquely, allows SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and can be adaptive to the geometry of the underlying scene. We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.

TL;DR: StableWorld introduces a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism to address instability and temporal degradation in interactive video generation by filtering degraded frames, improving consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interactive video generation methods suffer from instability and temporal degradation, causing spatial drift and scene collapse.

Method: Proposes StableWorld with a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism to filter degraded frames and retain geometrically consistent ones.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness across multiple models (Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, Hunyuan-GameCraft), improving stability and generalization.

Conclusion: StableWorld is model-agnostic and enhances interactive video generation by preventing error accumulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the overlooked challenge of stability and temporal consistency in interactive video generation, which synthesizes dynamic and controllable video worlds through interactive behaviors such as camera movements and text prompts. Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of standardized benchmarks and high-quality training data for generating realistic robotic videos.

Method: Introducing RBench for evaluation across domains and embodiments, and RoVid-X, a dataset with 4M annotated clips.

Result: RBench reveals deficiencies in current models and correlates highly (0.96) with human evaluations. RoVid-X enhances training data.

Conclusion: The combination of RBench and RoVid-X provides a foundation for better evaluation and training of video models, advancing embodied AI.

Abstract: Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance indoor scene lighting editing by decomposing complex illumination into controllable light sources and ensuring consistency across views.

Method: Uses generative image-based light decomposition, multi-view lighting harmonization, and integrates with relightable 3D Gaussian splatting for real-time control.

Result: Achieves photorealistic lighting decomposition and relighting, validated on synthetic and real datasets with comparisons to state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The method effectively enables interactive light manipulation in indoor scenes, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for interactive light editing in indoor scenes from a single multi-view scene capture. Our method leverages a generative image-based light decomposition model that factorizes complex indoor scene illumination into its constituent light sources. This factorization enables independent manipulation of individual light sources, specifically allowing control over their state (on/off), chromaticity, and intensity. We further introduce multi-view lighting harmonization to ensure consistent propagation of the lighting decomposition across all scene views. This is integrated into a relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation, providing real-time interactive control over the individual light sources. Our results demonstrate highly photorealistic lighting decomposition and relighting outcomes across diverse indoor scenes. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets and provide a quantitative and qualitative comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: What if a video generation model could not only imagine a plausible future, but the correct one, accurately reflecting how the world changes with each action? We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an iterative test-time strategy for text-to-image models, using feedback from a vision-language model to refine generations, improving prompt alignment and compositional accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex prompts requiring handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes, prompting the need for better inference-time strategies.

Method: An iterative refinement approach where a text-to-image model progressively improves generations using feedback from a vision-language critic model.

Result: The method improves generation accuracy significantly across benchmarks (e.g., 16.9% on ConceptMix) and is preferred by human evaluators 58.7% of the time.

Conclusion: Iterative self-correction is a broadly applicable principle for enhancing compositional image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable progress, yet they continue to struggle with complex prompts that require simultaneously handling multiple objects, relations, and attributes. Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores quantization methods (GPTQ, AWQ) for multimodal pipelines (ViT, LLM), showing ViT and LLM are equally crucial despite size differences, with LLM quantization being highly efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce memory and latency in multimodal pipelines while preserving performance by applying quantization methods.

Method: Investigates various quantization techniques (GPTQ, AWQ) on multimodal pipelines (vision models, language models, connectors), analyzing impact on tasks like captioning, retrieval, and QA.

Result: ViT and LLM are equally important for performance; LLM quantization achieves high accuracy at lower bits per weight (bpw).

Conclusion: Provides insights for efficient MLLM deployment and highlights component sensitivity exploration in multimodal models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results for a variety of tasks, but state-of-the-art systems require fast GPUs with large amounts of memory. To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

### [79] [APPLE: Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling for Diffusion-Based Face Swapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15288)
*Jiwon Kang,Yeji Choi,JoungBin Lee,Wooseok Jang,Jinhyeok Choi,Taekeun Kang,Yongjae Park,Myungin Kim,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APPLE, a diffusion-based teacher-student framework, improves face swapping by preserving target-specific attributes and achieving accurate identity transfer through pseudo-label supervision and conditional deblurring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face swapping faces challenges in preserving target-specific attributes (e.g., pose, lighting, skin tone) due to lack of real ground truth and misalignment issues in diffusion-based methods.

Method: Proposes APPLE, a framework using attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision and conditional deblurring, with an attribute-aware inversion scheme for detailed preservation.

Result: APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing photorealistic and target-faithful results.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations in face swapping, enhancing both attribute fidelity and identity transfer quality.

Abstract: Face swapping aims to transfer the identity of a source face onto a target face while preserving target-specific attributes such as pose, expression, lighting, skin tone, and makeup. However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision. Overall, APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful results.

*Pouria Mortezaagha,Joseph Shaw,Bowen Sun,Arya Rahgozar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a schema-constrained AI system for extracting structured data from biomedical PDFs, addressing challenges like OCR errors and fragmentation. It ensures auditability and scalability for evidence synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual extraction of variables from biomedical PDFs is time-consuming and error-prone. Existing AI systems lack scalability, throughput, and auditability, necessitating a more reliable solution.

Method: The system uses typed schemas, controlled vocabularies, and evidence-gated decisions to process PDFs. It employs resume-aware hashing, caption-aware chunking, and conflict-aware consolidation for traceable outputs.

Result: The pipeline processed documents without manual intervention, maintained stable throughput, and improved extraction fidelity for key variables like assay classification and outcome definitions.

Conclusion: Schema-constrained AI extraction transforms complex PDFs into structured, auditable evidence, meeting the reliability and transparency needs of biomedical research synthesis.

Abstract: Biomedical evidence synthesis relies on accurate extraction of methodological, laboratory, and outcome variables from full-text research articles, yet these variables are embedded in complex scientific PDFs that make manual abstraction time-consuming and difficult to scale. Existing document AI systems remain limited by OCR errors, long-document fragmentation, constrained throughput, and insufficient auditability for high-stakes synthesis. We present a schema-constrained AI extraction system that transforms full-text biomedical PDFs into structured, analysis-ready records by explicitly restricting model inference through typed schemas, controlled vocabularies, and evidence-gated decisions. Documents are ingested using resume-aware hashing, partitioned into caption-aware page-level chunks, and processed asynchronously under explicit concurrency controls. Chunk-level outputs are deterministically merged into study-level records using conflict-aware consolidation, set-based aggregation, and sentence-level provenance to support traceability and post-hoc audit. Evaluated on a corpus of studies on direct oral anticoagulant level measurement, the pipeline processed all documents without manual intervention, maintained stable throughput under service constraints, and exhibited strong internal consistency across document chunks. Iterative schema refinement substantially improved extraction fidelity for synthesis-critical variables, including assay classification, outcome definitions, follow-up duration, and timing of measurement. These results demonstrate that schema-constrained, provenance-aware extraction enables scalable and auditable transformation of heterogeneous scientific PDFs into structured evidence, aligning modern document AI with the transparency and reliability requirements of biomedical evidence synthesis.

### [81] [The Slow Drift of Support: Boundary Failures in Multi-Turn Mental Health LLM Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14269)
*Youyou Cheng,Zhuangwei Kang,Kerry Jiang,Chenyu Sun,Qiyang Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current LLM safety evaluations focus on single-turn prohibited words, but multi-turn interactions pose greater risks. This study tests three LLMs with virtual psychiatric dialogues, finding common boundary violations, especially with adaptive probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked gradual erosion of safety boundaries in long dialogues with LLMs, particularly scenarios like definitive guarantees or professional role-playing.

Method: A multi-turn stress testing framework with static progression and adaptive probing was used to test three LLMs across 20-round virtual psychiatric dialogues.

Result: Violations were common, with adaptive probing reducing boundary-crossing turns from 9.21 to 4.64. Definitive promise-making was the primary violation.

Conclusion: Single-turn tests underestimate safety risks; multi-turn interaction pressures must be considered for robust LLM safety evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for mental health support. However, current safety evaluations in this field are mostly limited to detecting whether LLMs output prohibited words in single-turn conversations, neglecting the gradual erosion of safety boundaries in long dialogues. Examples include making definitive guarantees, assuming responsibility, and playing professional roles. We believe that with the evolution of mainstream LLMs, words with obvious safety risks are easily filtered by their underlying systems, while the real danger lies in the gradual transgression of boundaries during multi-turn interactions, driven by the LLM's attempts at comfort and empathy.
  This paper proposes a multi-turn stress testing framework and conducts long-dialogue safety tests on three cutting-edge LLMs using two pressure methods: static progression and adaptive probing. We generated 50 virtual patient profiles and stress-tested each model through up to 20 rounds of virtual psychiatric dialogues. The experimental results show that violations are common, and both pressure modes produced similar violation rates. However, adaptive probing significantly advanced the time at which models crossed boundaries, reducing the average number of turns from 9.21 in static progression to 4.64. Under both mechanisms, making definitive or zero-risk promises was the primary way in which boundaries were breached. These findings suggest that the robustness of LLM safety boundaries cannot be inferred solely through single-turn tests; it is necessary to fully consider the wear and tear on safety boundaries caused by different interaction pressures and characteristics in extended dialogues.

Motivation: Understand how LLMs achieve multi-step reasoning, beyond just performance enhancement.

Method: Organizes insights around seven interconnected research questions, covering implicit and explicit reasoning.

Result: Provides a framework to study LLM reasoning mechanisms and identifies five future research directions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to solve problems requiring multiple reasoning steps, yet the internal mechanisms enabling such capabilities remain elusive. Unlike existing surveys that primarily focus on engineering methods to enhance performance, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying LLM multi-step reasoning. We organize the survey around a conceptual framework comprising seven interconnected research questions, from how LLMs execute implicit multi-hop reasoning within hidden activations to how verbalized explicit reasoning remodels the internal computation. Finally, we highlight five research directions for future mechanistic studies.

TL;DR: Addressing hallucinations in LLM-generated MCQs, a multi-agent framework reduces errors by 90%, ensuring educational quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs undermine MCQ generation quality, necessitating a reliable solution for educational content.

Method: Proposed a multi-agent framework with rule-based and LLM-based detection, hallucination metrics, and iterative refinement using CoT.

Result: Reduced hallucination rates by over 90% in AP-aligned STEM questions while maintaining educational value.

Conclusion: Structured multi-agent collaboration effectively mitigates hallucinations, enhancing reliability in LLM-powered learning tools.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), defined as fluent yet incorrect or incoherent outputs, pose a significant challenge to the automatic generation of educational multiple-choice questions (MCQs). We identified four key hallucination types in MCQ generation: reasoning inconsistencies, insolvability, factual errors, and mathematical errors. To address this, we propose a hallucination-free multi-agent generation framework that breaks down MCQ generation into discrete, verifiable stages. Our framework utilizes both rule-based and LLM-based detection agents, as well as hallucination scoring metrics to optimize question quality. We redefined MCQ generation as an optimization task minimizing hallucination risk while maximizing validity, answerability, and cost-efficiency. We also introduce an agent-led refinement process that uses counterfactual reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) to iteratively improve hallucination in question generation. We evaluated a sample of AP- aligned STEM questions, where our system reduced hallucination rates by over 90% compared to baseline generation while preserving the educational value and style of questions. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent collaboration can mitigate hallucinations in educational content creation at scale, paving the way for more reliable LLM-powered learning tools.

TL;DR: RPC-Bench is a large-scale QA benchmark from computer science review-rebuttal exchanges, evaluating models' precision in scholarly understanding via correctness-completeness and conciseness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack fine-grained evaluation of foundation models' ability to understand specialized scientific discourse and complex content in research papers.

Method: RPC-Bench includes 15K human-verified QA pairs, a fine-grained taxonomy, and an LLM-human annotation framework for scalable labeling. Models are evaluated on correctness-completeness and conciseness using LLM-as-a-Judge.

Result: Top models (e.g., GPT-5) scored 68.2% correctness-completeness, dropping to 37.46% after conciseness adjustment, showing gaps in precise academic understanding.

Conclusion: RPC-Bench highlights significant challenges for models in scholarly comprehension, with room for improvement in precision and conciseness.

Abstract: Understanding research papers remains challenging for foundation models due to specialized scientific discourse and complex figures and tables, yet existing benchmarks offer limited fine-grained evaluation at scale. To address this gap, we introduce RPC-Bench, a large-scale question-answering benchmark built from review-rebuttal exchanges of high-quality computer science papers, containing 15K human-verified QA pairs. We design a fine-grained taxonomy aligned with the scientific research flow to assess models' ability to understand and answer why, what, and how questions in scholarly contexts. We also define an elaborate LLM-human interaction annotation framework to support large-scale labeling and quality control. Following the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, we develop a scalable framework that evaluates models on correctness-completeness and conciseness, with high agreement to human judgment. Experiments reveal that even the strongest models (GPT-5) achieve only 68.2% correctness-completeness, dropping to 37.46% after conciseness adjustment, highlighting substantial gaps in precise academic paper understanding.

TL;DR: Verifier-Guided Distillation trains SLMs to detect and correct errors, improving their reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models (SLMs) often fail on constraint-satisfaction problems due to linear reasoning; this work aims to improve their error-repair capabilities.

Method: Introduces Verifier-Guided Distillation, training SLMs on traces with mistakes and corrections to transfer conflict detection and backtracking.

Result: A 7B model learns latent verification behavior, enabling error detection and self-correction.

Conclusion: SLMs can be trained to exhibit verification and repair behaviors, enhancing their reasoning.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs, under 10B parameters) are attractive for private, on-device deployment, yet they frequently fail on strict constraint-satisfaction problems due to linear, overconfident reasoning traces that do not recover from early mistakes. We introduce Verifier-Guided Distillation, a training protocol that transfers the process of error repair - explicit conflict detection and backtracking - rather than only correct final answers. By training a 7B model on verified reasoning traces that include mistakes and self-corrections, we show that latent verification behavior can emerge in small models, enabling them to occasionally stop, detect contradictions, and revise earlier assumptions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Autoregressive (AR) audio models struggle with complex prompts but implicitly encode global semantics early. Plan-Critic, a lightweight model, evaluates prefixes to guide generation, improving fidelity without extra computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models lack fidelity in following complex textual prompts despite their coherence. The discovery of implicit global semantic encoding in early tokens motivates leveraging this for better planning.

Method: Plan-Critic uses GAE-inspired training to predict final instruction-following quality from partial generations. It prunes low-fidelity trajectories and reallocates computation to high-potential prefixes.

Result: Plan-Critic improves CLAP scores by up to 10 points over AR baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in text-to-audio generation.

Conclusion: The work shows AR models can plan ahead globally, bridging causal generation and semantic alignment, enhancing prompt fidelity without extra cost.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models excel at generating temporally coherent audio by producing tokens sequentially, yet they often falter in faithfully following complex textual prompts, especially those describing complex sound events. We uncover a surprising capability in AR audio generators: their early prefix tokens implicitly encode global semantic attributes of the final output, such as event count and sound-object category, revealing a form of implicit planning. Building on this insight, we propose Plan-Critic, a lightweight auxiliary model trained with a Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)-inspired objective to predict final instruction-following quality from partial generations. At inference time, Plan-Critic enables guided exploration: it evaluates candidate prefixes early, prunes low-fidelity trajectories, and reallocates computation to high-potential planning seeds. Our Plan-Critic-guided sampling achieves up to a 10-point improvement in CLAP score over the AR baseline-establishing a new state of the art in AR text-to-audio generation-while maintaining computational parity with standard best-of-N decoding. This work bridges the gap between causal generation and global semantic alignment, demonstrating that even strictly autoregressive models can plan ahead.

TL;DR: The paper explores accent control in TTS models by analyzing the interaction between speaker embeddings and phonological rules, proposing the PSR metric to measure their interplay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accent control is crucial for flexible TTS models, but current methods using speaker embeddings lack interpretability and controllability.

Method: Analyze speaker embeddings and phonological rules (e.g., flapping, rhoticity) in accented speech, introducing the PSR metric.

Result: Combining rules with embeddings improves accent authenticity, but embeddings can override rules, showing accent-speaker entanglement.

Conclusion: Phonological rules offer better accent control and a framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech synthesis.

Abstract: Many spoken languages, including English, exhibit wide variation in dialects and accents, making accent control an important capability for flexible text-to-speech (TTS) models. Current TTS systems typically generate accented speech by conditioning on speaker embeddings associated with specific accents. While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as embeddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), a novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations. Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity. Our findings highlight rules as a lever for accent control and a framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech generation.

Motivation: To address the lack of methodological guidance and evidence for LLM integration in qualitative analysis, especially in health-services research.

Method: Developed a flexible framework for human-LLM qualitative analysis methods, applied in a diabetes care study for qualitative synthesis and deductive coding of transcripts.

Result: LLM assistance enabled timely practitioner feedback and large-scale qualitative data integration, improving intervention refinement and theory development.

Conclusion: LLMs can enhance qualitative research efficiency and rigor in health-services research, providing a foundation for further innovation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for improving the efficiency of qualitative analysis in large, multi-site health-services research. Yet methodological guidance for LLM integration into qualitative analysis and evidence of their impact on real-world research methods and outcomes remain limited. We developed a model- and task-agnostic framework for designing human-LLM qualitative analysis methods to support diverse analytic aims. Within a multi-site study of diabetes care at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), we leveraged the framework to implement human-LLM methods for (1) qualitative synthesis of researcher-generated summaries to produce comparative feedback reports and (2) deductive coding of 167 interview transcripts to refine a practice-transformation intervention. LLM assistance enabled timely feedback to practitioners and the incorporation of large-scale qualitative data to inform theory and practice changes. This work demonstrates how LLMs can be integrated into applied health-services research to enhance efficiency while preserving rigor, offering guidance for continued innovation with LLMs in qualitative research.

Motivation: Assess LLMs' ability to solve statistical tasks and evaluate reasoning quality, as their performance in complex statistical challenges remains unclear.

Method: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs on a custom dataset, comparing their performance with human benchmarks and evaluating self-assessment capabilities.

Result: Fine-tuned models perform comparably to statistics students and show architecture-dependent improvements; LLMs outperform traditional metrics in evaluating answer quality.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs show promise for educational technology, statistical assistance, and automated quality assessment, with broader applications in research and industry.

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve statistical tasks, as well as their capacity to assess the quality of reasoning. While state-of-the-art LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in a range of NLP tasks, their competence in addressing even moderately complex statistical challenges is not well understood. We have fine-tuned selected open-source LLMs on a specially developed dataset to enhance their statistical reasoning capabilities, and compared their performance with the human scores used as a benchmark. Our results show that the fine-tuned models achieve better performance on advanced statistical tasks on the level comparable to a statistics student. Fine-tuning demonstrates architecture-dependent improvements, with some models showing significant performance gains, indicating clear potential for deployment in educational technology and statistical analysis assistance systems. We also show that LLMs themselves can be far better judges of the answers quality (including explanation and reasoning assessment) in comparison to traditional metrics, such as BLEU or BertScore. This self-evaluation capability enables scalable automated assessment for statistical education platforms and quality assurance in automated analysis tools. Potential applications also include validation tools for research methodology in academic and industry settings, and quality control mechanisms for data analysis workflows.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explains why multi-agent systems (MAS) with large language models outperform single agents by modeling agents as enforcing distinct constraints, leading to invariant solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why MAS with identical information outperform single agents.

Method: Formal modeling using operator theory and constrained optimization; agents enforce distinct constraints on shared solutions.

Result: MAS dynamics converge to invariant solution sets not accessible to single agents.

Conclusion: MAS outperform single agents due to factorized constraint enforcement, even with identical expressive capacity.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of large language models often exhibit improved problem-solving performance despite operating on identical information. In this work, we provide a formal explanation for this phenomenon grounded in operator theory and constrained optimization. We model each agent as enforcing a distinct family of validity constraints on a shared solution state, and show that a MAS implements a factorized composition of constraint-enforcement operators. Under mild conditions, these dynamics converge to invariant solution sets defined by the intersection of agent constraint sets. Such invariant structures are generally not dynamically accessible to a single agent applying all constraints simultaneously, even when expressive capacity and information are identical. We extend this result from exact constraint enforcement to soft constraints via proximal operators, and apply the formalism to contemporary text-based dialog systems.

Motivation: Challenges in evaluating Text-to-SQL agents due to lack of realistic, domain-specific data in BI settings.

Method: Proposes a Business Logic-Driven Data Synthesis framework incorporating business personas, scenarios, workflows, and complexity control.

Result: Achieves 98.44% business realism, outperforming OmniSQL (+19.5%) and SQL-Factory (+54.7%), with 98.59% question-SQL alignment. State-of-the-art models score only 42.86% on complex queries.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generates high-quality synthetic data, highlighting limitations in current Text-to-SQL models for complex business queries.

Abstract: Evaluating Text-to-SQL agents in private business intelligence (BI) settings is challenging due to the scarcity of realistic, domain-specific data. While synthetic evaluation data offers a scalable solution, existing generation methods fail to capture business realism--whether questions reflect realistic business logic and workflows. We propose a Business Logic-Driven Data Synthesis framework that generates data grounded in business personas, work scenarios, and workflows. In addition, we improve the data quality by imposing a business reasoning complexity control strategy that diversifies the analytical reasoning steps required to answer the questions. Experiments on a production-scale Salesforce database show that our synthesized data achieves high business realism (98.44%), substantially outperforming OmniSQL (+19.5%) and SQL-Factory (+54.7%), while maintaining strong question-SQL alignment (98.59%). Our synthetic data also reveals that state-of-the-art Text-to-SQL models still have significant performance gaps, achieving only 42.86% execution accuracy on the most complex business queries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automated AI research leverages LLMs and execution grounding to accelerate discovery, testing ideas via evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Evolutionary search proves efficient, outperforming baselines in post-training and pre-training scenarios. Reinforcement learning struggles with mode collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs often produce plausible but ineffective ideas. Execution grounding is proposed to verify ideas' feasibility and effectiveness, and to explore if LLMs can learn from execution feedback.

Method: Built an automated executor to implement and test ideas via large-scale GPU experiments, applying evolutionary search and reinforcement learning to learn from feedback.

Result: Evolutionary search was sample-efficient, outperforming baselines significantly in post-training (69.4% vs 48.0%) and pre-training (19.7 vs 35.9 minutes). Reinforcement learning improved average rewards but suffered from mode collapse.

Conclusion: Automated execution is feasible and evolutionary search is effective for execution-grounded AI research, but reinforcement learning faces challenges like mode collapse. Future work should analyze executed ideas and dynamics further.

Abstract: Automated AI research holds great potential to accelerate scientific discovery. However, current LLMs often generate plausible-looking but ineffective ideas. Execution grounding may help, but it is unclear whether automated execution is feasible and whether LLMs can learn from the execution feedback. To investigate these, we first build an automated executor to implement ideas and launch large-scale parallel GPU experiments to verify their effectiveness. We then convert two realistic research problems - LLM pre-training and post-training - into execution environments and demonstrate that our automated executor can implement a large fraction of the ideas sampled from frontier LLMs. We analyze two methods to learn from the execution feedback: evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Execution-guided evolutionary search is sample-efficient: it finds a method that significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline (69.4% vs 48.0%) on post-training, and finds a pre-training recipe that outperforms the nanoGPT baseline (19.7 minutes vs 35.9 minutes) on pre-training, all within just ten search epochs. Frontier LLMs often generate meaningful algorithmic ideas during search, but they tend to saturate early and only occasionally exhibit scaling trends. Reinforcement learning from execution reward, on the other hand, suffers from mode collapse. It successfully improves the average reward of the ideator model but not the upper-bound, due to models converging on simple ideas. We thoroughly analyze the executed ideas and training dynamics to facilitate future efforts towards execution-grounded automated AI research.

### [93] [Self-Blinding and Counterfactual Self-Simulation Mitigate Biases and Sycophancy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14553)
*Brian Christian,Matan Mazor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to counterfactually offset biases like humans but can improve fairness using their own API.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of making fair decisions by ignoring biasing information, which humans and LLMs both struggle with.

Method: Prompting LLMs to ignore biases and using their own API for counterfactual self-simulation.

Result: Prompting fails to offset biases, but API access enables fairer decisions and transparency.

Conclusion: LLMs can leverage their API to improve fairness in decision-making and distinguish implicit biases.

Abstract: Fair decisions require ignoring irrelevant, potentially biasing, information. To achieve this, decision-makers need to approximate what decision they would have made had they not known certain facts, such as the gender or race of a job candidate. This counterfactual self-simulation is notoriously hard for humans, leading to biased judgments even by well-meaning actors. Here we show that large language models (LLMs) suffer from similar limitations in their ability to approximate what decisions they would make under counterfactual knowledge in offsetting gender and race biases and overcoming sycophancy. We show that prompting models to ignore or pretend not to know biasing information fails to offset these biases and occasionally backfires. However, unlike humans, LLMs can be given access to a ground-truth model of their own counterfactual cognition -- their own API. We show that this access to the responses of a blinded replica enables fairer decisions, while providing greater transparency to distinguish implicit from intentionally biased behavior.

TL;DR: PedagogicalRL-Thinking optimizes LLM tutors by improving internal reasoning using educational theory and rewards, showing better performance and structured reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods optimize LLM tutors for visible responses but neglect internal reasoning, limiting their pedagogical effectiveness.

Method: Introduces Pedagogical Reasoning Prompting and Thinking Reward to align LLMs' reasoning with educational theory and reinforce pedagogical quality.

Result: Domain-specific prompting outperforms generic prompting, and Thinking Reward enhances reasoning traces, improving performance on unseen educational benchmarks.

Conclusion: PedagogicalRL-Thinking improves LLM tutors' internal reasoning and instructional quality, benefiting educational applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent tutoring systems, yet research on optimizing LLMs specifically for educational contexts remains limited. Recent works have proposed reinforcement learning approaches for training LLM tutors, but these methods focus solely on optimizing visible responses while neglecting the model's internal thinking process. We introduce PedagogicalRL-Thinking, a framework that extends pedagogical alignment to reasoning LLMs in education through two novel approaches: (1) Pedagogical Reasoning Prompting, which guides internal reasoning using domain-specific educational theory rather than generic instructions; and (2) Thinking Reward, which explicitly evaluates and reinforces the pedagogical quality of the model's reasoning traces. Our experiments reveal that domain-specific, theory-grounded prompting outperforms generic prompting, and that Thinking Reward is most effective when combined with pedagogical prompting. Furthermore, models trained only on mathematics tutoring dialogues show improved performance on educational benchmarks not seen during training, while preserving the base model's factual knowledge. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that pedagogical thinking reward produces systematic reasoning trace changes, with increased pedagogical reasoning and more structured instructional decision-making in the tutor's thinking process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing MLLMs' ability to interpret human social interactions is crucial for advancing multimodal AI.

Method: Social Caption framework evaluates MLLMs along SI, HSA, and DSA dimensions, studying factors like scale and context.

Result: Experiments provide insights into scaling automated evaluation for multimodal social understanding.

Conclusion: Social Caption advances evaluation methods for MLLMs' social understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Social understanding abilities are crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interpret human social interactions. We introduce Social Caption, a framework grounded in interaction theory to evaluate social understanding abilities of MLLMs along three dimensions: Social Inference (SI), the ability to make accurate inferences about interactions; Holistic Social Analysis (HSA), the ability to generate comprehensive descriptions of interactions; Directed Social Analysis (DSA), the ability to extract relevant social information from interactions. We analyze factors influencing model performance in social understanding, such as scale, architectural design, and spoken context. Experiments with MLLM judges contribute insights about scaling automated evaluation of multimodal social understanding.

*Xichen Zhang,Ziyi He,Yinghao Zhu,Sitong Wu,Shaozuo Yu,Meng Chu,Wenhu Zhang,Haoru Tan,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SearchGym is a simulation environment designed to train robust search agents by addressing noise and misalignment issues in static data, using a curriculum learning approach called SearchGym-RL. It shows strong generalization and outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training search agents via RL is costly with live APIs or noisy with static data, leading to corrupted rewards. SearchGym aims to solve this by providing a controlled, verifiable environment.

Method: SearchGym uses a generative pipeline to create a knowledge graph and aligned document corpus. SearchGym-RL employs curriculum learning to progressively train agents with purified feedback.

Result: Experiments show strong Sim-to-Real generalization, with the Qwen2.5-7B-Base model outperforming ASearcher by 10.6% on average across nine benchmarks.

Conclusion: High-fidelity simulation is scalable and cost-effective for developing capable search agents, as validated by SearchGym's performance.

Abstract: Search agents have emerged as a pivotal paradigm for solving open-ended, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, training these agents via Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces a critical dilemma: interacting with live commercial Web APIs is prohibitively expensive, while relying on static data snapshots often introduces noise due to data misalignment. This misalignment generates corrupted reward signals that destabilize training by penalizing correct reasoning or rewarding hallucination. To address this, we propose SearchGym, a simulation environment designed to bootstrap robust search agents. SearchGym employs a rigorous generative pipeline to construct a verifiable knowledge graph and an aligned document corpus, ensuring that every reasoning task is factually grounded and strictly solvable. Building on this controllable environment, we introduce SearchGym-RL, a curriculum learning methodology that progressively optimizes agent policies through purified feedback, evolving from basic interactions to complex, long-horizon planning. Extensive experiments across the Llama and Qwen families demonstrate strong Sim-to-Real generalization. Notably, our Qwen2.5-7B-Base model trained within SearchGym surpasses the web-enhanced ASearcher baseline across nine diverse benchmarks by an average relative margin of 10.6%. Our results validate that high-fidelity simulation serves as a scalable and highly cost-effective methodology for developing capable search agents.

### [97] [Say Anything but This: When Tokenizer Betrays Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14658)
*Navid Ayoobi,Marcus I Armstrong,Arjun Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights how non-unique token ID sequences in LLMs can lead to reasoning failures due to tokenizer-detokenizer mismatches, introducing a probe to measure these issues and identifying systematic tokenizer artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and analyze how tokenization inconsistencies in LLMs can undermine reasoning, despite semantically identical text representations.

Method: A tokenization-consistency probe tests LLMs' ability to replace target words accurately, isolating tokenizer artifacts as the source of failures.

Result: Analysis reveals non-trivial rates of phantom edits and identifies eight systematic tokenizer artifacts causing reasoning illusions.

Conclusion: Tokenizer-level remedies are needed to address reasoning deficiencies before scaling up model training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) reason over discrete token ID sequences, yet modern subword tokenizers routinely produce non-unique encodings: multiple token ID sequences can detokenize to identical surface strings. This representational mismatch creates an unmeasured fragility wherein reasoning processes can fail. LLMs may treat two internal representations as distinct "words" even when they are semantically identical at the text level. In this work, we show that tokenization can betray LLM reasoning through one-to-many token ID mappings. We introduce a tokenization-consistency probe that requires models to replace designated target words in context while leaving all other content unchanged. The task is intentionally simple at the surface level, enabling us to attribute failures to tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts rather than to knowledge gaps or parameter limitations. Through analysis of over 11000 replacement trials across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, we find a non-trivial rate of outputs exhibit phantom edits: cases where models operate under the illusion of correct reasoning, a phenomenon arising from tokenizer-induced representational defects. We further analyze these cases and provide a taxonomy of eight systematic tokenizer artifacts, including whitespace-boundary shifts and intra-word resegmentation. These findings indicate that part of apparent reasoning deficiency originates in the tokenizer layer, motivating tokenizer-level remedies before incurring the cost of training ever-larger models on ever-larger corpora.

### [98] [AdaTIR: Adaptive Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14696)
*Zhaiyu Fang,Ruipeng Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaTIR reduces redundant tool calls by adapting tool use to task complexity, enhancing efficiency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agents often offload cognition excessively, invoking tools unnecessarily for simple tasks. True intelligence requires adaptive tool use.

Method: AdaTIR introduces difficulty-aware reasoning internalization and Clipped Advantage Shaping (CAS) to optimize tool use based on task complexity.

Result: AdaTIR cuts tool calls by 97.6% on simple tasks and 28.2% on complex ones, improving accuracy and internalizing reasoning.

Conclusion: AdaTIR successfully shifts the paradigm from static tool invocation to adaptive reasoning, outperforming baselines even without tool access.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current agents tend to exhibit cognitive offloading, redundantly invoking external tools even for simple tasks. In this paper, we suggest that true agentic intelligence requires not just tool invocation, but the adaptive wisdom to discern when to use them. We propose AdaTIR, a framework that shifts the paradigm from static tool invocation to difficulty-aware reasoning internalization. By introducing a difficulty-aware efficiency reward, AdaTIR dynamically adjusts tool budgets based on task complexity--internalizing reasoning for simple tasks while selectively invoking tools for complex tasks. Furthermore, we identify a sign reversal problem where tool penalties outweigh correctness rewards, mistakenly penalizing correct rollouts with negative advantages. To resolve this, we propose Clipped Advantage Shaping (CAS), which ensures that correctness remains the primary objective while using efficiency as a secondary constraint. Empirical results demonstrate that AdaTIR reduces tool calls by up to 97.6% on simple tasks and 28.2% on complex challenges while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. Notably, AdaTIR successfully internalizes reasoning, outperforming baselines by 4.8% on AIME 2024 even when tool access is strictly disabled.

TL;DR: ClaimDB introduces the first fact-verification benchmark using large-scale structured data, revealing limitations in current LLMs' reasoning and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in fact-verification benchmarks for claims derived from large-scale structured data, which current models struggle with.

Method: Created ClaimDB, a benchmark with 80 real-life databases across various domains, requiring reasoning over compositions of millions of records and multiple tables.

Result: Experiments with 30 state-of-the-art LLMs show none exceed 83% accuracy, with over half below 55%. Models also struggle with abstention.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack reliability in high-stakes data analysis due to poor performance on reasoning tasks and abstention in ClaimDB.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in fact-verification benchmarks, claims grounded in large-scale structured data remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce ClaimDB, the first fact-verification benchmark where the evidence for claims is derived from compositions of millions of records and multiple tables. ClaimDB consists of 80 unique real-life databases covering a wide range of domains, from governance and healthcare to media, education and the natural sciences. At this scale, verification approaches that rely on "reading" the evidence break down, forcing a timely shift toward reasoning in executable programs. We conduct extensive experiments with 30 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source (below 70B) LLMs and find that none exceed 83% accuracy, with more than half below 55%. Our analysis also reveals that both closed- and open-source models struggle with abstention -- the ability to admit that there is no evidence to decide -- raising doubts about their reliability in high-stakes data analysis. We release the benchmark, code, and the LLM leaderboard at https://claimdb.github.io .

### [100] [DARL: Encouraging Diverse Answers for General Reasoning without Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14700)
*Chongxuan Huang,Lei Lin,Xiaodong Shi,Wenping Hu,Ruiming Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARL, a new reinforcement learning framework, improves reasoning and diversity in LLMs by encouraging controlled deviation from references without needing extra verifiers. It outperforms RLPR on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like RLVR and RLPR limit output diversity and overfit to references, especially in open-ended tasks. DARL aims to address this by promoting diverse yet aligned outputs.

Method: DARL uses reinforcement learning to generate diverse answers within a controlled range of deviation from reference answers, integrating seamlessly with existing methods.

Result: DARL outperforms RLPR, achieving gains of 1.3 points on reasoning benchmarks and 9.5 points on general benchmarks.

Conclusion: DARL effectively balances diversity and alignment, enhancing LLM performance without requiring additional verifiers.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated promising gains in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, its dependence on domain-specific verifiers significantly restricts its applicability to open and general domains. Recent efforts such as RLPR have extended RLVR to general domains, enabling training on broader datasets and achieving improvements over RLVR. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their tendency to overfit to reference answers, which constrains the model's ability to generate diverse outputs. This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-ended tasks such as writing, where multiple plausible answers exist. To address this, we propose DARL, a simple yet effective reinforcement learning framework that encourages the generation of diverse answers within a controlled deviation range from the reference while preserving alignment with it. Our framework is fully compatible with existing general reinforcement learning methods and can be seamlessly integrated without additional verifiers. Extensive experiments on thirteen benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in reasoning performance. Notably, DARL surpasses RLPR, achieving average gains of 1.3 points on six reasoning benchmarks and 9.5 points on seven general benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving both reasoning accuracy and output diversity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Typhoon OCR is an open vision-language model tailored for Thai and English document extraction, addressing challenges like script complexity and unstructured documents. It achieves performance comparable to proprietary models with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models favor high-resource languages and struggle with Thai's script complexity, lack of word boundaries, and unstructured documents.

Method: Fine-tuned from vision-language backbones using a Thai-focused dataset created via a multi-stage pipeline combining OCR, VLM-based restructuring, and synthetic data.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show Typhoon OCR performs comparably to or better than larger proprietary models across diverse Thai document types.

Conclusion: Typhoon OCR proves open VLMs can achieve accurate Thai document extraction and layout reconstruction while remaining lightweight and deployable.

Abstract: Document extraction is a core component of digital workflows, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) predominantly favor high-resource languages. Thai presents additional challenges due to script complexity from non-latin letters, the absence of explicit word boundaries, and the prevalence of highly unstructured real-world documents, limiting the effectiveness of current open-source models. This paper presents Typhoon OCR, an open VLM for document extraction tailored for Thai and English. The model is fine-tuned from vision-language backbones using a Thai-focused training dataset. The dataset is developed using a multi-stage data construction pipeline that combines traditional OCR, VLM-based restructuring, and curated synthetic data. Typhoon OCR is a unified framework capable of text transcription, layout reconstruction, and document-level structural consistency. The latest iteration of our model, Typhoon OCR V1.5, is a compact and inference-efficient model designed to reduce reliance on metadata and simplify deployment. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse Thai document categories, including financial reports, government forms, books, infographics, and handwritten documents, show that Typhoon OCR achieves performance comparable to or exceeding larger frontier proprietary models, despite substantially lower computational cost. The results demonstrate that open vision-language OCR models can achieve accurate text extraction and layout reconstruction for Thai documents, reaching performance comparable to proprietary systems while remaining lightweight and deployable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Render-of-Thought (RoT) reifies reasoning chains into images for efficiency and traceability, achieving token compression and competitive performance compared to Chain-of-Thought prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational overhead and lack of supervision in intermediate reasoning steps inherent in Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Method: Renders textual reasoning steps into images using vision encoders of Vision Language Models to align embeddings with textual space.

Result: Achieves 3-4x token compression, inference acceleration, and maintains competitive performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: RoT validates the feasibility of visualizing reasoning chains for efficiency and traceability.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in unlocking the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT. Furthermore, it maintains competitive performance against other methods, validating the feasibility of this paradigm. Our code is available at https://github.com/TencentBAC/RoT

TL;DR: The paper introduces PsyFIRE and RECAP, frameworks for detecting fine-grained resistance behaviors in text-based mental health counseling, outperforming existing methods and improving counselor interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLP methods for detecting client resistance in text-based counseling are oversimplified and lack interpretability. The study aims to address these gaps by providing a nuanced and explainable framework.

Method: Proposes PsyFIRE, a framework for categorizing 13 resistance behaviors, and constructs the ClientResistance corpus. RECAP, a two-stage framework, detects resistance and its types with explanations using this dataset.

Result: RECAP achieves 91.25% F1 for collaboration vs. resistance and 66.58% macro-F1 for fine-grained resistance classification, surpassing prompt-based LLM baselines by over 20 points. It also reveals resistance prevalence and its negative impact.

Conclusion: RECAP demonstrates effectiveness in detecting resistance and improving counselors' understanding and intervention strategies in text-based counseling, highlighting its practical utility.

Abstract: Recognizing and navigating client resistance is critical for effective mental health counseling, yet detecting such behaviors is particularly challenging in text-based interactions. Existing NLP approaches oversimplify resistance categories, ignore the sequential dynamics of therapeutic interventions, and offer limited interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we propose PsyFIRE, a theoretically grounded framework capturing 13 fine-grained resistance behaviors alongside collaborative interactions. Based on PsyFIRE, we construct the ClientResistance corpus with 23,930 annotated utterances from real-world Chinese text-based counseling, each supported by context-specific rationales. Leveraging this dataset, we develop RECAP, a two-stage framework that detects resistance and fine-grained resistance types with explanations.
  RECAP achieves 91.25% F1 for distinguishing collaboration and resistance and 66.58% macro-F1 for fine-grained resistance categories classification, outperforming leading prompt-based LLM baselines by over 20 points. Applied to a separate counseling dataset and a pilot study with 62 counselors, RECAP reveals the prevalence of resistance, its negative impact on therapeutic relationships and demonstrates its potential to improve counselors' understanding and intervention strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates GPT-5.2 and Qwen-Max-Latest on Chinese film script continuations, revealing GPT-5.2's superiority in structural preservation, quality, and consistency, while Qwen-Max-Latest has higher ROUGE-L scores but struggles with stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess LLMs' performance on culturally specific creative writing tasks, specifically Chinese film script continuations.

Method: Constructed a benchmark with 53 classic films, used a 'first half to second half' continuation paradigm, and evaluated models using ROUGE-L, Structural Similarity, and LLM-as-Judge scoring.

Result: GPT-5.2 outperformed Qwen-Max-Latest in structural preservation (0.93 vs 0.75), overall quality (44.79 vs 25.72), and composite scores (0.50 vs 0.39), while Qwen-Max-Latest had higher ROUGE-L scores (0.2230 vs 0.2114).

Conclusion: GPT-5.2 is better suited for Chinese creative writing tasks due to its superior structural and qualitative performance, whereas Qwen-Max-Latest lacks stability. The study offers a reproducible evaluation framework.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative writing, their performance on culturally specific narrative tasks warrants systematic investigation. This study constructs the first Chinese film script continuation benchmark comprising 53 classic films, and designs a multi-dimensional evaluation framework comparing GPT-5.2 and Qwen-Max-Latest. Using a "first half to second half" continuation paradigm with 3 samples per film, we obtained 303 valid samples (GPT-5.2: 157, 98.7% validity; Qwen-Max: 146, 91.8% validity). Evaluation integrates ROUGE-L, Structural Similarity, and LLM-as-Judge scoring (DeepSeek-Reasoner).
  Statistical analysis of 144 paired samples reveals: Qwen-Max achieves marginally higher ROUGE-L (0.2230 vs 0.2114, d=-0.43); however, GPT-5.2 significantly outperforms in structural preservation (0.93 vs 0.75, d=0.46), overall quality (44.79 vs 25.72, d=1.04), and composite scores (0.50 vs 0.39, d=0.84). The overall quality effect size reaches large effect level (d>0.8).
  GPT-5.2 excels in character consistency, tone-style matching, and format preservation, while Qwen-Max shows deficiencies in generation stability. This study provides a reproducible framework for LLM evaluation in Chinese creative writing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiNS improves memory retrieval in language agents by addressing hierarchical difficulty of negative samples and their natural distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training data for memory-augmented language agents lacks nuanced negative sample difficulty tiers and realistic distribution.

Method: Proposes HiNS, a framework modeling negative sample difficulty tiers and incorporating empirical ratios from conversational data.

Result: Significant improvements: LoCoMo (F1/BLEU-1 gains up to 3.30%) and PERSONAMEM (total score improvements up to 2.55%).

Conclusion: HiNS enhances embedding models for robust memory retrieval by better reflecting real-world negative sample diversity.

Abstract: Memory-augmented language agents rely on embedding models for effective memory retrieval. However, existing training data construction overlooks a critical limitation: the hierarchical difficulty of negative samples and their natural distribution in human-agent interactions. In practice, some negatives are semantically close distractors while others are trivially irrelevant, and natural dialogue exhibits structured proportions of these types. Current approaches using synthetic or uniformly sampled negatives fail to reflect this diversity, limiting embedding models' ability to learn nuanced discrimination essential for robust memory retrieval. In this work, we propose a principled data construction framework HiNS that explicitly models negative sample difficulty tiers and incorporates empirically grounded negative ratios derived from conversational data, enabling the training of embedding models with substantially improved retrieval fidelity and generalization in memory-intensive tasks. Experiments show significant improvements: on LoCoMo, F1/BLEU-1 gains of 3.27%/3.30%(MemoryOS) and 1.95%/1.78% (Mem0); on PERSONAMEM, total score improvements of 1.19% (MemoryOS) and 2.55% (Mem0).

TL;DR: LcRL is a multilingual search-augmented RL framework addressing knowledge bias and conflict in MRAG by integrating language-coupled group sampling and anti-consistency regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRAG models use a uniform process for multilingual queries, leading to suboptimal performance due to knowledge bias and conflict during retrieval. LcRL aims to mitigate these issues.

Method: Proposes LcRL, integrating language-coupled Group Relative Policy Optimization, group sampling in rollout to reduce bias, and anti-consistency penalty in rewards to address conflict.

Result: LcRL achieves competitive performance and suits practical scenarios like constrained data and large multilingual collections.

Conclusion: LcRL effectively reduces knowledge bias and conflict in multilingual retrieval-augmented generation, demonstrating versatility and strong performance.

Abstract: Multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (MRAG) requires models to effectively acquire and integrate beneficial external knowledge from multilingual collections. However, most existing studies employ a unitive process where queries of equivalent semantics across different languages are processed through a single-turn retrieval and subsequent optimization. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy is often suboptimal in multilingual settings, as the models occur to knowledge bias and conflict during the interaction with the search engine. To alleviate the issues, we propose LcRL, a multilingual search-augmented reinforcement learning framework that integrates a language-coupled Group Relative Policy Optimization into the policy and reward models. We adopt the language-coupled group sampling in the rollout module to reduce knowledge bias, and regularize an auxiliary anti-consistency penalty in the reward models to mitigate the knowledge conflict. Experimental results demonstrate that LcRL not only achieves competitive performance but is also appropriate for various practical scenarios such as constrained training data and retrieval over collections encompassing a large number of languages.

Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation resources for podcast script generation tasks involving structured, context-grounded dialogue synthesis.

Method: Introduces PodBench with 800 samples and proposes a multifaceted evaluation framework combining quantitative constraints with LLM-based quality assessment.

Result: Proprietary models generally excel, but open-source models with explicit reasoning show superior robustness in long contexts and multi-speaker coordination. High instruction following doesn't always ensure high content substance.

Conclusion: PodBench provides a reproducible testbed to tackle challenges in long-form, audio-centric generation, highlighting gaps between instruction adherence and content quality.

Abstract: Podcast script generation requires LLMs to synthesize structured, context-grounded dialogue from diverse inputs, yet systematic evaluation resources for this task remain limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce PodBench, a benchmark comprising 800 samples with inputs up to 21K tokens and complex multi-speaker instructions. We propose a multifaceted evaluation framework that integrates quantitative constraints with LLM-based quality assessment. Extensive experiments reveal that while proprietary models generally excel, open-source models equipped with explicit reasoning demonstrate superior robustness in handling long contexts and multi-speaker coordination compared to standard baselines. However, our analysis uncovers a persistent divergence where high instruction following does not guarantee high content substance. PodBench offers a reproducible testbed to address these challenges in long-form, audio-centric generation.

Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with context pollution when handling both planning and execution, impairing long-term task performance.

Method: Proposes CodeDelegator, using role specialization (Delegator for planning, Coders for execution) and Ephemeral-Persistent State Separation (EPSS) to maintain coherence.

Result: Experiments show CodeDelegator's effectiveness across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Separating planning and implementation improves performance by preventing context pollution.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) allow agents to represent actions as executable code, offering greater expressivity than traditional tool-calling. However, real-world tasks often demand both strategic planning and detailed implementation. Using a single agent for both leads to context pollution from debugging traces and intermediate failures, impairing long-horizon performance. We propose CodeDelegator, a multi-agent framework that separates planning from implementation via role specialization. A persistent Delegator maintains strategic oversight by decomposing tasks, writing specifications, and monitoring progress without executing code. For each sub-task, a new Coder agent is instantiated with a clean context containing only its specification, shielding it from prior failures. To coordinate between agents, we introduce Ephemeral-Persistent State Separation (EPSS), which isolates each Coder's execution state while preserving global coherence, preventing debugging traces from polluting the Delegator's context. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeDelegator across diverse scenarios.

### [109] [The GDN-CC Dataset: Automatic Corpus Clarification for AI-enhanced Democratic Citizen Consultations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14944)
*Pierre-Antoine Lequeu,Léo Labat,Laurène Cave,Gaël Lejeune,François Yvon,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses ethical concerns of using LLMs for democratic text analysis by developing Corpus Clarification, a preprocessing framework, and testing small LLMs' performance on standardization and topic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To standardize citizen contributions for easier analysis and assess small LLMs' reliability in this task, addressing ethical concerns with large LLMs.

Method: Introduces Corpus Clarification for preprocessing consultation data and tests small LLMs on annotation and clustering tasks using GDN-CC dataset.

Result: Small LLMs match or outperform larger LLMs in annotation tasks; GDN-CC-large, a 240k annotated corpus, is released.

Conclusion: Small, open-weights LLMs are viable for democratic text standardization, offering transparency and efficiency.

Abstract: LLMs are ubiquitous in modern NLP, and while their applicability extends to texts produced for democratic activities such as online deliberations or large-scale citizen consultations, ethical questions have been raised for their usage as analysis tools. We continue this line of research with two main goals: (a) to develop resources that can help standardize citizen contributions in public forums at the pragmatic level, and make them easier to use in topic modeling and political analysis; (b) to study how well this standardization can reliably be performed by small, open-weights LLMs, i.e. models that can be run locally and transparently with limited resources. Accordingly, we introduce Corpus Clarification as a preprocessing framework for large-scale consultation data that transforms noisy, multi-topic contributions into structured, self-contained argumentative units ready for downstream analysis. We present GDN-CC, a manually-curated dataset of 1,231 contributions to the French Grand Débat National, comprising 2,285 argumentative units annotated for argumentative structure and manually clarified. We then show that finetuned Small Language Models match or outperform LLMs on reproducing these annotations, and measure their usability for an opinion clustering task. We finally release GDN-CC-large, an automatically annotated corpus of 240k contributions, the largest annotated democratic consultation dataset to date.

### [110] [CorpusQA: A 10 Million Token Benchmark for Corpus-Level Analysis and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14952)
*Zhiyuan Lu,Chenliang Li,Yingcheng Shi,Weizhou Shen,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CorpusQA, a benchmark for evaluating reasoning across large document repositories, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by scaling up to 10 million tokens and ensuring ground-truth answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are inadequate for corpus-level reasoning as they assume answers can be derived from sparse retrieval, failing to address dispersed evidence and global integration.

Method: A novel data synthesis framework decouples reasoning from textual representation, creating complex queries with guaranteed answers and evaluating holistic reasoning over unstructured text.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with increasing input length, and retrieval-augmented systems collapse, highlighting the need for advanced architectures.

Conclusion: Memory-augmented agentic architectures are proposed as a robust alternative, suggesting a shift from extending context windows to global information synthesis.

Abstract: While large language models now handle million-token contexts, their capacity for reasoning across entire document repositories remains largely untested. Existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they are mostly limited to single long texts or rely on a "sparse retrieval" assumption-that answers can be derived from a few relevant chunks. This assumption fails for true corpus-level analysis, where evidence is highly dispersed across hundreds of documents and answers require global integration, comparison, and statistical aggregation. To address this critical gap, we introduce CorpusQA, a new benchmark scaling up to 10 million tokens, generated via a novel data synthesis framework. By decoupling reasoning from textual representation, this framework creates complex, computation-intensive queries with programmatically guaranteed ground-truth answers, challenging systems to perform holistic reasoning over vast, unstructured text without relying on fallible human annotation. We further demonstrate the utility of our framework beyond evaluation, showing that fine-tuning on our synthesized data effectively enhances an LLM's general long-context reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art long-context LLMs struggle as input length increases, and standard retrieval-augmented generation systems collapse entirely. Our findings indicate that memory-augmented agentic architectures offer a more robust alternative, suggesting a critical shift is needed from simply extending context windows to developing advanced architectures for global information synthesis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark of modern Language Models (LMs) on Sinhala scripts reveals Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407 and Mistral-7B-v0.3 excel in Unicode and Romanized Sinhala, respectively, while Llama-3.1-8B performs well across both. Closed-source models like Gemini-1.5-pro and Claude-3.5-Sonnet show script-specific strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LM performance on lower-resource, morphologically rich languages like Sinhala, especially Romanized Sinhala, which is widely used digitally.

Method: Evaluated open-source models using perplexity for predictive performance and analyzed closed-source models qualitatively via sentence completion.

Result: Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407 excels in Unicode Sinhala; Mistral-7B-v0.3 performs best for Romanized text. Llama-3.1-8B shows strong performance across both scripts. Closed-source models vary significantly in script handling.

Conclusion: The study provides a guide for selecting LMs for Sinhala applications and emphasizes training data's role in handling script variations.

Abstract: The performance of Language Models (LMs) on lower-resource, morphologically rich languages like Sinhala remains under-explored, particularly for Romanized Sinhala, which is prevalent in digital communication. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of modern LMs on a diverse corpus of Unicode and Romanized Sinhala. We evaluate open-source models using perplexity, a measure of how well a model predicts a text, and leading closed-source models via a qualitative analysis of sentence completion. Our findings reveal that the Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407 model achieves the strongest predictive performance on Unicode text and the Mistral-7B-v0.3 model for Romanized text. The results also highlight the strong all-around performance of the Llama-3.1-8B model for both scripts. Furthermore, a significant performance disparity exists among closed-source models: Gemini-1.5-pro and DeepSeek excel at Unicode generation, whereas Claude-3.5-Sonnet is superior at handling Romanized text. These results provide an essential guide for practitioners selecting models for Sinhala-specific applications and highlight the critical role of training data in handling script variations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores multilingual data contamination in LLMs, extending detection methods to Arabic and proposing a translation-aware approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding multilingual contamination, as prior methods were limited to English benchmarks.

Method: Fine-tuned LLMs on Arabic datasets and evaluated on English benchmarks, using extended Tested Slot Guessing and Min-K% probability analysis.

Result: Contamination indicators were suppressed in Arabic, but models still benefited, shown by rising Min-K% scores and cross-lingual consistency.

Conclusion: Multilingual, translation-aware evaluation pipelines are needed for fair and transparent LLM assessment.

Abstract: Data contamination undermines the validity of Large Language Model evaluation by enabling models to rely on memorized benchmark content rather than true generalization. While prior work has proposed contamination detection methods, these approaches are largely limited to English benchmarks, leaving multilingual contamination poorly understood. In this work, we investigate contamination dynamics in multilingual settings by fine-tuning several open-weight LLMs on varying proportions of Arabic datasets and evaluating them on original English benchmarks. To detect memorization, we extend the Tested Slot Guessing method with a choice-reordering strategy and incorporate Min-K% probability analysis, capturing both behavioral and distributional contamination signals.
  Our results show that translation into Arabic suppresses conventional contamination indicators, yet models still benefit from exposure to contaminated data, particularly those with stronger Arabic capabilities. This effect is consistently reflected in rising Mink% scores and increased cross-lingual answer consistency as contamination levels grow. To address this blind spot, we propose Translation-Aware Contamination Detection, which identifies contamination by comparing signals across multiple translated benchmark variants rather than English alone. The Translation-Aware Contamination Detection reliably exposes contamination even when English-only methods fail. Together, our findings highlight the need for multilingual, translation-aware evaluation pipelines to ensure fair, transparent, and reproducible assessment of LLMs.

*Xiaonan Jing,Gongqing Wu,Xingrui Zhuo,Lang Sun,Jiapu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KRPO, a framework for improving ORTE tasks using LLMs by optimizing prompts dynamically and addressing semantic ambiguity and relation redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ORTE methods rely on static prompting strategies, leading to errors in semantic ambiguity and permanent extraction patterns.

Method: Proposes KRPO with self-evaluation via knowledge restoration, textual gradient-based prompt optimization, and relation canonicalization memory.

Result: KRPO outperforms baselines significantly in extraction F1 scores across three datasets.

Conclusion: KRPO effectively enhances LLMs' ORTE capabilities by addressing prompt optimization and relation redundancy.

Abstract: Open-domain Relational Triplet Extraction (ORTE) is the foundation for mining structured knowledge without predefined schemas. Despite the impressive in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing methods are hindered by their reliance on static, heuristic-driven prompting strategies. Due to the lack of reflection mechanisms required to internalize erroneous signals, these methods exhibit vulnerability in semantic ambiguity, often making erroneous extraction patterns permanent. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Knowledge Reconstruction-driven Prompt Optimization (KRPO) framework to assist LLMs in continuously improving their extraction capabilities for complex ORTE task flows. Specifically, we design a self-evaluation mechanism based on knowledge restoration, which provides intrinsic feedback signals by projecting structured triplets into semantic consistency scores. Subsequently, we propose a prompt optimizer based on a textual gradient that can internalize historical experiences to iteratively optimize prompts, which can better guide LLMs to handle subsequent extraction tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate relation redundancy, we design a relation canonicalization memory that collects representative relations and provides semantically distinct schemas for the triplets. Extensive experiments across three datasets show that KRPO significantly outperforms strong baselines in the extraction F1 score.

### [114] [\textsc{LogicScore}: Fine-grained Logic Evaluation of Conciseness, Completeness, and Determinateness in Attributed Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15050)
*Zhichao Yan,Yunxiao Zhao,Jiapu Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Shaoru Guo,Xiaoli Li,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogicScore is a new evaluation framework for Attributed Question Answering (AQA) that addresses logical coherence gaps overlooked by current methods. It assesses Completeness, Conciseness, and Determinateness, revealing significant reasoning deficiencies in top LLMs despite high attribution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AQA evaluations focus too narrowly on isolated statement verification, ignoring global logical integrity, leading LLMs to produce factually accurate but logically flawed answers.

Method: LogicScore introduces Horn Rules-based backward verification to systematically evaluate Completeness, Conciseness, and Determinateness in reasoning.

Result: Tests on three datasets (HotpotQA, MusiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA) and 20+ LLMs show high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85% precision for Gemini-3 Pro) but poor global reasoning (e.g., 35.11% Conciseness).

Conclusion: LogicScore highlights the need for prioritizing logical coherence alongside factual grounding in LLM development, setting a new evaluation standard.

Abstract: Current evaluation methods for Attributed Question Answering (AQA) suffer from \textit{attribution myopia}: they emphasize verification of isolated statements and their attributions but overlook the global logical integrity of long-form answers. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce factually grounded yet logically incoherent responses with elusive deductive gaps. To mitigate this limitation, we present \textsc{LogicScore}, a unified evaluation framework that shifts the paradigm from local assessment to global reasoning scrutiny. Grounded in Horn Rules, our approach integrates a backward verification mechanism to systematically evaluate three key reasoning dimensions: \textit{Completeness} (logically sound deduction), \textit{Conciseness} (non-redundancy), and \textit{Determinateness} (consistent answer entailment). Extensive experiments across three multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, MusiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) and over 20 LLMs (including GPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, LLaMA3, and task-specific tuned models) reveal a critical capability gap: leading models often achieve high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85\% precision for Gemini-3 Pro) but struggle with global reasoning quality (e.g., 35.11\% Conciseness for Gemini-3 Pro). Our work establishes a robust standard for logical evaluation, highlighting the need to prioritize reasoning coherence alongside factual grounding in LLM development.

*Vuong Hung Truong,Mariana Gabrielle Cangco Reyes,Masatoshi Koizumi,Jihwan Myung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reveals circadian rhythms in semantic behavior using Reddit data, showing distinct patterns of linguistic exploration-exploitation throughout the day, independent of mood.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how human cognition's circadian modulation influences high-dimensional semantic behavior, which remains poorly explored.

Method: Analyzed large-scale Reddit data by embedding text into a pretrained transformer model and measuring semantic entropy to track linguistic exploration-exploitation.

Result: Found robust circadian rhythmicity in semantic entropy, with local semantic exploration peaking in the morning and global diversity peaking later, unrelated to sentiment.

Conclusion: The findings suggest biological circadian rhythms influence semantic behavior, aligning with known diurnal patterns in neuromodulatory systems.

Abstract: Human cognition exhibits strong circadian modulation, yet its influence on high-dimensional semantic behavior remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Reddit data, we quantify time-of-day variation in language use by embedding text into a pretrained transformer model and measuring semantic entropy as an index of linguistic exploration-exploitation, for which we show a robust circadian rhythmicity that could be entrained by seasonal light cues. Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with "rich-get-richer" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood. The observed temporal structure aligns with known diurnal patterns in neuromodulatory systems, suggesting that biological circadian rhythms extend to the semantic domain.

TL;DR: Created a benchmark of 200 chest radiographs with expert-verified labels using AI-assisted labeling, aiding efficient and accurate radiology assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop clinically useful multimodal LLM tools by curating high-quality benchmarks with domain expert input.

Method: Used AI (GPT-4o and Phi-4-Reasoning) to extract and map abnormal findings from reports, sampled 1,000 studies for expert review, and had 17 radiologists verify labels.

Result: Produced a publicly available benchmark of 200 radiographs with 12 labels, each verified by three experts, and an AI-assisted labeling procedure.

Conclusion: AI-assisted expert labeling enhances efficiency and accuracy, providing a valuable benchmark for radiology applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated comparable performance to that of radiology trainees on multiple-choice board-style exams. However, to develop clinically useful multimodal LLM tools, high-quality benchmarks curated by domain experts are essential. To curate released and holdout datasets of 100 chest radiographic studies each and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted expert labeling procedure to allow radiologists to label studies more efficiently. A total of 13,735 deidentified chest radiographs and their corresponding reports from the MIDRC were used. GPT-4o extracted abnormal findings from the reports, which were then mapped to 12 benchmark labels with a locally hosted LLM (Phi-4-Reasoning). From these studies, 1,000 were sampled on the basis of the AI-suggested benchmark labels for expert review; the sampling algorithm ensured that the selected studies were clinically relevant and captured a range of difficulty levels. Seventeen chest radiologists participated, and they marked "Agree all", "Agree mostly" or "Disagree" to indicate their assessment of the correctness of the LLM suggested labels. Each chest radiograph was evaluated by three experts. Of these, at least two radiologists selected "Agree All" for 381 radiographs. From this set, 200 were selected, prioritizing those with less common or multiple finding labels, and divided into 100 released radiographs and 100 reserved as the holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is used exclusively by RSNA to independently evaluate different models. A benchmark of 200 chest radiographic studies with 12 benchmark labels was created and made publicly available https://imaging.rsna.org, with each chest radiograph verified by three radiologists. In addition, an AI-assisted labeling procedure was developed to help radiologists label at scale, minimize unnecessary omissions, and support a semicollaborative environment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework is proposed to automate fine-grained rubric generation for evaluating clinical LLMs, improving safety and alignment with clinical intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing risks from LLM hallucinations and subtle clinical errors in patient care by creating scalable, verifiable evaluation rubrics grounded in medical evidence.

Method: Decomposes retrieved medical content into atomic facts and synthesizes them with user constraints to form fine-grained evaluation criteria.

Result: Achieves a Clinical Intent Alignment score of 60.12% (vs. GPT-4o's 55.16%) and nearly doubles quality separation in discriminative tests (AUROC=0.977).

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, transparent way to evaluate and refine medical LLMs, improving response quality by 9.2%.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for clinical decision support, where hallucinations and unsafe suggestions may pose direct risks to patient safety. These risks are particularly challenging as they often manifest as subtle clinical errors that evade detection by generic metrics, while expert-authored fine-grained rubrics remain costly to construct and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed to automate the generation of instance-specific evaluation rubrics. Our approach grounds evaluation in authoritative medical evidence by decomposing retrieved content into atomic facts and synthesizing them with user interaction constraints to form verifiable, fine-grained evaluation criteria. Evaluated on HealthBench, our framework achieves a Clinical Intent Alignment (CIA) score of 60.12%, a statistically significant improvement over the GPT-4o baseline (55.16%). In discriminative tests, our rubrics yield a mean score delta ($μ_Δ = 8.658$) and an AUROC of 0.977, nearly doubling the quality separation achieved by GPT-4o baseline (4.972). Beyond evaluation, our rubrics effectively guide response refinement, improving quality by 9.2% (from 59.0% to 68.2%). This provides a scalable and transparent foundation for both evaluating and improving medical LLMs. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Automated-Rubric-Generation-AF3C/.

TL;DR: The paper challenges the belief that peer review quality is declining in AI/machine learning conferences by introducing a framework for evidence-based analysis, finding no consistent decline in quality over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about declining peer review quality in growing research communities by introducing a measurable framework.

Method: Developed a multi-dimensional schema for quantifying review quality, using LLM-based and lightweight measurements, applied to ICLR, NeurIPS, and *ACL conferences.

Result: Contrary to popular belief, no consistent decline in median review quality was found across studied venues and years.

Conclusion: Provides evidence against the decline narrative and offers recommendations for future empirical studies on review quality.

Abstract: Peer review is at the heart of modern science. As submission numbers rise and research communities grow, the decline in review quality is a popular narrative and a common concern. Yet, is it true? Review quality is difficult to measure, and the ongoing evolution of reviewing practices makes it hard to compare reviews across venues and time. To address this, we introduce a new framework for evidence-based comparative study of review quality and apply it to major AI and machine learning conferences: ICLR, NeurIPS and *ACL. We document the diversity of review formats and introduce a new approach to review standardization. We propose a multi-dimensional schema for quantifying review quality as utility to editors and authors, coupled with both LLM-based and lightweight measurements. We study the relationships between measurements of review quality, and its evolution over time. Contradicting the popular narrative, our cross-temporal analysis reveals no consistent decline in median review quality across venues and years. We propose alternative explanations, and outline recommendations to facilitate future empirical studies of review quality.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of factual accuracy in legal summarization by leveraging nugget-based methods, which are currently underutilized for direct user support.

Method: The authors translate nugget-based evaluation methods to the user side and develop a prototype for legal professionals. The prototype aids in comparing summaries and manually enhancing them.

Result: The result is a functional prototype demonstrating how nugget-based approaches can support legal professionals in evaluating and improving summaries.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the untapped potential of nugget-based methods for direct user assistance in the legal domain, offering practical tools for summary evaluation and enhancement.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to summarize long documents, this trend poses significant challenges in the legal domain, where the factual accuracy of deposition summaries is crucial. Nugget-based methods have been shown to be extremely helpful for the automated evaluation of summarization approaches. In this work, we translate these methods to the user side and explore how nuggets could directly assist end users. Although prior systems have demonstrated the promise of nugget-based evaluation, its potential to support end users remains underexplored. Focusing on the legal domain, we present a prototype that leverages a factual nugget-based approach to support legal professionals in two concrete scenarios: (1) determining which of two summaries is better, and (2) manually improving an automatically generated summary.

*Anmol Goel,Cornelius Emde,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh,Martin Gubri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning frontier language models can lead to privacy collapse, where models lose contextual privacy reasoning despite maintaining performance on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to uncover how benign fine-tuning can inadvertently degrade privacy in language models, revealing gaps in current safety evaluations.

Method: The authors experiment with six models, five fine-tuning datasets, and two task categories, analyzing privacy vulnerabilities through mechanistic analysis.

Result: Fine-tuned models exhibit privacy collapse, sharing information inappropriately and violating contextual boundaries, while task-relevant features remain intact.

Conclusion: Privacy collapse highlights a silent failure in safety evaluations, emphasizing the need for improved assessments, especially for specialized agents.

Abstract: We identify a novel phenomenon in language models: benign fine-tuning of frontier models can lead to privacy collapse. We find that diverse, subtle patterns in training data can degrade contextual privacy, including optimisation for helpfulness, exposure to user information, emotional and subjective dialogue, and debugging code printing internal variables, among others. Fine-tuned models lose their ability to reason about contextual privacy norms, share information inappropriately with tools, and violate memory boundaries across contexts. Privacy collapse is a ``silent failure'' because models maintain high performance on standard safety and utility benchmarks whilst exhibiting severe privacy vulnerabilities. Our experiments show evidence of privacy collapse across six models (closed and open weight), five fine-tuning datasets (real-world and controlled data), and two task categories (agentic and memory-based). Our mechanistic analysis reveals that privacy representations are uniquely fragile to fine-tuning, compared to task-relevant features which are preserved. Our results reveal a critical gap in current safety evaluations, in particular for the deployment of specialised agents.

*Anjishnu Mukherjee,Ziwei Zhu,Antonios Anastasopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Metadata conditioning improves localization in large language models without harming cross-region performance, achieving comparable accuracy to larger models with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the geographically homogenized behavior of large language models by using metadata conditioning for localization.

Method: Pre-trained 31 models on English news data annotated with URLs, country, and continent tags, covering 17 countries and 4 continents.

Result: Metadata conditioning enhances in-region performance, maintains cross-region generalization, and improves learning efficiency.

Conclusion: Metadata conditioning is a practical and efficient method for localizing language models.

Abstract: Large language models are typically trained by treating text as a single global distribution, often resulting in geographically homogenized behavior. We study metadata conditioning as a lightweight approach for localization, pre-training 31 models (at 0.5B and 1B parameter scales) from scratch on large-scale English news data annotated with verified URLs, country tags, and continent tags, covering 4 continents and 17 countries. Across four controlled experiments, we show that metadata conditioning consistently improves in-region performance without sacrificing cross-region generalization, enables global models to recover localization comparable to region-specific models, and improves learning efficiency. Our ablation studies demonstrate that URL-level metadata alone captures much of the geographic signal, while balanced regional data coverage remains essential, as metadata cannot fully compensate for missing regions. Finally, we introduce a downstream benchmark of 800 localized news MCQs and show that after instruction tuning, metadata conditioned global models achieve accuracy comparable to LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct, despite being trained on substantially less data. Together, these results establish metadata conditioning as a practical and compute-efficient approach for localization of language models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-stage pipeline for extracting structured risk factors from corporate filings using LLMs, embedding-based mapping, and validation, achieving high accuracy and proposing autonomous taxonomy maintenance for continuous improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to automate the extraction of structured risk factors from unstructured corporate filings while adhering to a predefined taxonomy, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in financial analysis.

Method: The method involves a three-stage pipeline: LLM extraction with supporting quotes, semantic mapping to taxonomy categories using embeddings, and LLM-as-a-judge validation to filter spurious assignments. Autonomous taxonomy maintenance is also introduced for continuous improvement.

Result: The approach extracted 10,688 risk factors with high accuracy, showing 63% higher risk profile similarity within industries compared to cross-industry pairs. Autonomous maintenance improved embedding separation by 104.7%.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively generalizes to taxonomy-aligned extraction tasks, with autonomous maintenance ensuring continuous quality enhancement as more documents are processed.

Abstract: We present a methodology for extracting structured risk factors from corporate 10-K filings while maintaining adherence to a predefined hierarchical taxonomy. Our three-stage pipeline combines LLM extraction with supporting quotes, embedding-based semantic mapping to taxonomy categories, and LLM-as-a-judge validation that filters spurious assignments. To evaluate our approach, we extract 10,688 risk factors from S&P 500 companies and examine risk profile similarity across industry clusters. Beyond extraction, we introduce autonomous taxonomy maintenance where an AI agent analyzes evaluation feedback to identify problematic categories, diagnose failure patterns, and propose refinements, achieving 104.7% improvement in embedding separation in a case study. External validation confirms the taxonomy captures economically meaningful structure: same-industry companies exhibit 63% higher risk profile similarity than cross-industry pairs (Cohen's d=1.06, AUC 0.82, p<0.001). The methodology generalizes to any domain requiring taxonomy-aligned extraction from unstructured text, with autonomous improvement enabling continuous quality maintenance and enhancement as systems process more documents.

Conclusion: The study reveals a challenge in multilingual numerical reasoning and offers actionable solutions for improving LLM performance in diverse numeral contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive proficiency in basic arithmetic, rivaling human-level performance on standard numerical tasks. However, little attention has been given to how these models perform when numerical expressions deviate from the prevailing conventions present in their training corpora. In this work, we investigate numerical reasoning across a wide range of numeral scripts and formats. We show that LLM accuracy drops substantially when numerical inputs are rendered in underrepresented scripts or formats, despite the underlying mathematical reasoning being identical. We further demonstrate that targeted prompting strategies, such as few-shot prompting and explicit numeral mapping, can greatly narrow this gap. Our findings highlight an overlooked challenge in multilingual numerical reasoning and provide actionable insights for working with LLMs to reliably interpret, manipulate, and generate numbers across diverse numeral scripts and formatting styles.

### [124] [Robust Fake News Detection using Large Language Models under Adversarial Sentiment Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15277)
*Sahar Tahmasebi,Eric Müller-Budack,Ralph Ewerth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdSent, a sentiment-robust framework to detect fake news, addressing vulnerabilities posed by sentiment manipulation via LLMs. It proposes controlled attacks, analyzes sentiment impact, and introduces a sentiment-agnostic training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation detection is vulnerable to sentiment manipulation, especially with LLMs. Prior work overlooked this, focusing on stylistic features.

Method: AdSent employs controlled sentiment-based adversarial attacks using LLMs, analyzes sentiment shift impacts, and introduces sentiment-agnostic training.

Result: Sentiment changes heavily affect detection models, showing biases. AdSent outperforms baselines in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: AdSent enhances robustness against sentiment manipulation and generalizes well to unseen datasets and adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: Misinformation and fake news have become a pressing societal challenge, driving the need for reliable automated detection methods. Prior research has highlighted sentiment as an important signal in fake news detection, either by analyzing which sentiments are associated with fake news or by using sentiment and emotion features for classification. However, this poses a vulnerability since adversaries can manipulate sentiment to evade detectors especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs). A few studies have explored adversarial samples generated by LLMs, but they mainly focus on stylistic features such as writing style of news publishers. Thus, the crucial vulnerability of sentiment manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art fake news detectors under sentiment manipulation. We introduce AdSent, a sentiment-robust detection framework designed to ensure consistent veracity predictions across both original and sentiment-altered news articles. Specifically, we (1) propose controlled sentiment-based adversarial attacks using LLMs, (2) analyze the impact of sentiment shifts on detection performance. We show that changing the sentiment heavily impacts the performance of fake news detection models, indicating biases towards neutral articles being real, while non-neutral articles are often classified as fake content. (3) We introduce a novel sentiment-agnostic training strategy that enhances robustness against such perturbations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdSent significantly outperforms competitive baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while also generalizing effectively to unseen datasets and adversarial scenarios.

*Xiao Xue,Deyu Zhou,Ming Zhang,Xiangning Yu,Fei-Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper discusses the study of system complexity, emphasizing pattern exploration and theoretical explanations, and introduces computational experiments as a robust tool for causal inference, addressing limitations of Agent-Based Modeling (ABM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore patterns and develop theories for system complexity, and to overcome the limitations of ABM, which focuses more on simulation than experimentation.

Method: Proposes computational experiments, which involve systematic adjustment of input variables to observe output changes, enabling causal inference and counterfactual analysis.

Result: Computational experiments provide deeper insights into system dynamics and causal relationships, complementing traditional ABM approaches.

Conclusion: Computational experiments offer a powerful method to understand system complexity, bridging gaps left by ABM and conventional scenario analysis, and setting the stage for further research.

Abstract: The study of system complexity primarily has two objectives: to explore underlying patterns and to develop theoretical explanations. Pattern exploration seeks to clarify the mechanisms behind the emergence of system complexity, while theoretical explanations aim to identify the fundamental causes of this complexity. Laws are generally defined as mappings between variables, whereas theories offer causal explanations of system behavior. Agent Based Modeling(ABM) is an important approach for studying complex systems, but it tends to emphasize simulation over experimentation. As a result, ABM often struggles to deeply uncover the governing operational principles. Unlike conventional scenario analysis that relies on human reasoning, computational experiments emphasize counterfactual experiments-that is, creating parallel worlds that simulate alternative "evolutionary paths" of real-world events. By systematically adjusting input variables and observing the resulting changes in output variables, computational experiments provide a robust tool for causal inference, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional ABM. Together, these methods offer causal insights into the dynamic evolution of systems. This part can help readers gain a preliminary understanding of the entire computational experiment method, laying the foundation for the subsequent study.

*Seán Caulfield Curley,Karl Mason,Patrick Mannion*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A microsimulation predicts future self-rated health in Ireland using socio-economic data, disaggregated spatially, with ordinal regression for accuracy and alignment adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To forecast individual health outcomes for future populations, aiding local authorities in proactive health planning.

Method: Uses open-source microsimulation and ordinal regression, disaggregated at Electoral Division level, with alignment for accuracy.

Result: Matches Ireland's 2022 health distribution; ageing population may slightly worsen mean self-rated health despite socio-economic improvements.

Conclusion: Granular health modeling helps predict and address future health issues locally.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for predicting the self-rated health of individuals in a future population utilising the individuals' socio-economic characteristics. An open-source microsimulation is used to project Ireland's population into the future where each individual is defined by a number of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The model is disaggregated spatially at the Electoral Division level, allowing for analysis of results at that, or any broader geographical scales. Ordinal regression is utilised to predict an individual's self-rated health based on their socio-economic characteristics and this method is shown to match well to Ireland's 2022 distribution of health statuses. Due to differences in the health status distributions of the health microdata and the national data, an alignment technique is proposed to bring predictions closer to real values. It is illustrated for one potential future population that the effects of an ageing population may outweigh other improvements in socio-economic outcomes to disimprove Ireland's mean self-rated health slightly. Health modelling at this kind of granular scale could offer local authorities a chance to predict and combat health issues which may arise in their local populations in the future.

*Gopal Vijayaraghavan,Prasanth Jayachandran,Arun Murthy,Sunil Govindan,Vivek Subramanian*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes using AI agent teams with strict roles and opposing incentives to catch errors, achieving reliability through orchestration of imperfect components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address AI agents' fallibility (miscommunications, biases, lack of introspection) by creating a safe, productive environment without requiring perfect components.

Method: Specialized agent teams (planners, executors, critics, experts) organized with clear goals, coordinated via remote code execution to separate reasoning from data transformations.

Result: The system intercepts over 90% of errors before user exposure, with acceptable latency tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Team-based AI architectures can achieve reliability and correctness without perfect components, balancing cost, latency, and capability expansion.

Abstract: AI Agents can perform complex operations at great speed, but just like all the humans we have ever hired, their intelligence remains fallible. Miscommunications aren't noticed, systemic biases have no counter-action, and inner monologues are rarely written down.
  We did not come to fire them for their mistakes, but to hire them and provide a safe productive working environment. We posit that we can reuse a common corporate organizational structure: teams of independent AI agents with strict role boundaries can work with common goals, but opposing incentives. Multiple models serving as a team of rivals can catch and minimize errors within the final product at a small cost to the velocity of actions. In this paper we demonstrate that we can achieve reliability without acquiring perfect components, but through careful orchestration of imperfect ones.
  This paper describes the architecture of such a system in practice: specialized agent teams (planners, executors, critics, experts), organized into an organization with clear goals, coordinated through a remote code executor that keeps data transformations and tool invocations separate from reasoning models. Rather than agents directly calling tools and ingesting full responses, they write code that executes remotely; only relevant summaries return to agent context. By preventing raw data and tool outputs from contaminating context windows, the system maintains clean separation between perception (brains that plan and reason) and execution (hands that perform heavy data transformations and API calls). We demonstrate the approach achieves over 90% internal error interception prior to user exposure while maintaining acceptable latency tradeoffs. A survey from our traces shows that we only trade off cost and latency to achieve correctness and incrementally expand capabilities without impacting existing ones.

### [128] [Agent Identity URI Scheme: Topology-Independent Naming and Capability-Based Discovery for Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14567)
*Roland R. Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes the agent:// URI scheme to decouple agent identity from network location, addressing flaws in multi-agent systems by enabling stable references, semantic discovery, and cross-organization federation with cryptographic attestation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current URI-based identity schemes in multi-agent systems fail when agents migrate, scale, or federate, causing broken references and fragmented audit trails.

Method: Introduces the agent:// URI scheme with trust roots, hierarchical capability paths, and unique identifiers. Uses DHT key derivation for discovery and PASETO tokens for attestation.

Result: Achieves 100% capability coverage, F1=1.0 discovery precision, migration invariance, and sub-5μs performance.

Conclusion: The agent:// scheme offers a robust, decentralized solution for agent identity and capability-based discovery.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems face a fundamental architectural flaw: agent identity is bound to network location. When agents migrate between providers, scale across instances, or federate across organizations, URI-based identity schemes break references, fragment audit trails, and require centralized coordination. We propose the agent:// URI scheme, which decouples identity from topology through three orthogonal components: a trust root establishing organizational authority, a hierarchical capability path enabling semantic discovery, and a sortable unique identifier providing stable reference. The scheme enables capability-based discovery through DHT key derivation, where queries return agents by what they do rather than where they are. Trust-root scoping prevents cross-organization pollution while permitting federation when desired. Cryptographic attestation via PASETO tokens binds capability claims to agent identity, enabling verification without real-time contact with the issuing authority. We evaluate the scheme across four dimensions: capability expressiveness (100% coverage on 369 production tools with zero collision), discovery precision (F1=1.0 across 10,000 agents), identity stability (formal proofs of migration invariance), and performance (all operations under 5 microseconds). The agent:// URI scheme provides a formally-specified, practically-evaluated foundation for decentralized agent identity and capability-based discovery.

*Yijin Zhou,Xiaoya Lu,Dongrui Liu,Junchi Yan,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: INFA-Guard is a defense framework addressing infected agents in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems, reducing Attack Success Rate by 33%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safeguards fail to account for infected agents, necessitating a specialized defense framework.

Method: INFA-Guard uses infection-aware detection and topological constraints to identify threats.

Result: Reduces ASR by 33%, shows cross-model robustness, and maintains topological integrity.

Conclusion: INFA-Guard effectively mitigates malicious propagation while preserving system integrity.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, where malicious influence can propagate virally through inter-agent communication. Conventional safeguards often rely on a binary paradigm that strictly distinguishes between benign and attack agents, failing to account for infected agents i.e., benign entities converted by attack agents. In this paper, we propose Infection-Aware Guard, INFA-Guard, a novel defense framework that explicitly identifies and addresses infected agents as a distinct threat category. By leveraging infection-aware detection and topological constraints, INFA-Guard accurately localizes attack sources and infected ranges. During remediation, INFA-Guard replaces attackers and rehabilitates infected ones, avoiding malicious propagation while preserving topological integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that INFA-Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average of 33%, while exhibiting cross-model robustness, superior topological generalization, and high cost-effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper surveys LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) using game theory, organizing research around players, strategies, payoffs, and information for a unified framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on LLM-based MAS is fragmented and lacks a unifying theoretical foundation, prompting the need for a systematic approach.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive survey, analyzing studies through a game-theoretic lens, focusing on players, strategies, payoffs, and information.

Result: A systematic framework is established to understand, compare, and guide future research on LLM-based MAS.

Conclusion: The game-theoretic approach provides a solid foundation for advancing the study of LLM-based multi-agent systems and their social dynamics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning, planning, and communication abilities, enabling them to operate as autonomous agents in open environments. While single-agent systems remain limited in adaptability and coordination, recent progress has shifted attention toward multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of interacting LLMs that pursue cooperative, competitive, or mixed objectives. This emerging paradigm provides a powerful testbed for studying social dynamics and strategic behaviors among intelligent agents. However, current research remains fragmented and lacks a unifying theoretical foundation. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey of LLM-based multi-agent systems through a game-theoretic lens. By organizing existing studies around the four key elements of game theory: players, strategies, payoffs, and information, we establish a systematic framework for understanding, comparing, and guiding future research on the design and analysis of LLM-based MAS.

*Valerio La Gatta,Gian Marco Orlando,Marco Perillo,Ferdinando Tammaro,Vincenzo Moscato*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces behavioral traits in Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) to address homogeneous engagement patterns in social media simulations, demonstrating their necessity for realistic content propagation dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GABM frameworks lack mechanisms to encode agents' behavioral dispositions toward platform actions, leading to unrealistic homogeneity in agent engagement patterns compared to real social media.

Method: The study investigates behavioral traits (e.g., posting, re-sharing, commenting) as an explicit layer in GABM. It conducts large-scale simulations with 980 agents and validates against real-world social media data.

Result: Behavioral traits are shown to sustain heterogeneous, profile-consistent participation patterns and enable realistic content propagation dynamics by differentiating between amplification- and interaction-oriented agent profiles.

Conclusion: Modeling behavioral traits ('how agents act') is essential for advancing GABM as a tool for studying social media phenomena, complementing traditional focus on attributes like demographics and personality.

Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) leverages Large Language Models to create autonomous agents that simulate human behavior in social media environments, demonstrating potential for modeling information propagation, influence processes, and network phenomena. While existing frameworks characterize agents through demographic attributes, personality traits, and interests, they lack mechanisms to encode behavioral dispositions toward platform actions, causing agents to exhibit homogeneous engagement patterns rather than the differentiated participation styles observed on real platforms. In this paper, we investigate the role of behavioral traits as an explicit characterization layer to regulate agents' propensities across posting, re-sharing, commenting, reacting, and inactivity. Through large-scale simulations involving 980 agents and validation against real-world social media data, we demonstrate that behavioral traits are essential to sustain heterogeneous, profile-consistent participation patterns and enable realistic content propagation dynamics through the interplay of amplification- and interaction-oriented profiles. Our findings establish that modeling how agents act-not only who they are-is necessary for advancing GABM as a tool for studying social media phenomena.

*Denise M. Case*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that an ontology cannot be neutral if it includes causal or normative commitments, requiring neutral substrates to be pre-causal and pre-normative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accountability in data systems amid persistent disagreements, ensuring stability and shared representation across conflicting frameworks.

Method: The study establishes an impossibility result for ontological neutrality, analyzing the constraints on ontology design to avoid interpretive commitment.

Result: Neutrality is incompatible with foundational causal or normative commitments; neutral substrates must exclude these to remain stable and shared.

Conclusion: Designing neutral ontological substrates necessitates excluding causal or normative facts, focusing instead on entities and their persistence conditions.

Abstract: Modern data systems must support accountability across persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement. This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate. We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality: neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer. Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation. This paper does not propose a specific ontology or protocol; rather, it establishes the necessary design constraints for any system intended to maintain a shared, stable representation of reality across conflicting interpretive frameworks.

*Michele Loi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for an explicit epistemic constitution for AI to govern belief-forming behavior, addressing biases like source attribution bias. It contrasts Platonic and Liberal approaches, favoring the latter for collective inquiry conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to regulate AI's implicit belief-forming policies, using source attribution bias as a case study to highlight the need for explicit epistemic norms.

Method: It analyzes frontier models' handling of source-sensitive arguments and distinguishes between Platonic (formal correctness) and Liberal (procedural norms) constitutional approaches.

Result: Models penalize arguments conflicting with expected ideological positions but suppress this bias when tested systematically. The Liberal approach is proposed as preferable.

Conclusion: The paper argues for AI epistemic governance modeled on AI ethics, proposing a Liberal constitutional core with principles and orientations for collective inquiry.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly function as artificial reasoners: they evaluate arguments, assign credibility, and express confidence. Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.

*Saeed Khaki,Ashudeep Singh,Nima Safaei,Kamal Ginotra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with math problems in image form compared to text. The paper introduces VisTIRA for tool-integrated problem solving and a framework to improve visual math reasoning, showing that structured reasoning and OCR grounding help narrow the modality gap, especially for smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance gap between text and image-based math reasoning in VLMs by identifying the 'modality gap' and proposing solutions to improve visual math reasoning.

Method: Develop VisTIRA, a tool-integrated reasoning framework for decomposing math problems into steps, and create a LaTeX-based pipeline to generate image-based math problems and synthetic tool-use trajectories for fine-tuning VLMs.

Result: Tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding benefits smaller models, though its impact decreases with larger models. The modality gap severity is inversely proportional to model size.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning and OCR grounding are effective, complementary strategies for enhancing visual math reasoning in VLMs, with the modality gap narrowing as model size increases.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) lag behind text-only language models on mathematical reasoning when the same problems are presented as images rather than text. We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.

*Valerio Belcamino,Nicholas Attolino,Alessio Capitanelli,Fulvio Mastrogiovanni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs show high valid plan rates in-domain but fail (0%) cross-domain, indicating reliance on domain-specific patterns, not transferable planning skills. Diagnostic tools reveal sensitivity to surface representations, with no improvement in generalization despite interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether fine-tuned LLMs' high valid plan rates stem from transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization.

Method: Fine-tuned a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains. Evaluated in-domain and cross-domain generalization using diagnostic interventions: symbol anonymization, compact plan serialization, and verifier-reward fine-tuning.

Result: In-domain valid plan rate: 82.9%; cross-domain: 0%. Interventions revealed surface representation sensitivity and no improvement in generalization. Performance plateaus at ~80% in-domain but collapses cross-domain.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs rely heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence, highlighting a generalization gap in LLM-based planning.

Abstract: Recent work shows that fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve high valid plan rates on PDDL planning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes.

*Yuan Tian,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper improves scalability in dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism within a genetic programming framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activity group selection strategies face scalability issues in large-scale problems, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: A knee-point-based selection mechanism identifies promising activity subsets, followed by a group selection rule. A multi-tree GP framework evolves both rules.

Result: The approach scales well to large instances and outperforms sequential decision-making GP in most scenarios.

Conclusion: The enhanced strategy effectively addresses scalability while maintaining performance in large-scale scheduling problems.

Abstract: The dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem is a challenging scheduling problem that requires making decisions on both the execution order of activities and their corresponding execution modes. Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios.

*Tony Chen,Sam Cheyette,Kelsey Allen,Joshua Tenenbaum,Kevin Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A 'Just-in-Time' framework is proposed for efficient mental simulation by dynamically simplifying representations during reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human simulation capacity is limited in complex environments, prompting exploration of how people efficiently simplify representations.

Method: The framework interleaves simulation, visual search, and representation modification, encoding only relevant objects dynamically.

Result: The model produces high-utility predictions with strong empirical support in grid-world planning and physical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The results provide an algorithmic account of efficient mental simulation through reduced representations.

Abstract: Probabilistic mental simulation is thought to play a key role in human reasoning, planning, and prediction, yet the demands of simulation in complex environments exceed realistic human capacity limits. A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a "Just-in-Time" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation.

TL;DR: PhyloEvolve is an LLM-agent system that optimizes GPU algorithms using trajectory-conditioned reinforcement learning, outperforming baseline methods in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GPU algorithm optimization is labor-intensive and iterative, lacking reuse of trajectory information generated during optimization.

Method: PhyloEvolve uses In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL), Algorithm Distillation, prompt-based Decision Transformers, and a phylogenetic tree representation to organize and reuse optimization history.

Result: The system improves runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness in scientific computing workloads compared to baseline and evolutionary methods.

Conclusion: PhyloEvolve effectively optimizes GPU algorithms by leveraging trajectory information and balancing exploration-exploitation, achieving consistent performance gains.

Abstract: Optimizing scientific computing algorithms for modern GPUs is a labor-intensive and iterative process involving repeated code modification, benchmarking, and tuning across complex hardware and software stacks. Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

Motivation: Current MAS designs lack global reasoning and efficacy certainty, limiting their benefits over single-agent systems.

Method: MAS-Orchestra abstracts agents as callable functions for global orchestration and introduces MASBENCH for task characterization.

Result: MAS gains depend on task structure and agent capabilities, with MAS-Orchestra improving performance on benchmarks like math reasoning and QA.

Conclusion: MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enhance MAS training and understanding, advancing multi-agent intelligence.

Abstract: While multi-agent systems (MAS) promise elevated intelligence through coordination of agents, current approaches to automatic MAS design under-deliver. Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence.

### [140] [Query-Efficient Agentic Graph Extraction Attacks on GraphRAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14662)
*Shuhua Yang,Jiahao Zhang,Yilong Wang,Dongwon Lee,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AGEA, a novel attack framework, effectively steals latent entity-relation graphs from GraphRAG systems under strict query budgets by combining exploration-exploitation strategies and LLM-based filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the vulnerability of GraphRAG systems to query-efficient reconstruction attacks under realistic query budgets, addressing a gap in prior work.

Method: AGEA uses a novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, external graph memory, and a two-stage pipeline (lightweight discovery + LLM-based filtering) to extract hidden graphs.

Result: AGEA recovers up to 90% of entities and relationships with high precision, outperforming prior attacks under identical query budgets.

Conclusion: Modern GraphRAG systems are highly vulnerable to structured agentic attacks like AGEA, even with strict query limits.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) systems construct knowledge graphs over document collections to support multi-hop reasoning. While prior work shows that GraphRAG responses may leak retrieved subgraphs, the feasibility of query-efficient reconstruction of the hidden graph structure remains unexplored under realistic query budgets. We study a budget-constrained black-box setting where an adversary adaptively queries the system to steal its latent entity-relation graph. We propose AGEA (Agentic Graph Extraction Attack), a framework that leverages a novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, external graph memory modules, and a two-stage graph extraction pipeline combining lightweight discovery with LLM-based filtering. We evaluate AGEA on medical, agriculture, and literary datasets across Microsoft-GraphRAG and LightRAG systems. Under identical query budgets, AGEA significantly outperforms prior attack baselines, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships while maintaining high precision. These results demonstrate that modern GraphRAG systems are highly vulnerable to structured, agentic extraction attacks, even under strict query limits.

### [141] [Local Language Models for Context-Aware Adaptive Anonymization of Sensitive Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14683)
*Aisvarya Adeseye,Jouni Isoaho,Seppo Virtanen,Mohammad Tahir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SFAA uses local LLMs for context-aware anonymization in qualitative research, outperforming manual methods and traditional tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual anonymization is inefficient and inconsistent; existing automated tools lack context-awareness.

Method: Introduces SFAA with detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization using rule-based substitution, rewriting, generalization, and suppression.

Result: LLMs (especially Phi) detected more sensitive data than humans, with high accuracy (91% detection, 94.8% sentiment preservation).

Conclusion: SFAA is effective for privacy-preserving anonymization in qualitative research, balancing accuracy and context.

Abstract: Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.

*Shuai Wang,Yaoming Yang,Bingdong Li,Hao Hao,Aimin Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IB-GRPO improves LLM-based Learning Path Recommendation by addressing pedagogical alignment, data scarcity, and multi-objective trade-offs using hybrid expert demonstrations and group-relative optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with pedagogical objectives like ZPD alignment, sparse feedback, and multi-objective balancing in Learning Path Recommendation.

Method: Hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm and teacher RL agents warm-start the LLM. IB-GRPO uses a ZPD alignment score and $I_{ε+}$ dominance indicator for optimization.

Result: IB-GRPO outperforms RL and LLM baselines on ASSIST09 and Junyi datasets using the KES simulator with Qwen2.5-7B.

Conclusion: IB-GRPO effectively addresses key challenges in LLM-based LPR, demonstrating superior performance and alignment with pedagogical goals.

Abstract: Learning Path Recommendation (LPR) aims to generate personalized sequences of learning items that maximize long-term learning effect while respecting pedagogical principles and operational constraints. Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{ε+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs. Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi using the KES simulator with a Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over representative RL and LLM baselines.

*Muhammad Khalifa,Lajanugen Logeswaran,Jaekyeom Kim,Sungryull Sohn,Yunxiang Zhang,Moontae Lee,Hao Peng,Lu Wang,Honglak Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM judges evaluating agent performance are vulnerable to manipulated reasoning traces, with false positive rates increasing significantly. Content-based manipulations are more effective than style-based ones, and current mitigation techniques are insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to expose vulnerabilities in LLM-based evaluation systems, particularly focusing on how manipulated reasoning traces can mislead judgments, undermining their reliability.

Method: Researchers systematically rewrote agent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces while keeping actions and observations constant. They tested manipulation strategies like style-based (presentation changes) and content-based (fabricated progress signals) approaches across 800 web task trajectories.

Result: False positive rates surged by up to 90%. Content-based manipulations were more impactful than style-based ones. Prompting techniques and increased compute reduced but did not eliminate susceptibility.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation systems have a critical flaw due to their reliance on unverified reasoning traces. The study calls for mechanisms that cross-check reasoning against observable evidence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to evaluate agent performance, particularly in non-verifiable settings where judgments rely on agent trajectories including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.

TL;DR: AutoDriDM is a new benchmark focusing on decision-making in autonomous driving, evaluating VLMs' capabilities beyond perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks prioritize perception over decision-making, leaving a gap in assessing safe and reliable autonomous driving.

Method: AutoDriDM introduces 6,650 questions across Object, Scene, and Decision dimensions, evaluating VLMs and analyzing correlations between perception and decision-making.

Result: Weak alignment between perception and decision-making is found, with identified failure modes like logical reasoning errors.

Conclusion: AutoDriDM bridges the perception-decision evaluation gap, guiding safer VLMs for real-world autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is a highly challenging domain that requires reliable perception and safe decision-making in complex scenarios. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRPO-Adaptive and DARA improve AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB) by combining LLMs' in-context learning with fine-grained optimization, outperforming traditional methods under budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advertisers face challenges optimizing value with limited data; traditional RL struggles, while LLMs lack numerical precision.

Method: GRPO-Adaptive enhances LLMs' reasoning and precision, while DARA uses a dual-phase framework: few-shot reasoning followed by feedback-driven optimization.

Result: Experiments show DARA outperforms baselines in cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively integrates LLMs' strengths with AIGB requirements.

Abstract: Optimizing the advertiser's cumulative value of winning impressions under budget constraints poses a complex challenge in online advertising, under the paradigm of AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB). Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.

TL;DR: This survey explores ASP explanations from an XAI perspective, reviewing types of explanations and their coverage by current tools, while identifying gaps and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the increasing importance of explainable and interpretive reasoning in AI, especially ASP, by systematically reviewing existing explanation approaches and their limitations.

Method: The method involves surveying existing ASP explanation approaches and tools, categorizing them based on user questions for explanation, and analyzing their coverage.

Result: The result highlights gaps in current ASP explanation approaches and identifies scenarios not covered by existing tools.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the need for further research to expand ASP explanation methods to address uncovered scenarios and improve interpretability.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a popular declarative reasoning and problem solving approach in symbolic AI. Its rule-based formalism makes it inherently attractive for explainable and interpretive reasoning, which is gaining importance with the surge of Explainable AI (XAI). A number of explanation approaches and tools for ASP have been developed, which often tackle specific explanatory settings and may not cover all scenarios that ASP users encounter. In this survey, we provide, guided by an XAI perspective, an overview of types of ASP explanations in connection with user questions for explanation, and describe how their coverage by current theory and tools. Furthermore, we pinpoint gaps in existing ASP explanations approaches and identify research directions for future work.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method that improves keyframe selection using semantic alignment and adversarial training, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised video summarization methods rely on unimodal features and GANs, often ignoring semantic information and facing unstable training. This work aims to address these issues.

Method: Proposes a frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism integrated into a keyframe selector within a GAN framework. Uses an incremental training strategy to stabilize training.

Result: The method achieves superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets by effectively leveraging semantic guidance and mitigating training instability.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic-guided approach enhances video summarization by addressing limitations of existing methods, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and stability.

Abstract: Video summarization is a crucial technique for social understanding, enabling efficient browsing of massive multimedia content and extraction of key information from social platforms. Most existing unsupervised summarization methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance keyframe selection and generate coherent, video summaries through adversarial training. However, such approaches primarily exploit unimodal features, overlooking the guiding role of semantic information in keyframe selection, and often suffer from unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method. Specifically, we design a novel frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism and integrate it into a keyframe selector, which guides the Transformer-based generator within the adversarial framework to better reconstruct videos. In addition, we adopt an incremental training strategy to progressively update the model components, effectively mitigating the instability of GAN training. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

### [148] [Towards Bound Consistency for the No-Overlap Constraint Using MDDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14784)
*Amaury Guichard,Laurent Michel,Hélène Verhaeghe,Pierre Schaus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint, using an MDD-based approach to tighten job time windows and improve search efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NP-completeness of bound consistency for no-overlap constraints motivates the need for efficient, polynomial-time tightening techniques.

Method: Builds on the no-overlap MDD by Ciré and van Hoeve, extracts time window bounds, and limits MDD width for practicality.

Result: The proposed filtering reduces nodes visited in the search tree and complements classical propagation methods.

Conclusion: The algorithm enhances efficiency and performance in solving sequencing problems with time windows.

Abstract: Achieving bound consistency for the no-overlap constraint is known to be NP-complete. Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Ciré and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \mid r_j, d_j, \bar{d}_j \mid \sum E_j + \sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Ciré and van Hoeve. The new filtering also appears to be complementary to classical propagation methods for the no-overlap constraint, allowing a substantial reduction in both the number of nodes and the solving time on several instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve agent handling of fine-grained web interactions by designing interfaces tailored for agents, rather than adapting agents to human-centric designs.

Method: Developed CI4A, a semantic encapsulation mechanism for UI components, integrated with Ant Design, and created a hybrid agent with dynamic action space.

Result: Achieved 86.3% task success rate, surpassing existing methods, with enhanced execution efficiency.

Conclusion: CI4A effectively bridges the gap in agent-web interaction, setting a new benchmark for performance.

Abstract: While Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in high-level semantic planning, they remain limited in handling fine-grained, low-level web component manipulations. To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the CI4A-based agent significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new SoTA task success rate of 86.3%, alongside substantial improvements in execution efficiency.

Motivation: Standard flat metrics fail to distinguish between clinically minor and severe errors, necessitating hierarchical evaluation for safer VLM deployment.

Method: Benchmark VLMs using hierarchical metrics, introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors, and propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings.

Result: Substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies identified; proposed methods reduce severe abstraction errors below 2% while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment are critical for clinically meaningful VLM deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models show strong zero-shot performance for chest X-ray classification, but standard flat metrics fail to distinguish between clinically minor and severe errors. This work investigates how to quantify and mitigate abstraction errors by leveraging medical taxonomies. We benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs using hierarchical metrics and introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors to capture cross-branch mistakes. Our results reveal substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance. To address this, we propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings, which reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2 per cent while maintaining competitive performance. These findings highlight the importance of hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment for safer and more clinically meaningful deployment of VLMs.

Motivation: The integration gap between modern software engineering (OOP) and KR&R systems, which often rely on external ontologies and specialized languages, motivates KRROOD.

Method: KRROOD treats knowledge as a first-class programming abstraction using native class structures, bridging logic programming and OOP.

Result: Evaluation on OWL2Bench and a human-robot task learning scenario shows KRROOD achieves strong performance with expressive reasoning.

Conclusion: KRROOD successfully integrates KR&R with OOP, supporting real-world autonomous systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces KRROOD, a framework designed to bridge the integration gap between modern software engineering and Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KR&R) systems. While Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the standard for developing complex applications, existing KR&R frameworks often rely on external ontologies and specialized languages that are difficult to integrate with imperative code. KRROOD addresses this by treating knowledge as a first-class programming abstraction using native class structures, bridging the gap between the logic programming and OOP paradigms. We evaluate the system on the OWL2Bench benchmark and a human-robot task learning scenario. Experimental results show that KRROOD achieves strong performance while supporting the expressive reasoning required for real-world autonomous systems.

Motivation: Enhance neural network reliability by ensuring predictions align with domain-specific knowledge formalized in ontologies.

Method: Encode Description Logic ontologies as differentiable circuits for synthetic dataset generation, efficient reasoning, and neuro-symbolic modeling.

Result: Synthetic datasets capture ontology semantics, reasoning is faster than existing methods, and classifiers outperform neural baselines.

Conclusion: Compiling ontologies into circuits bridges Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation, enabling versatile and scalable solutions.

Abstract: Background: Neuro-symbolic methods enhance the reliability of neural network classifiers through logical constraints, but they lack native support for ontologies.
  Objectives: We aim to develop a neuro-symbolic method that reliably outputs predictions consistent with a Description Logic ontology that formalizes domain-specific knowledge.
  Methods: We encode a Description Logic ontology as a circuit, a feed-forward differentiable computational graph that supports tractable execution of queries and transformations. We show that the circuit can be used to (i) generate synthetic datasets that capture the semantics of the ontology; (ii) efficiently perform deductive reasoning on a GPU; (iii) implement neuro-symbolic models whose predictions are approximately or provably consistent with the knowledge defined in the ontology.
  Results We show that the synthetic dataset generated using the circuit qualitatively captures the semantics of the ontology while being challenging for Machine Learning classifiers, including neural networks. Moreover, we show that compiling the ontology into a circuit is a promising approach for scalable deductive reasoning, with runtimes up to three orders of magnitude faster than available reasoners. Finally, we show that our neuro-symbolic classifiers reliably produce consistent predictions when compared to neural network baselines, maintaining competitive performances or even outperforming them.
  Conclusions By compiling Description Logic ontologies into circuits, we obtain a tighter integration between the Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation fields. We show that a single circuit representation can be used to tackle different challenging tasks closely related to real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for evaluating awareness in AI systems, focusing on information processing and goal-directed action, rather than debating consciousness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of consensus on evaluating AI consciousness and moral status by shifting focus to a more practical and measurable concept of awareness.

Method: Introduces a domain-sensitive, scalable, multidimensional method for evaluating awareness profiles across diverse AI systems, emphasizing prediction of task performance.

Result: A structured approach for comparing awareness in AI systems with varying architectures and scales, facilitating assessment, design, and discourse.

Conclusion: Focusing on 'awareness' rather than consciousness provides a tractable framework for evaluating AI systems and advancing scientific and public discussions.

Abstract: Recent debates on artificial intelligence increasingly emphasise questions of AI consciousness and moral status, yet there remains little agreement on how such properties should be evaluated. In this paper, we argue that awareness offers a more productive and methodologically tractable alternative. We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse.

TL;DR: TGA, a linear-complexity model, leverages multi-behavior transitions in e-commerce to capture user intent efficiently, outperforming existing methods and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity in user interactions (e.g., clicks, purchases) provides insights into preferences, but current transformer-based models are computationally expensive for large-scale systems.

Method: TGA constructs a structured sparse graph from item, category, and neighbor-level transitions, using a transition-aware graph attention mechanism for efficient sequential modeling.

Result: TGA surpasses state-of-the-art models in performance and significantly lowers computational costs, showing real-world impact in industrial deployment.

Conclusion: TGA effectively balances accuracy and efficiency for modeling multi-behavior transitions, proving practical for large-scale applications.

Abstract: User interactions on e-commerce platforms are inherently diverse, involving behaviors such as clicking, favoriting, adding to cart, and purchasing. The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for un- derstanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi- behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional trans- formers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behav- ior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while sig- nificantly reducing computational cost. Notably, TGA has been deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, where it leads to impressive improvements in key business metrics.

Method: The authors analyze XAI methods through Barad's agential realism, critique existing approaches, and propose design directions for XAI interfaces.

Result: The paper reveals limitations in current XAI methods and suggests ethical considerations and design principles for more situated and emergent interpretations.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for a shift in XAI design to accommodate emergent interpretations, illustrated through a speculative interface case study.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is frequently positioned as a technical problem of revealing the inner workings of an AI model. This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods. We then articulate the framework's ethical dimension and propose design directions for XAI interfaces that support emergent interpretation, using a speculative text-to-music interface as a case study.

### [156] [The Responsibility Vacuum: Organizational Failure in Scaled Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15059)
*Oleg Romanchuk,Roman Bondar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Modern CI/CD pipelines with agent-generated code create a 'responsibility vacuum' where authority and understanding don't align, making accountability impossible beyond certain throughput thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the structural issue of responsibility attribution in CI/CD pipelines when human verification capacity is exceeded by automated decision generation.

Method: Analyzes CI/CD pipelines with parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and human approval gates, identifying scaling limits and dynamics like CI amplification.

Result: Beyond a throughput threshold, verification fails as a decision criterion, replaced by ritualized approval, and responsibility becomes unattainable.

Conclusion: Organizations must redesign decision boundaries or shift responsibility to batch/system levels to address the persistent issue of responsibility vacuum.

Abstract: Modern CI/CD pipelines integrating agent-generated code exhibit a structural failure in responsibility attribution. Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.
  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.
  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.
  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.
  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.

### [157] [The Why Behind the Action: Unveiling Internal Drivers via Agentic Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15075)
*Chen Qian,Peng Wang,Dongrui Liu,Junyao Yang,Dadi Guo,Ling Tang,Jilin Mei,Qihan Ren,Shuai Shao,Yong Liu,Jie Fu,Jing Shao,Xia Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework called 'general agentic attribution' to explain the reasoning behind actions of LLM-based agents, focusing on internal factors rather than just errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research mainly targets failure attribution, which is limited to explaining errors in unsuccessful actions. The authors aim to provide a broader understanding of agent behaviors, regardless of outcomes, for better accountability and governance.

Method: The proposed framework operates hierarchically: 1) At the component level, it uses temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps. 2) At the sentence level, perturbation-based analysis isolates specific textual evidence driving actions.

Result: The framework successfully identifies pivotal historical events and sentences influencing agent behavior, validated across diverse scenarios like tool use and memory-induced bias.

Conclusion: The framework enhances transparency in LLM-based agent systems, contributing to safer and more accountable deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are widely used in real-world applications such as customer service, web navigation, and software engineering. As these systems become more autonomous and are deployed at scale, understanding why an agent takes a particular action becomes increasingly important for accountability and governance. However, existing research predominantly focuses on \textit{failure attribution} to localize explicit errors in unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining the reasoning behind agent behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind the agent behavior, offering a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RISE, a 'Real-to-Virtual' method, mitigates intent deviation in LLM-based agents by synthesizing virtual trajectories and generating negative samples, improving task completion and intent alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating and improving LLM-based tool-using agents rely on costly real system samples or suffer from distribution shift with virtual data. Both lack negative samples for intent deviation scenarios.

Method: RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories anchored on verified tool primitives and generates diverse negative samples through parameter mutation. It fine-tunes LLMs via two-stage training for intent alignment.

Result: RISE improves Acctask (task completion) by 35.28% and Accintent (intent alignment) by 23.27%, outperforming SOTA baselines significantly.

Conclusion: RISE effectively addresses intent deviation in LLM-based agents, demonstrating strong performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: LLMs have advanced tool-using agents for real-world applications, yet they often lead to unexpected behaviors or results. Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of "intent deviation" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a "Real-to-Virtual" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the 'Plausibility Trap,' where AI models are misused for simple tasks, wasting resources. It introduces frameworks to guide appropriate AI usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of using LLMs for deterministic tasks, which leads to unnecessary computational costs and risks.

Method: Uses micro-benchmarks, case studies, and introduces Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix.

Result: Quantifies a ~6.5x latency penalty ('efficiency tax') and risks like algorithmic sycophancy.

Conclusion: Advocates for digital literacy reforms to teach when to avoid using generative AI, promoting resource-efficient practices.

Abstract: The ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) is driving a paradigm shift where user convenience supersedes computational efficiency. This article defines the "Plausibility Trap": a phenomenon where individuals with access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deploy expensive probabilistic engines for simple deterministic tasks-such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or basic verification-resulting in significant resource waste. Through micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking, we quantify the "efficiency tax"-demonstrating a ~6.5x latency penalty-and the risks of algorithmic sycophancy. To counter this, we introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix, a framework to help developers determine when to use Generative AI and, crucially, when to avoid it. We argue for a curriculum shift, emphasizing that true digital literacy relies not only in knowing how to use Generative AI, but also on knowing when not to use it.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel routing network embedding module and a policy gradient-based deep RL framework to maximize customer requests served within a finite time horizon in vehicle routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the vehicle routing problem with a finite time horizon, aiming to maximize customer service rates efficiently.

Method: A routing network embedding module creates local node and global graph representations, integrated into a Markov decision process and trained using deep RL.

Result: The method outperforms existing methods in customer service rates and reduces solution time significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively solves the vehicle routing problem within finite time constraints, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the vehicle routing problem with a finite time horizon. In this routing problem, the objective is to maximize the number of customer requests served within a finite time horizon. We present a novel routing network embedding module which creates local node embedding vectors and a context-aware global graph representation. The proposed Markov decision process for the vehicle routing problem incorporates the node features, the network adjacency matrix and the edge features as components of the state space. We incorporate the remaining finite time horizon into the network embedding module to provide a proper routing context to the embedding module. We integrate our embedding module with a policy gradient-based deep Reinforcement Learning framework to solve the vehicle routing problem with finite time horizon. We trained and validated our proposed routing method on real-world routing networks, as well as synthetically generated Euclidean networks. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a higher customer service rate than the existing routing methods. Additionally, the solution time of our method is significantly lower than that of the existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework embedding expert knowledge into AI agents for simulation data visualization, improving output quality by 206% and enabling non-experts to achieve expert-level results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing bottlenecks caused by limited expert availability and poor visualization quality by non-experts, the paper aims to systematize expert knowledge transfer to AI agents.

Method: A software engineering framework integrates LLM augmentation, a request classifier, RAG system, expert rules, and design principles into an autonomous AI agent.

Result: Evaluations show a 206% improvement in output quality, achieving expert-level ratings across multiple domains, with superior code quality and consistency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully captures and codifies expert knowledge, enabling non-experts to produce expert-level visualizations autonomously.

Abstract: Critical domain knowledge typically resides with few experts, creating organizational bottlenecks in scalability and decision-making. Non-experts struggle to create effective visualizations, leading to suboptimal insights and diverting expert time. This paper investigates how to capture and embed human domain knowledge into AI agent systems through an industrial case study. We propose a software engineering framework to capture human domain knowledge for engineering AI agents in simulation data visualization by augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a request classifier, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for code generation, codified expert rules, and visualization design principles unified in an agent demonstrating autonomous, reactive, proactive, and social behavior. Evaluation across five scenarios spanning multiple engineering domains with 12 evaluators demonstrates 206% improvement in output quality, with our agent achieving expert-level ratings in all cases versus baseline's poor performance, while maintaining superior code quality with lower variance. Our contributions are: an automated agent-based system for visualization generation and a validated framework for systematically capturing human domain knowledge and codifying tacit expert knowledge into AI agents, demonstrating that non-experts can achieve expert-level outcomes in specialized domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A bottom-up learning paradigm for large language models, using knowledge graphs as reward models, improves multi-hop reasoning in specialized fields, outperforming larger models like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited performance of large language models in compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields.

Method: Proposes a post-training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning and RL, with knowledge graphs providing reward signals to guide reasoning.

Result: The model outperforms larger models on complex reasoning tasks and shows robustness to adversarial tests.

Conclusion: Grounding reasoning in structured knowledge is scalable and efficient for enhancing intelligent reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved near-expert performance in structured reasoning domains like mathematics and programming, yet their ability to perform compositional multi-hop reasoning in specialized scientific fields remains limited. We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a "compositional bridge", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning.

*Shijie Lian,Bin Yu,Xiaopeng Lin,Laurence T. Yang,Zhaolong Shen,Changti Wu,Yuzhuo Miao,Cong Huang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BayesianVLA addresses the issue of 'Information Collapse' in VLA models by introducing a dual-branch architecture to enforce instruction following and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models struggle with generalization due to dataset bias where instructions become predictable from visual data alone, leading to vision-only policies.

Method: BayesianVLA uses learnable Latent Action Queries and a dual-branch architecture to estimate vision-only priors and language-conditioned posteriors, optimizing conditional PMI.

Result: The model achieves an 11.3% improvement on OOD benchmarks without requiring additional data.

Conclusion: BayesianVLA effectively grounds language in action, improving robustness and generalization in VLA models.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated pipeline to create Q&A datasets from noisy call center audio for LLM fine-tuning, demonstrating its success with Llama 2 7B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating high-quality instructional datasets from unstructured call center recordings for LLM adaptation.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline involving audio processing (diarization, noise removal, transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization), semantic extraction, and Q&A pair formation via semantic search.

Result: Successful generation of a dataset for Instruct Fine Tuning and validation through LLM fine-tuning (Llama 2 7B).

Conclusion: The approach is viable for converting unstructured call center data into training resources, enhancing AI systems for customer service Q&A tasks.

Abstract: The adaptation of Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) to specific domains depends on high-quality fine-tuning datasets, particularly in instructional format (e.g., Question-Answer - Q&A). However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: This paper explores GCG-style adversarial attacks on diffusion-based LLMs like LLaDA, evaluating their robustness compared to autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of GCG attacks on diffusion language models, which are less studied than autoregressive ones.

Method: Evaluated GCG-style attacks (prefix perturbations, suffix-based adversarial generation) on LLaDA using harmful prompts from AdvBench.

Result: Provided initial insights into the robustness and vulnerabilities of diffusion LLMs.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for alternative optimization and evaluation strategies for adversarial analysis in diffusion-based LLMs.

Abstract: While most LLMs are autoregressive, diffusion-based LLMs have recently emerged as an alternative method for generation. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks have proven effective against autoregressive models, but their applicability to diffusion language models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present an exploratory study of GCG-style adversarial prompt attacks on LLaDA (Large Language Diffusion with mAsking), an open-source diffusion LLM. We evaluate multiple attack variants, including prefix perturbations and suffix-based adversarial generation, on harmful prompts drawn from the AdvBench dataset. Our study provides initial insights into the robustness and attack surface of diffusion language models and motivates the development of alternative optimization and evaluation strategies for adversarial analysis in this setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-phase framework, DnR, to effectively integrate multimodal signals in emotion recognition by decomposing and refining unique, redundant, and synergistic components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in multimodal emotion recognition often blur the distinctions between unique, redundant, and synergistic signals, failing to balance these contributions.

Method: Proposed DnR framework: Divide phase decomposes modalities into uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy; Refine phase enhances these components with tailored objectives.

Result: Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show consistent improvements across MERC backbones, validating the approach.

Conclusion: Explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations improves emotion recognition, offering a principled strategy for future work.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) requires representations that effectively integrate signals from multiple modalities. These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \emph{unique}, \emph{redundant}, and \emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \emph{\textbf{D}ivide and \textbf{R}efine} (\textbf{DnR}). In the \textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Focuses on the need for prioritizing high-quality machine learning models over indiscriminate inclusion in distributed learning to improve cooperative prediction accuracy.

Method: Proposes the distributed error-informed GP (EIGP) framework, including selection functions, greedy (gEIGP) and adaptive (aEIGP) algorithms, and strategies for real-time learning.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art distributed GP methods via numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The EIGP framework effectively enhances prediction accuracy and efficiency in multi-agent systems by prioritizing quality models and incorporating real-time learning strategies.

Abstract: Effective cooperation is pivotal in distributed learning for multi-agent systems, where the interplay between the quantity and quality of the machine learning models is crucial. This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology, showcasing its superiority over the state-of-the-art distributed GP methods with different benchmarks.

TL;DR: A study evaluates llama.cpp quantization schemes for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, providing a guide for choosing the best scheme based on performance, memory, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization helps deploy large language models efficiently on local hardware, but inconsistent evaluations make choosing schemes difficult.

Method: The study tests 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, evaluating task performance, perplexity, CPU throughput, and model size.

Result: Quantization schemes are compared across benchmarks, perplexity, and speed, offering insights for optimal deployment.

Conclusion: This work serves as a practical guide for selecting llama.cpp quantization schemes tailored to specific needs and hardware constraints.

Abstract: Quantization is a practical technique for making large language models easier to deploy by reducing the precision used to store and operate on model weights. This can lower memory use and improve runtime feasibility on constrained hardware, which is especially relevant for users running models locally. Quantization in llama.cpp enables large language models to run on commodity hardware, but available formats are often evaluated inconsistently, making it hard to choose among schemes. We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time. Ultimately, this work is a practical guide for choosing a llama.cpp quantization scheme, helping readers make informed, context-aware decisions for their intended use and resource budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learned KV cache compression via Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP) underperforms simple baselines, suggesting limited utility of KV representations beyond position and prefill attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether learned methods can outperform simple heuristics in KV cache compression for importance prediction.

Method: Uses SIP, a 1.7M parameter scorer predicting token importance from KV representations, tested across seeds, retention levels, and tasks.

Result: SIP does not outperform baselines like random selection or position-based heuristics, indicating marginal value in KV representations.

Conclusion: Position-based heuristics and prefill attention suffice for importance prediction, questioning the need for complex learned approaches.

Abstract: We investigate learned KV cache compression through Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP), a 1.7M parameter non-query-aware scorer that predicts token importance from KV representations alone. Despite architectural sophistication (multi-horizon lookahead, cross-attention), SIP does not outperform simple baselines, including random selection, across 5 seeds, 4 retention levels, and 3 tasks. Key findings: (1) position-based heuristics (keep first 4 + last N tokens) match or exceed learned approaches; (2) prefill attention provides equivalent signal to complex learned scorers; (3) marginal information in KV representations beyond position and prefill attention appears limited for importance prediction. We hypothesize that circular dependence between future queries and generation trajectories contributes to this difficulty.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a benchmark to compare 15 models across search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning in structure-based drug design, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of each approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of cross-algorithm comparisons in structure-based drug design and evaluate performance across different algorithmic foundations.

Method: A benchmark assessing pharmaceutical properties, docking affinities, and poses of generated molecules with target proteins is used to evaluate 15 models.

Result: 3D models excel in binding affinities but lack chemical validity; 1D models perform well in molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding; 2D models offer balanced performance.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and recommendations for future SBDD model design, emphasizing the potential of combining strengths from different algorithmic approaches.

Abstract: Currently, the field of structure-based drug design is dominated by three main types of algorithms: search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning. While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

Motivation: Tree structures are common in life sciences (e.g., RNA secondary structures), necessitating efficient analytical methods due to growing biological data.

Method: Tree polynomials encode trees computationally efficiently. The study compares clustering methods using Canberra and other distances, plus autoencoder models.

Result: Entry-level normalized distance methods achieved the highest clustering accuracy among tested approaches.

Conclusion: Tree polynomials paired with specific distance metrics offer promising accuracy for tree clustering in biological data analytics.

Abstract: Tree structures appear in many fields of the life sciences, including phylogenetics, developmental biology and nucleic acid structures. Trees can be used to represent RNA secondary structures, which directly relate to the function of non-coding RNAs. Recent developments in sequencing technology and artificial intelligence have yielded numerous biological data that can be represented with tree structures. This requires novel methods for tree structure data analytics. Tree polynomials provide a computationally efficient, interpretable and comprehensive way to encode tree structures as matrices, which are compatible with most data analytics tools. Machine learning methods based on the Canberra distance between tree polynomials have been introduced to analyze phylogenies and nucleic acid structures. In this paper, we compare the performance of different distances in tree clustering methods based on a tree distinguishing polynomial. We also implement two basic autoencoder models for clustering trees using the polynomial. We find that the distance based methods with entry-level normalized distances have the highest clustering accuracy among the compared methods.

TL;DR: CoM (Chain-of-Memory) proposes lightweight memory construction paired with sophisticated utilization via dynamic inference paths, improving accuracy by 7.5%-10.4% while reducing computational costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies in existing memory systems' costly construction and ineffective retrieval-use gap for LLMs.

Method: Introduces Chain-of-Memory mechanism for coherent inference paths with adaptive truncation to filter noise.

Result: Outperforms baselines (7.5%-10.4% accuracy gains) with 2.7% token consumption and 6.0% latency of complex architectures.

Conclusion: CoM offers efficient, high-performance memory utilization for LLM agents.

Abstract: External memory systems are pivotal for enabling Large Language Model (LLM) agents to maintain persistent knowledge and perform long-horizon decision-making. Existing paradigms typically follow a two-stage process: computationally expensive memory construction (e.g., structuring data into graphs) followed by naive retrieval-augmented generation. However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization. CoM introduces a Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution, utilizing adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise. Extensive experiments on the LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks demonstrate that CoM outperforms strong baselines with accuracy gains of 7.5%-10.4%, while drastically reducing computational overhead to approximately 2.7% of token consumption and 6.0% of latency compared to complex memory architectures.

*Jun Liu,Leo Yu Zhang,Fengpeng Li,Isao Echizen,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores hard-label black-box attacks, reframing them as gradient sign recovery problems, and proposes a new attack framework with theoretical and empirical superiority over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand model behavior under hard-label black-box settings, where only top-1 predicted labels are observable, and to recover meaningful gradient information from such discrete responses.

Method: A new attack framework combining zero-query frequency-domain initialization and Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy, with theoretical guarantees on gradient sign recovery and query efficiency.

Result: Empirical validation on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet shows superior attack success rates and query efficiency, even against adversarial defenses like Blacklight.

Conclusion: The proposed method generalizes well across tasks and datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art hard-label attacks and defenses.

Abstract: Hard-label black-box settings, where only top-1 predicted labels are observable, pose a fundamentally constrained yet practically important feedback model for understanding model behavior. A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\%$ detection rate. Our code will be released publicly soon at https://github.com/csjunjun/DPAttack.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses computational inefficiency in pre-training MoE LLMs caused by underutilized experts.


Method: Introduces Layer-Adaptive Expert Pruning (LAEP) to selectively prune and reorganize experts based on token distribution.


Result: Achieves 48.3% training efficiency improvement and 33.3% parameter reduction without compromising performance.


Conclusion: LAEP enhances MoE LLM pre-training efficiency and reduces model size effectively.


Abstract: Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver superior accuracy with a reduced number of active parameters, their pre-training represents a significant computationally bottleneck due to underutilized experts and limited training efficiency. This work introduces a Layer-Adaptive Expert Pruning (LAEP) algorithm designed for the pre-training stage of MoE LLMs. In contrast to previous expert pruning approaches that operate primarily in the post-training phase, the proposed algorithm enhances training efficiency by selectively pruning underutilized experts and reorganizing experts across computing devices according to token distribution statistics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LAEP effectively reduces model size and substantially improves pre-training efficiency. In particular, when pre-training the 1010B Base model from scratch, LAEP achieves a 48.3\% improvement in training efficiency alongside a 33.3% parameter reduction, while still delivering excellent performance across multiple domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of CB algorithms in dynamic environments like fantasy sports, where rapid changes in user behavior and reward distributions require frequent retraining.

Method: Hierarchical Contextual Uplift Bandit dynamically adjusts contextual granularity and integrates uplift modeling for effective policy transfer and cold-start mitigation.

Result: Large-scale A/B testing showed 0.4% revenue improvement and better user satisfaction. Production deployment yielded an additional 0.5% revenue boost.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances recommendation quality in dynamic settings, demonstrating practical and financial benefits.

Abstract: Contextual Bandit (CB) algorithms are widely adopted for personalized recommendations but often struggle in dynamic environments typical of fantasy sports, where rapid changes in user behavior and dramatic shifts in reward distributions due to external influences necessitate frequent retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Contextual Uplift Bandit framework. Our framework dynamically adjusts contextual granularity from broad, system-wide insights to detailed, user-specific contexts, using contextual similarity to facilitate effective policy transfer and mitigate cold-start issues. Additionally, we integrate uplift modeling principles into our approach. Results from large-scale A/B testing on the Dream11 fantasy sports platform show that our method significantly enhances recommendation quality, achieving a 0.4% revenue improvement while also improving user satisfaction metrics compared to the current production system. We subsequently deployed this system to production as the default catalog personalization system in May 2025 and observed a further 0.5% revenue improvement.

*Yewon Han,Sunghyun Kim,Eunyi Jeong,Sungkyung Lee,Seokwoo Yun,Sangsoo Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiSPA is a framework for predicting drug response by modeling interactions between chemical substructures and cellular pathways, improving accuracy and interpretability over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to capture fine-grained interactions between chemical and transcriptomic modalities, limiting their ability to model drug action mechanisms effectively.

Method: DiSPA disentangles structure-driven and context-driven drug response mechanisms using bidirectional conditioning and a differential cross-attention module to suppress noise.

Result: DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GDSC benchmark, especially in generalizing to unseen drug-cell combinations, and provides mechanistically informative representations.

Conclusion: DiSPA offers a robust, interpretable framework for pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling analysis of drug response mechanisms without post hoc interpretation.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug response in precision medicine requires models that capture how specific chemical substructures interact with cellular pathway states. However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation.

TL;DR: VJEPA introduces a probabilistic approach to Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures, unifying representation learning with Bayesian filtering and enabling uncertainty-aware planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic JEPA formulations lack probabilistic semantics, limiting their use in stochastic control. VJEPA addresses this gap.

Method: VJEPA uses a variational objective to predict future latent states, avoiding autoregressive likelihoods. BJEPA extends this with modular experts.

Result: VJEPA avoids representation collapse in noisy environments and enables uncertainty estimation without pixel reconstruction.

Conclusion: VJEPA and BJEPA provide scalable, robust frameworks for uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy settings.

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a scalable paradigm for self-supervised learning by predicting latent representations rather than reconstructing high-entropy observations. However, existing formulations rely on \textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional methods like top-K or manual cutoffs for risk score processing, aiming for adaptability and efficiency under intake constraints.

Method: Fit an online adaptive kernel density to the score stream, transform it into a tail-mass curve to meet capacity, and adjust thresholds dynamically using persistent density valleys.

Result: The method achieves competitive capacity adherence and reduces threshold jitter on synthetic, drifting, multimodal streams.

Conclusion: The proposed label-free approach supports multi-queue routing and operates efficiently in real time, offering improved adaptability and stability.

Abstract: We study the problem of converting a stream of risk scores into one or more review queues under explicit intake constraints[cite: 6]. Instead of top-$K$ or manually tuned cutoffs, we fit an online adaptive kernel density to the score stream, transform the density into a tail-mass curve to meet capacity, and ``snap'' the resulting cut to a persistent density valley detected across bandwidths[cite: 7]. The procedure is label-free, supports multi-queue routing, and operates in real time with sliding windows or exponential forgetting[cite: 8]. On synthetic, drifting, multimodal streams, the method achieves competitive capacity adherence while reducing threshold jitter[cite: 9].

Result: Achieved a two-order magnitude speedup over CPU implementations on the MAX-CUT benchmark for problem sizes up to 20,000 nodes.

Conclusion: Device variability can enhance algorithm performance, and the scalable framework advances probabilistic computing research for diverse optimization applications.

Abstract: Probabilistic computing using probabilistic bits (p-bits) presents an efficient alternative to traditional CMOS logic for complex problem-solving, including simulated annealing and machine learning. Realizing p-bits with emerging devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) introduces device variability, which was expected to negatively impact computational performance. However, this study reveals an unexpected finding: device variability can not only degrade but also enhance algorithm performance, particularly by leveraging timing variability. This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated, open-source simulated annealing framework based on p-bits that models key device variability factors -timing, intensity, and offset- to reflect real-world device behavior. Through CUDA-based simulations, our approach achieves a two-order magnitude speedup over CPU implementations on the MAX-CUT benchmark with problem sizes ranging from 800 to 20,000 nodes. By providing a scalable and accessible tool, this framework aims to advance research in probabilistic computing, enabling optimization applications in diverse fields.

TL;DR: MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster, improves chaotic dynamical systems forecasting by mitigating error accumulation through multiscale latent injections and recurrent modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon forecasting in chaotic systems faces challenges like rapid error amplification and distribution shift, leading to inconsistent rollouts and statistical collapse.

Method: MSR-HINE uses coarse-to-fine recurrent states, implicit one-step predictors, and gated fusion with posterior latents for scale-consistent updates, alongside hidden-state corrections.

Result: On Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, it reduces RMSE by 62.8% and improves ACC by +0.983; on Lorenz-96, it reduces RMSE by 27.0% and improves ACC by +0.402.

Conclusion: MSR-HINE effectively extends predictability horizons and maintains accuracy in chaotic system forecasting.

Abstract: Long-horizon autoregressive forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems remains challenging due to rapid error amplification and distribution shift: small one-step inaccuracies compound into physically inconsistent rollouts and collapse of large-scale statistics. We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks a unified view of physics-aware data-driven approaches, hindering understanding of their relationships, limitations, and roles in scientific workflows.

Method: Organize existing methods into a shared design space based on what is learned, how physics is integrated, and computational amortization.

Result: Challenges in learning PDEs are clarified as consequences of these structural properties.

Conclusion: This framework aims to advance reliable learning-based PDE solvers and bridge physics with data.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to scientific modeling. Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.

TL;DR: The paper examines whether adversarial attacks effectively estimate model robustness to random noise, introducing a probabilistic metric to assess noisy risk and comparing adversarial perturbations to uniform noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if adversarial perturbations are valid proxies for robustness against random noise or if they represent atypical worst-case scenarios.

Method: Introduces a probabilistic metric for noisy risk using directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor κ. Proposes an attack strategy to align with uniform noise regimes.

Result: Benchmarks on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 reveal when adversarial attacks meaningfully reflect noisy risk and when they fall short, guiding their use in safety evaluations.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the limitations of adversarial attacks as robustness estimators and provides a framework for more accurate safety-oriented evaluations.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks are widely used to evaluate model robustness, yet their validity as proxies for robustness to random perturbations remains debated. We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic metric that quantifies noisy risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor $κ$ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial direction. Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark widely used attacks, highlighting when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented evaluation.

*Hunjae Lee,Corey Clark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses how indirect information paths (runways) in causal transformers can lead to misalignment and proposes a runway-aware rewiring method to improve attention patterns without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses observed failure modes in causal transformers caused by misalignment between direct-path attention and indirect information paths (runways).

Method: They introduce runway-aware rewiring, a mechanism that adjusts attention patterns based on runway context summaries, ensuring balanced information propagation.

Result: The proposed method improves language modeling, information retrieval, and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers.

Conclusion: Runway-aware rewiring effectively enhances transformer performance by better aligning information propagation modes.

Abstract: In decoder-only (causal) transformers, the computation graph created by causal masking routes information through both direct-path attention and indirect paths formed by intermediate tokens. We denote these indirect paths between token pairs as their runways. We argue that certain failure modes of causal transformers as observed by a growing body of recent works are likely exacerbated by a misalignment between these two information propagation modes. We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation. Our proposed methodology introduces no additional parameters and can seamlessly be integrated into standard attention mechanism. Empirically, our rewired transformer results in steady improvements in general language modeling as well as noticeably stronger information retrieval and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores whether an LLM can use task feedback to update its weights autonomously, focusing on self-supervised next token prediction and SEAL framework modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the bottleneck of frozen foundation models in open-ended search systems by enabling autonomous model updates.

Method: The research relaxed SEAL's fixed human template constraint, allowing the model to generate self-edit templates. Two variants (with/without a template archive) were tested.

Result: The archive variant outperformed weaker baselines but didn't surpass the strongest human-designed baseline. The study noted exploration collapse and potential for homogenization.

Conclusion: Autonomous updates show promise but may require novelty pressure to surpass human strategies.

Abstract: Many LLM-based open-ended search systems freeze the foundation model that proposes improvements to existing solutions, which may bottleneck long-run progress. Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker "Implications" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed "Implications" and approached the strongest human-designed "Rewrite" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces engGNN, a dual-graph framework combining external biological networks and data-driven graphs to improve predictive performance and interpretability in omics data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High dimensionality and complex networks in omics data challenge prediction and interpretation, requiring methods that integrate diverse feature relationships.

Method: engGNN uses both external biological networks (undirected) and data-driven graphs (directed) from tree-ensemble models to create comprehensive embeddings.

Result: engGNN outperforms benchmarks in simulations and real-world gene expression data, offering interpretable feature importance for biological insights.

Conclusion: engGNN is a robust, interpretable tool for disease classification and biomarker discovery in omics data.

Abstract: Omics data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, provide critical insights into disease mechanisms and clinical outcomes. However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts.

TL;DR: QMC is a retraining-free quantization method with hybrid memory architecture for efficient SLM deployment on edge platforms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in memory, energy, and latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient deployment of Small Language Models (SLMs) on resource-constrained edge platforms drives the development of QMC to address memory, latency, and energy challenges.

Method: QMC combines outlier-aware quantization with a heterogeneous memory architecture, storing inlier weights in ReRAM and outliers in MRAM, to mitigate noise and improve efficiency.

Result: QMC achieves significant improvements: 6.3x-7.3x memory reduction, 7.6x fewer external data transfers, 11.7x energy savings, and 12.5x latency reduction compared to FP16.

Conclusion: QMC is a scalable, deployment-ready co-design solution for efficient on-device inference of SLMs, outperforming existing quantization methods.

Abstract: Deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge platforms is critical for real-time, privacy-sensitive generative AI, yet constrained by memory, latency, and energy budgets. Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference.

TL;DR: Automated tagging of MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques in cybersecurity texts using hierarchical multi-label classification achieves high accuracy, outperforming GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tagging of cybersecurity texts is time-consuming; automation aims to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Stratified task space analysis and hierarchical multi-label classification models were developed.

Result: Achieved ~94% accuracy at tactic level and ~82% at technique level.

Conclusion: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and GPT-4o, offering practical tools for the security community.

Abstract: MITRE ATT&CK is a cybersecurity knowledge base that organizes threat actor and cyber-attack information into a set of tactics describing the reasons and goals threat actors have for carrying out attacks, with each tactic having a set of techniques that describe the potential methods used in these attacks. One major application of ATT&CK is the use of its tactic and technique hierarchy by security specialists as a framework for annotating cyber-threat intelligence reports, vulnerability descriptions, threat scenarios, inter alia, to facilitate downstream analyses. To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified "task space" characterization of the MITRE ATT&CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches. Moreover, we show that GPT-4o model performance at the tactic level is significantly lower (roughly 60% accuracy) than our own approach. We also extend our baseline model to a corpus of threat scenarios for financial applications produced by subject matter experts.

TL;DR: A Transformer-based framework uses reservation dynamics (ticket bookings) for accurate attendance forecasting at large events, outperforming multi-source methods by implicitly capturing external factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unreliable results from insufficient historical data in existing multi-source external data approaches for attendance forecasting at large events like Expo 2025.

Method: Proposes a Transformer-based framework leveraging reservation dynamics (ticket bookings) to implicitly capture external influences, evaluated under single- and two-channel settings.

Result: Separate modeling of East and West gates improves accuracy, especially for short- and medium-term forecasts, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: Reservation dynamics provide a practical and informative basis for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of daily attendance is vital for managing transportation, crowd flows, and services at large-scale international events such as Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan. However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module. Overall, our findings indicate that reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.1-8B generate high-quality counterfactual explanations (CFEs) for interpretable interventions and data augmentation, outperforming optimization-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability and robustness in machine learning models using CFEs for interventions and data augmentation.

Method: Evaluate CF generation using LLMs (GPT-4, BioMistral-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B) on the AI-READI dataset, assessing intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B) produce highly plausible CFs (~99% validity). CF-augmented data improves classifier performance by 20% F1 score.

Conclusion: LLM-driven CFEs excel in clinical interpretability and data efficiency, offering superior flexibility and coherence compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) provide human-centric interpretability by identifying the minimal, actionable changes required to alter a machine learning model's prediction. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CF generation using large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot) and two open-source models-BioMistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, in both pretrained and fine-tuned configurations. Using the multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset, we assess CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly LLaMA-3.1-8B, produce CFs with high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and realistic, behaviorally modifiable feature adjustments. When used for data augmentation under controlled label-scarcity settings, LLM-generated CFs substantially restore classifier performance, yielding an average 20% F1 recovery across three scarcity scenarios. Compared with optimization-based baselines such as DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, LLMs offer a flexible, model-agnostic approach that generates more clinically actionable and semantically coherent counterfactuals. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of LLM-driven counterfactuals for both interpretable intervention design and data-efficient model training in sensor-based digital health.
  Impact: SenseCF fine-tunes an LLM to generate valid, representative counterfactual explanations and supplement minority class in an imbalanced dataset for improving model training and boosting model robustness and predictive performance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistent claims and a lack of understanding about the roles and bottlenecks of optimizing choices in reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs.

Method: A bottom-up experiment pipeline starting with a minimalist configuration and expanding layer by layer to examine each design choice, supported by multi-armed bandit learning theory.

Result: Reveals new insights into design choices and provides essential understanding to guide the field, tested on three LLMs and two reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: The study offers clarity on optimizing choices in reinforcement fine-tuning and shapes future research in the area.

Abstract: A large number of heuristics have been proposed to optimize the reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs. However, inconsistent claims are made from time to time, making this area elusive. Reflecting on this situation, two fundamental questions still lack a clear understanding: 1) what is the role of each optimizing choice? 2) which ones are the bottlenecks? This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings. The up procedure of the experiment pipeline expanding the minimalist configuration layer by layer, examining the role of each design choice. Experimental results on three LLMs and two reasoning datasets not only reveal new understanding of the design choice but also yield essential insights to shape the area.

TL;DR: Muon accelerates LLM pretraining with orthogonal momentum updates, introducing variants Muon-NSR and Muon-VS for improved efficiency over AdamW and Muon baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizer efficiency is crucial due to the high computational demands of LLM pretraining.

Method: Proposes Muon-NSR (noise-to-signal ratio modulation) and Muon-VS (variance-based scaling) as variants of Muon, applying variance-adaptive normalization.

Result: Demonstrates faster convergence and lower validation loss compared to AdamW and Muon baselines, achieving a 1.36× reduction in iterations for LLaMA-1.2B.

Conclusion: Muon-NSR and Muon-VS are effective optimizers for LLM pretraining, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve competitive performance across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet pretraining is computationally demanding, making optimizer efficiency an important practical consideration. Muon accelerates LLM pretraining via orthogonal momentum updates that serve as a matrix analogue of the element-wise sign operator. Motivated by the recent perspective that Adam is a variance-adaptive sign update algorithm, we propose two variants of Muon, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS, which apply variance-adaptive normalization to momentum before orthogonalization. Muon-NSR applies noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) modulation, while Muon-VS performs variance-based scaling without introducing additional hyperparameters. Experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining demonstrate that our proposed methods accelerate convergence and consistently achieve lower validation loss than both competitive, well-tuned AdamW and Muon baselines. For example, on the LLaMA-1.2B model, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS reduce the iterations required to reach the target validation loss by $1.36\times$ relative to the well-tuned Muon following the recent benchmark.

*Yvonne Yang,Eranki Vasistha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) to improve credit default risk prediction by capturing cross-entity dependencies in financial data, finding that hybrid models combining GNN embeddings with tabular features outperform standalone methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tabular models struggle to capture complex cross-entity dependencies in financial data, prompting the exploration of heterogeneous GNNs.

Method: Constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph with 31M nodes and 50M edges, and evaluated GNNs like GraphSAGE and a relation-aware GNN against tabular baselines.

Result: Hybrid ensembles combining GNN embeddings with tabular features outperformed standalone GNNs, improving ROC-AUC and PR-AUC.

Conclusion: Incorporating relational signals via GNNs can enhance credit scoring, though hybrid approaches and careful fairness analyses are key.

Abstract: Credit default risk arises from complex interactions among borrowers, financial institutions, and transaction-level behaviors. While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories.
  We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Finally, we conduct structured explainability and fairness analyses to characterize how relational signals affect subgroup behavior and screening-oriented outcomes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of missing data in single-cell sequencing datasets, especially cases with large patches of missing data, which existing imputation methods fail to handle adequately.

In this paper, we present CROT, an optimal transport-based imputation algorithm designed to handle patch-based missing data in tabular formats. Our approach effectively captures the underlying data structure in the presence of significant missingness. Notably, it achieves superior imputation accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for large-scale datasets.

*Zhihao Chen,Zirui Gong,Jianting Ning,Yanjun Zhang,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Rank Learning (FRL) enhances robustness against model poisoning attacks via discrete rankings but remains vulnerable to fine-grained control attacks like ECA, which precisely degrades accuracy while avoiding detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for secure and private FL frameworks motivates FRL's development, but its vulnerability to advanced attacks like ECA necessitates stronger defenses.

Method: FRL uses discrete rankings for updates, reducing communication costs and attack surfaces, while ECA exploits edges and selection boundaries for precise accuracy control.

Result: ECA achieves fine-grained control with minimal error (0.224%), outperforming baselines by up to 17x across multiple datasets and aggregation rules.

Conclusion: FRL improves robustness but requires enhanced defenses against sophisticated attacks like ECA.

Abstract: Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets and nine Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) show that ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with an average error of only 0.224%, outperforming the baseline by up to 17x. Our findings highlight the need for stronger defenses against advanced poisoning attacks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Chenzh0205/ECA

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EGRL-SR introduces reinforcement learning with historical trajectories and a binary reward function to improve symbolic regression by focusing on structural patterns over fitting error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ambiguity in search directions caused by similar error values among diverse expressions in symbolic regression.

Method: Formulates symbolic regression as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, uses hindsight experience replay, and designs a binary reward function and exploration strategy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, recovering more complex expressions efficiently.

Conclusion: EGRL-SR's reinforcement learning approach, reward function, and exploration strategy effectively guide search and improve performance.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to automatically identify compact and interpretable mathematical expressions that model the functional relationship between input and output variables. Most existing search-based symbolic regression methods typically rely on the fitting error to inform the search process. However, in the vast expression space, numerous candidate expressions may exhibit similar error values while differing substantially in structure, leading to ambiguous search directions and hindering convergence to the underlying true function. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph unlearning methods lack clarity on key effectiveness factors, leading to impractical assessments, ineffectiveness on hard tasks, and misaligned evaluations.

Method: MGU introduces memorization-guided assessment, adaptive strategies, and comprehensive evaluation protocols to enhance unlearning effectiveness.

Result: MGU outperforms baselines in forgetting quality, efficiency, and utility preservation across ten real-world graphs.

Conclusion: MGU provides a practical and effective solution for graph unlearning, advancing the field significantly.

Abstract: Graph unlearning (GU), which removes nodes, edges, or features from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial in Web applications where graph data may contain sensitive, mislabeled, or malicious information. However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.

Motivation: Current post-training scaling strategies struggle with instability and unpredictability, especially on hard problems or weak foundation models.

Method: CoScale-RL scales up solutions by collecting multiple solutions per problem and uses scaled rollout computation to stabilize Reinforcement Learning. It also employs Re-distillation for computational efficiency.

Result: The method achieves an average 3.76× accuracy improvement on four benchmarks and enhances LRM's reasoning ability without extensive SFT datasets.

Conclusion: CoScale-RL provides a new direction for improving LRM's reasoning ability through efficient scaling strategies.

Abstract: Training Large Reasoning Model (LRM) is usually unstable and unpredictable, especially on hard problems or weak foundation models. We found that the current post-training scaling strategy can still improve on these cases. We propose CoScale-RL, a novel scaling strategy with better data and computational efficiency. We first scale up solutions to make problems solvable. The core idea is to collect multiple solutions for each problem, rather than simply enlarging the dataset. Then, we scale up rollout computation to stabilize Reinforcement Learning. We further leverage a model merge technique called Re-distillation to sustain or even improve computational efficiency when scaling up. Our method significantly improves data and computational efficiency, with an average 3.76$\times$ accuracy improvement on four benchmarks. CoScale-RL is able to improve an LRM's ability boundary without an extensive SFT dataset. Our method provides a new scaling direction to further improve LRM's reasoning ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug discovery requires efficient experimental sequencing under severe uncertainty and resource constraints, but lacks explicit simulators or transition data.

Method: IBMDP constructs an implicit Bayesian model using historical outcomes, enabling belief updates and ensemble MCTS planning for stable, resource-efficient policies.

Result: IBMDP reduces resource consumption by up to 92% in CNS drug discovery and aligns better with optimal policies in synthetic benchmarks than deterministic alternatives.

Conclusion: IBMDP provides a practical, effective approach for sequential experimental design in data-rich, simulator-poor domains.

Abstract: Optimally sequencing experimental assays in drug discovery is a high-stakes planning problem under severe uncertainty and resource constraints. A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner. IBMDP offers a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains.

TL;DR: FSX is a novel hybrid framework combining internal message flows and cooperative game theory to explain GNN predictions efficiently and accurately, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between computational efficiency and capturing structural interactions in explaining GNN predictions.

Method: FSX uses flow-sensitivity analysis to identify critical message flows, then applies a flow-aware cooperative game to evaluate node contributions.

Result: FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with reduced runtime and provides insights into structural logic.

Conclusion: FSX offers an efficient and accurate solution for understanding GNN predictions by integrating message flows and cooperative games.

Abstract: Despite the widespread success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), understanding the reasons behind their specific predictions remains challenging. Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.

*Hongyue Wu,Hangyu Li,Guodong Fan,Haoran Zhu,Shizhan Chen,Zhiyong Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RefProtoFL is a federated learning framework that improves communication efficiency and representation consistency using prototype alignment and adaptive update dropping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges like limited bandwidth and data heterogeneity. Existing prototype-based methods struggle with generalization under severe communication constraints.

Method: RefProtoFL splits the model into private and shared parts, uses adaptive probabilistic update dropping for communication efficiency, and aligns prototypes using a small public dataset.

Result: The framework achieves higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art prototype-based FL baselines.

Conclusion: RefProtoFL effectively addresses communication and representation challenges in federated learning, enhancing performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data in edge environments, but is constrained by limited communication bandwidth and heterogeneous client data distributions. Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RefProtoFL attains higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art prototype-based FL baselines.

### [203] [Mechanism Shift During Post-training from Autoregressive to Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14758)
*Injin Kong,Hyoungjoon Lee,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-training ARMs into MDMs shows a fundamental shift in computational mechanisms, diverging from autoregressive heuristics to support global planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether post-trained MDMs gain true bidirectional reasoning or just reuse autoregressive methods.

Method: Comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and MDMs to examine structural and semantic changes.

Result: MDMs retain autoregressive circuitry for local tasks but rewire for global planning, shifting from localized to distributed processing.

Conclusion: Diffusion post-training reorganizes internal computation, enabling non-sequential global planning.

Abstract: Post-training pretrained Autoregressive models (ARMs) into Masked Diffusion models (MDMs) has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to overcome the limitations of sequential generation. However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic "mechanism shift" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.

### [204] [Anytime Optimal Decision Tree Learning with Continuous Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14765)
*Harold Kiossou,Pierre Schaus,Siegfried Nijssen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of extending optimal decision tree algorithms to continuous features, proposing an anytime, complete approach to improve solution quality at any interruption point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exact algorithms for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features suffer from poor anytime behavior due to a depth-first search strategy, yielding suboptimal solutions when interrupted early.

Method: The proposed solution leverages limited discrepancy search to distribute computational effort evenly across the tree structure, ensuring better-quality trees at any interruption point.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the new approach outperforms the existing method in terms of anytime performance.

Conclusion: The proposed anytime, complete method effectively addresses the limitations of depth-first search strategies, providing more balanced and higher-quality decision trees under time constraints.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made on algorithms for learning optimal decision trees, primarily in the context of binary features. Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing one in terms of anytime performance.

TL;DR: MoE models outperform dense networks by filtering noise and improving robustness and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Mixture of Experts (MoE) models surpass dense networks beyond just parameter count.

Method: Studied MoEs in an iso-parameter regime with latent modular inputs corrupted by feature noise.

Result: MoEs showed lower generalization error, better robustness to perturbations, and faster convergence.

Conclusion: Sparse expert activation in MoEs acts as a noise filter, enhancing robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite their practical success, it remains unclear why Mixture of Experts (MoE) models can outperform dense networks beyond sheer parameter scaling. We study an iso-parameter regime where inputs exhibit latent modular structure but are corrupted by feature noise, a proxy for noisy internal activations. We show that sparse expert activation acts as a noise filter: compared to a dense estimator, MoEs achieve lower generalization error under feature noise, improved robustness to perturbations, and faster convergence speed. Empirical results on synthetic data and real-world language tasks corroborate the theoretical insights, demonstrating consistent robustness and efficiency gains from sparse modular computation.

*Ondřej Holub,Essi Ryymin,Rodrigo Alves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-agent framework for generating reflection questions using LLMs, showing improved quality over one-shot methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating the creation of pedagogically effective reflection questions to save teacher time and ensure consistency.

Method: Uses a Socratic dialogue between Student-Teacher and Teacher-Educator agents to iteratively refine questions, evaluated with GPT-4-class models.

Result: Dynamic stopping with context outperforms fixed iterations; two-agent protocol yields more relevant, deeper, and higher-quality questions.

Conclusion: The reflection-in-reflection framework enhances question generation, offering a scalable tool for educators.

Abstract: Designing good reflection questions is pedagogically important but time-consuming and unevenly supported across teachers. This paper introduces a reflection-in-reflection framework for automated generation of reflection questions with large language models (LLMs). Our approach coordinates two role-specialized agents, a Student-Teacher and a Teacher-Educator, that engage in a Socratic multi-turn dialogue to iteratively refine a single question given a teacher-specified topic, key concepts, student level, and optional instructional materials. The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue. We evaluate the framework in an authentic lower-secondary ICT setting on the topic, using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone model and a stronger GPT- 4-class LLM as an external evaluator in pairwise comparisons of clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality. First, we study how interaction design and context (dynamic vs.fixed iteration counts; presence or absence of student level and materials) affect question quality. Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication. Second, we show that our two-agent protocol produces questions that are judged substantially more relevant and deeper, and better overall, than a one-shot baseline using the same backbone model.

*Christian Fiedler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes kernel-based learning methods for supervised learning with distributional inputs, focusing on SVMs for classification, and provides theoretical results including oracle inequalities, consistency, and learning rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from applications like medical screening or causal learning where inputs are probability distributions only accessible via samples, necessitating theoretical analysis of kernel-based methods like SVMs.

Method: The method involves embedding distributions or samples into a Hilbert space using kernel mean embeddings (KMEs) and applying SVMs with kernels defined on this space, focusing on hinge loss and Gaussian kernels.

Result: The paper establishes new oracle inequalities, consistency, and learning rate results for SVMs with distributional inputs. A novel noise assumption variant is introduced to derive learning rates.

Conclusion: The study advances the theoretical understanding of kernel-based methods for distributional inputs, with tools like a new feature space for Gaussian kernels being of broader interest.

Abstract: In supervised learning with distributional inputs in the two-stage sampling setup, relevant to applications like learning-based medical screening or causal learning, the inputs (which are probability distributions) are not accessible in the learning phase, but only samples thereof. This problem is particularly amenable to kernel-based learning methods, where the distributions or samples are first embedded into a Hilbert space, often using kernel mean embeddings (KMEs), and then a standard kernel method like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is applied, using a kernel defined on the embedding Hilbert space. In this work, we contribute to the theoretical analysis of this latter approach, with a particular focus on classification with distributional inputs using SVMs. We establish a new oracle inequality and derive consistency and learning rate results. Furthermore, for SVMs using the hinge loss and Gaussian kernels, we formulate a novel variant of an established noise assumption from the binary classification literature, under which we can establish learning rates. Finally, some of our technical tools like a new feature space for Gaussian kernels on Hilbert spaces are of independent interest.

TL;DR: The paper studies vehicle behavior prediction in highway on/off-ramps using multi-layered LSTM and ExiD drone data, showing promising accuracy up to 4 seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On/off-ramps introduce uncertainty in highway interactions, and predicting vehicle behavior here can improve road safety.

Method: Uses a multi-layered LSTM architecture trained on the ExiD drone dataset, testing different prediction horizons and workflows.

Result: Achieved 76% accuracy for on/off-ramps and 94% for general highway scenarios at a 4-second horizon.

Conclusion: The approach shows potential for enhancing safety in complex highway sections like on/off-ramps.

Abstract: On and off-ramps are understudied road sections even though they introduce a higher level of variation in highway interactions. Predicting vehicles' behavior in these areas can decrease the impact of uncertainty and increase road safety. In this paper, the difference between this Area of Interest (AoI) and a straight highway section is studied. Multi-layered LSTM architecture to train the AoI model with ExiD drone dataset is utilized. In the process, different prediction horizons and different models' workflow are tested. The results show great promise on horizons up to 4 seconds with prediction accuracy starting from about 76% for the AoI and 94% for the general highway scenarios on the maximum horizon.

*Baojun Che,Yifan Chen,Daniel Zhengyu Huang,Xinying Mao,Weijie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A stable and efficient framework for black-box variational inference (BBVI) using Gaussian mixture families is proposed, combining affine-invariant preconditioning, an exponential integrator, and adaptive time stepping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard numerical optimization methods for BBVI with Gaussian mixtures often face instability and inefficiency, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: The framework integrates three components: affine-invariant preconditioning via natural gradient formulations, an exponential integrator preserving covariance matrix positivity, and adaptive time stepping for stability.

Result: Proven exponential convergence for Gaussian posteriors and demonstrated effectiveness on multimodal distributions, Neal's funnel, and a PDE-based inverse problem.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a stable and efficient solution for BBVI, validated by theoretical guarantees and numerical experiments.

Abstract: Black-box variational inference (BBVI) with Gaussian mixture families offers a flexible approach for approximating complex posterior distributions without requiring gradients of the target density. However, standard numerical optimization methods often suffer from instability and inefficiency. We develop a stable and efficient framework that combines three key components: (1) affine-invariant preconditioning via natural gradient formulations, (2) an exponential integrator that unconditionally preserves the positive definiteness of covariance matrices, and (3) adaptive time stepping to ensure stability and to accommodate distinct warm-up and convergence phases. The proposed approach has natural connections to manifold optimization and mirror descent. For Gaussian posteriors, we prove exponential convergence in the noise-free setting and almost-sure convergence under Monte Carlo estimation, rigorously justifying the necessity of adaptive time stepping. Numerical experiments on multimodal distributions, Neal's multiscale funnel, and a PDE-based Bayesian inverse problem for Darcy flow demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve strategic reasoning by addressing doctrinal consistency and uncertainty calibration in multi-document analysis, enhancing long-horizon forecasting and plan plausibility.

Method: Combines multi-document attention, temporal encoding, and a doctrine-consistency layer to ensure doctrinal adherence and improve forecasting accuracy.

Result: sdLM outperforms general-purpose LLM baselines in strategic quality and calibration, and matches human experts in long-horizon judgments. Evaluations include expert-panel scoring, doctrine consistency, and geopolitical forecasting.

Conclusion: sdLM is effective for strategic reasoning, offering improvements over existing models and competitive performance with human experts, with practical applications in operational settings.

Abstract: We introduce Strategic Doctrine Language Models (sdLM), a learning-system framework for multi-document strategic reasoning with doctrinal consistency constraints and calibrated uncertainty. The approach combines multi-document attention, temporal encoding, and a doctrine-consistency layer to improve long-horizon forecasting and plan plausibility while reducing severe doctrinal violations. We evaluate sdLM using (i) expert-panel scoring of strategic scenarios (N=47), (ii) doctrine consistency on 336 doctrine publications (12,847 statements), and (iii) geopolitical forecasting on 127 historical counterfactuals (1945-2020) across 12-60 month horizons. Across these benchmarks, sdLM achieves higher strategic quality and better calibration than strong general-purpose LLM baselines, and remains competitive with human experts on long-horizon judgments. We further report ablations, scaling trends, and deployment-oriented performance/latency characteristics to clarify which components drive improvements and how they translate to operational settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reasoning-QAT, a workflow combining quantization-aware training (QAT) and knowledge distillation to enhance efficiency and accuracy in reasoning models, outperforming traditional PTQ methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving inference efficiency in reasoning models without significant accuracy drops, especially under low-bit quantization settings.

Method: Combines quantization-aware training (QAT) with knowledge distillation, leveraging PTQ initialization and reinforcement learning feasibility.

Result: Reasoning-QAT outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods, e.g., surpassing GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 for Qwen3-0.6B.

Conclusion: The optimized QAT workflow effectively balances efficiency and accuracy for reasoning models across diverse datasets and backbones.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel at complex tasks such as coding and mathematics, yet their inference is often slow and token-inefficient. To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. For instance, on Qwen3-0.6B, it surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and consistently recovers performance in the 2-bit regime.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective Type 1 Diabetes management requires precise glucose monitoring and insulin adjustments. Wearable glucose monitors and mobile health apps necessitate accurate predictions for automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems.

Conclusion: Personalized glucose prediction models advance diabetes management, especially in wearable and mobile health platforms, highlighting their potential for consumer-oriented care solutions.

Abstract: Effective management of Type 1 Diabetes requires continuous glucose monitoring and precise insulin adjustments to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. With the growing adoption of wearable glucose monitors and mobile health applications, accurate blood glucose prediction is essential for enhancing automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for personalized blood glucose prediction, leveraging patient-specific data to improve prediction accuracy and responsiveness in real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios. To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging. Our findings underscore the potential of adaptive, personalized glucose prediction models for advancing next-generation diabetes management, particularly in wearable and mobile health platforms, enhancing consumer-oriented diabetes care solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework improves efficiency and robustness for multi-modal edge inference over wireless links.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of high communication overhead and robustness issues in multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) due to bandwidth limitations and noisy inputs.

Method: Proposes a three-stage framework: local self-supervised learning, distributed fine-tuning with evidential fusion, and uncertainty-guided feedback for selective feature requests.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy with fewer communication rounds and remains robust to degraded modalities or varying channels, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances communication efficiency and robustness for MMEI, validated by experiments on indoor scene classification.

Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as a key enabler for distributed edge intelligence due to its capability to convey task-relevant meaning. However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal rumor detection model combining visual and text encoders, forgery features, and external evidence to improve detection of deep semantic mismatch rumors in social media posts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rumors exploit inconsistencies in mixed image-text posts, making detection challenging. Existing methods lack robust feature extraction, alignment, and external evidence integration.

Method: Uses ResNet34 and BERT encoders, forgery features (frequency-domain traces, compression artifacts), BLIP-generated descriptions, dual contrastive learning, and gated adaptive fusion.

Result: Outperforms baselines on Weibo and Twitter datasets in macro accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

Conclusion: The model effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating external evidence and forgery features, improving rumor detection.

Abstract: Social media increasingly disseminates information through mixed image text posts, but rumors often exploit subtle inconsistencies and forged content, making detection based solely on post content difficult. Deep semantic mismatch rumors, which superficially align images and texts, pose particular challenges and threaten online public opinion. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods improve cross modal modeling but suffer from limited feature extraction, noisy alignment, and inflexible fusion strategies, while ignoring external factual evidence necessary for verifying complex rumors. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model enhanced with external evidence and forgery features. The model uses a ResNet34 visual encoder, a BERT text encoder, and a forgery feature module extracting frequency-domain traces and compression artifacts via Fourier transformation. BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces. A dual contrastive learning module computes contrastive losses between text image and text description pairs, improving detection of semantic inconsistencies. A gated adaptive feature-scaling fusion mechanism dynamically adjusts multimodal fusion and reduces redundancy. Experiments on Weibo and Twitter datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms mainstream baselines in macro accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

TL;DR: DEGen improves UED by enhancing reward signals and introducing MNA for better challenge identification, outperforming current methods as environment size grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving generalization and zero-shot performance in RL by addressing credit assignment and regret approximation challenges in UED.

Method: Proposes DEGen for denser reward signals and MNA as a superior regret approximation to identify challenging levels.

Result: DEGen with MNA outperforms existing methods, especially in larger environments, validated empirically.

Conclusion: DEGen and MNA advance UED by effectively scaling to larger environments and better identifying challenging levels.

Abstract: Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) seeks to automatically generate training curricula for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, with the goal of improving generalisation and zero-shot performance. However, designing effective curricula remains a difficult problem, particularly in settings where small subsets of environment parameterisations result in significant increases in the complexity of the required policy. Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes. We also introduce a new regret approximation, Maximised Negative Advantage (MNA), as a significantly improved metric to optimise for, that better identifies more challenging levels. We show empirically that MNA outperforms current regret approximations and when combined with DEGen, consistently outperforms existing methods, especially as the size of the environment grows. We have made all our code available here: https://github.com/HarryMJMead/Dynamic-Environment-Generation-for-UED.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InstructTime++ reformulates time series classification as a generative task using multimodal inputs and outputs, outperforming existing methods by leveraging discretization, alignment, and implicit feature modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discriminative methods struggle with contextual features and semantic class relationships.

Method: Proposes InstructTime++ with multimodal inputs (numerical sequences, text, instructions), discretization, alignment layers, and implicit feature modeling.

Result: Superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Generative approach with multimodal inputs and implicit feature modeling enhances time series classification.

Abstract: Most existing time series classification methods adopt a discriminative paradigm that maps input sequences directly to one-hot encoded class labels. While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of InstructTime++.

TL;DR: FG-Trac is a framework providing verifiable, sample-level traceability in machine learning pipelines without altering models or training objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transparency mechanisms lack sample-level traceability, leaving practitioners unable to track individual data samples' usage and integrity.

Method: FG-Trac captures and verifies sample lifecycle events, computes contribution scores from training checkpoints, and uses cryptographic commitments.

Result: Experiments show FG-Trac maintains predictive performance while offering auditable data-usage histories with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: FG-Trac enhances transparency in ML pipelines by enabling verifiable evidence of sample usage, addressing gaps in existing mechanisms.

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems are increasingly realised as multistage pipelines, yet existing transparency mechanisms typically operate at a model level: they describe what a system is and why it behaves as it does, but not how individual data samples are operationally recorded, tracked, and verified as they traverse the pipeline. This absence of verifiable, sample-level traceability leaves practitioners and users unable to determine whether a specific sample was used, when it was processed, or whether the corresponding records remain intact over time. We introduce FG-Trac, a model-agnostic framework that establishes verifiable, fine-grained sample-level traceability throughout machine learning pipelines. FG-Trac defines an explicit mechanism for capturing and verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, computes contribution scores explicitly grounded in training checkpoints, and anchors these traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. The framework integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives, reconstructing complete and auditable data-usage histories with practical computational overhead. Experiments on a canonical convolutional neural network and a multimodal graph learning pipeline demonstrate that FG-Trac preserves predictive performance while enabling machine learning systems to furnish verifiable evidence of how individual samples were used and propagated during model execution.

*Christos Petridis,Konstantinos Pelechrinis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper proposes L-RAPM, a regression-based method to evaluate basketball lineups, addressing data sparsity and noise by considering opposition and player information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lineup evaluation methods suffer from noisy, sparse data due to frequent substitutions, lacking reliable predictive power.

Method: Uses regression-based L-RAPM to account for opposition and player composition, improving lineup performance prediction.

Result: L-RAPM outperforms baseline methods, especially with smaller lineup sample sizes.

Conclusion: L-RAPM offers a more reliable way to assess lineup performance despite data sparsity.

Abstract: Identifying combinations of players (that is, lineups) in basketball - and other sports - that perform well when they play together is one of the most important tasks in sports analytics. One of the main challenges associated with this task is the frequent substitutions that occur during a game, which results in highly sparse data. In particular, a National Basketball Association (NBA) team will use more than 600 lineups during a season, which translates to an average lineup having seen the court in approximately 25-30 possessions. Inevitably, any statistics that one collects for these lineups are going to be noisy, with low predictive value. Yet, there is no existing work (in the public at least) that addresses this problem. In this work, we propose a regression-based approach that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup, while it also utilizes information about the players making up the lineups. Our experiments show that L-RAPM provides improved predictive power than the currently used baseline, and this improvement increases as the sample size for the lineups gets smaller.

*Michael Feil,Julius Lipp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RadixMLP eliminates redundancy in batch inference workloads for causal transformer models by compressing shared prefixes and optimizing computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference engines inefficiently recompute identical MLP activations for shared prefixes in sequences, leading to redundancy.

Method: RadixMLP dynamically maps batches to a prefix trie, compressing shared segments for position-wise computation and scattering results at attention boundaries.

Result: RadixMLP achieves 1.44-1.59× speedups in reranking workloads on MS MARCO v1.1 and up to 5× speedups on synthetic benchmarks with longer shared prefixes.

Conclusion: RadixMLP is an efficient, stateless technique that significantly reduces redundancy and improves speed in transformer model inference.

Abstract: Batch inference workloads for causal transformer models frequently process sequences that share common prefixes, such as system prompts, few-shot examples, or shared queries. Standard inference engines treat each sequence independently, redundantly recomputing identical MLP activations for every copy of the shared prefix. We introduce RadixMLP, a technique that exploits the position-wise nature of MLPs, LayerNorms, linear projections, and embeddings to eliminate this redundancy. RadixMLP dynamically maps batches to a prefix trie, gathering shared segments into a compressed representation for position-wise computation and scattering results back only at attention boundaries. RadixMLP is stateless and operates within a single forward pass. In end-to-end serving benchmarks on MS~MARCO v1.1 with Qwen3 models (0.6B to 8B parameters), RadixMLP achieves 1.44-1.59$\times$ speedups in realistic reranking workloads, with up to $5\times$ speedups on synthetic benchmarks with longer shared prefixes.

TL;DR: FluidGym is introduced as a fully differentiable, standalone benchmark suite for RL in AFC, addressing limitations of current benchmarks by eliminating external CFD dependencies and offering standardized evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches in AFC suffer from inconsistent setups and reliance on external CFD solvers, hindering progress assessment and scalability.

Method: FluidGym is built in PyTorch using the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, providing a unified Python stack without external CFD software. Baseline results use PPO and SAC.

Result: FluidGym offers a scalable, differentiable benchmark with standardized protocols, enabling systematic method comparison.

Conclusion: FluidGym facilitates future AFC research by providing a standalone, fully differentiable tool with public resources.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in active flow control (AFC), yet progress in the field remains difficult to assess as existing studies rely on heterogeneous observation and actuation schemes, numerical setups, and evaluation protocols. Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in a single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols. We present baseline results with PPO and SAC and release all environments, datasets, and trained models as public resources. FluidGym enables systematic comparison of control methods, establishes a scalable foundation for future research in learning-based flow control, and is available at https://github.com/safe-autonomous-systems/fluidgym.

*Adam Rokah,Daniel Veress,Caleb Caulk,Sourav Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores MoE architectures in image classification, comparing dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE variants on CIFAR10. MoE models slightly outperform dense baselines with balanced expert use. Sharpness metrics reveal differences in curvature, though generalization remains comparable. Conditional routing lacks inference speedups at this scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study MoE behavior in image classification, assessing predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization, contrasting theoretical efficiency with practical outcomes.

Method: Compared dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on CIFAR10 under equal model capacity, using Hessian-based sharpness metrics and loss surface perturbations for analysis.

Result: MoE variants achieve marginally higher accuracy than dense models without expert collapse. SoftMoE shows higher sharpness, but all models generalize similarly. Conditional routing offers no inference speedups.

Conclusion: MoEs enhance performance modestly in image classification but face practical efficiency gaps. Sharpness metrics and loss perturbations reveal nuanced differences without explaining generalization fully.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enable conditional computation by routing inputs to multiple expert subnetworks and are often motivated as a mechanism for scaling large language models. In this project, we instead study MoE behavior in an image classification setting, focusing on predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization. We compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on the CIFAR10 dataset under comparable model capacity. Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.

### [222] [A Curriculum-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15038)
*Mertcan Daysalilar,Fuat Uyguroglu,Gabriel Nicolosi,Adam Meyers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework for EVRPTW, achieving stable training and strong generalization on diverse problem sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL models struggle with training stability and generalization in dense constraint scenarios like EVRPTW.

Method: A three-phase curriculum gradually introduces complexity (distance/fleet, battery, full problem) with a modified PPO algorithm and specialized policy network.

Result: The model generalizes well to unseen instances (N=5 to N=100), outperforming baselines, especially on medium-scale problems.

Conclusion: CB-DRL bridges the gap between neural speed and reliability, maintaining high feasibility and solution quality.

Abstract: The electric vehicle routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW) is a complex optimization problem in sustainable logistics, where routing decisions must minimize total travel distance, fleet size, and battery usage while satisfying strict customer time constraints. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyNeA is a generative testing method using hypernetworks for efficient control over diffusion models, enabling targeted generation of realistic failure cases without needing failure-labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adversarial attacks assess robustness but lack realism, while existing generative methods are limited in scalability or controllability. HyNeA addresses these gaps.

Method: HyNeA employs hypernetworks for dataset-free controllability and instance-level tuning to generate failure-inducing test cases efficiently.

Result: HyNeA improves controllability, test diversity, and generalizes to domains without failure-labeled data, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: HyNeA offers a scalable and efficient solution for generating realistic failure cases, advancing deep learning system evaluation.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoRAP, a method using prompt learning to improve quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs, addressing limitations in quantized aggregation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs by optimizing quantized aggregations through prompt learning.

Method: Proposes Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), injecting lightweight, input-dependent prompts into aggregated features.

Result: LoRAP consistently improves performance across 9 datasets and 4 QAT frameworks with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: LoRAP effectively enhances quantized GNNs by optimizing aggregation results through prompt learning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks that aim to process graph data, capturing the relationships and interactions between nodes using the message-passing mechanism. GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.

*Oleg Shchendrigin,Egor Cherepanov,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark to test memory rewriting in RL, revealing recurrent models outperform modern architectures in adaptability, highlighting the need for balanced memory mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world decision-making requires memory systems that are stable yet adaptive, but current RL benchmarks and agents focus mainly on retention, neglecting memory rewriting.

Method: A benchmark is developed to evaluate continual memory updating under partial observability, comparing recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures.

Result: Recurrent models show superior flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks, while structured memories and transformers perform poorly beyond simple retention.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for memory mechanisms that combine stable retention with adaptive updating, paving the way for future RL agents with trainable forgetting.

Abstract: Effective decision-making in the real world depends on memory that is both stable and adaptive: environments change over time, and agents must retain relevant information over long horizons while also updating or overwriting outdated content when circumstances shift. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

TL;DR: The Field-Space Autoencoder is a scalable climate emulation framework that compresses spherical climate data efficiently, preserves physical structures better than baselines, and enables downstream generative tasks like zero-shot super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are computationally expensive and produce large outputs, limiting their use for probabilistic risk assessment. The Field-Space Autoencoder addresses these challenges.

Method: Utilizes Field-Space Attention to operate on native climate model output, avoiding geometric distortions. Produces structured compressed fields for downstream generative tasks and zero-shot super-resolution.

Result: Preserves physical structures better than convolutional baselines and bridges low-resolution ensemble statistics with high-resolution physical detail.

Conclusion: The framework effectively compresses climate data, enabling efficient generative emulation and super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are essential for capturing local climate change. However, these models are computationally expensive and produce petabyte-scale outputs, which limits their utility for applications such as probabilistic risk assessment. Here, we present the Field-Space Autoencoder, a scalable climate emulation framework based on a spherical compression model that overcomes these challenges. By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data. Our work bridges the gap between the high volume of low-resolution ensemble statistics and the scarcity of high-resolution physical detail.

### [227] [Auditing Language Model Unlearning via Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15111)
*Anmol Goel,Alan Ritter,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current machine unlearning methods in language models fail to completely erase forgotten data, as residual knowledge remains decodable. An information-theoretic framework (PID) reveals and quantifies this issue, enabling practical solutions like a risk score to prevent privacy leaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in assessing machine unlearning effectiveness, particularly the persistence of residual knowledge in language models despite unlearning efforts.

Method: Introduces an interpretable framework using Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to audit unlearning by analyzing mutual information in model representations before and after unlearning.

Result: Residual knowledge persists post-unlearning due to redundant information shared across models, correlating with vulnerability to adversarial attacks. A representation-based risk score is proposed to mitigate privacy risks.

Conclusion: The study provides a principled audit tool for unlearning in language models, offering theoretical insights and practical solutions for safer model deployment.

Abstract: We expose a critical limitation in current approaches to machine unlearning in language models: despite the apparent success of unlearning algorithms, information about the forgotten data remains linearly decodable from internal representations. To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose a representation-based risk score that can guide abstention on sensitive inputs at inference time, providing a practical mechanism to mitigate privacy leakage. Our work introduces a principled, representation-level audit for unlearning, offering theoretical insight and actionable tools for safer deployment of language models.

TL;DR: RAG-GFM is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that externalizes graph knowledge to overcome in-memory bottlenecks, enabling superior cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GFMs face limitations due to in-memory bottlenecks, hindering scalability and interpretability. RAG-GFM aims to offload knowledge and enhance adaptation.

Method: Uses a dual-modal retrieval module (semantic and structural stores), a dual-view alignment objective, and in-context augmentation for efficient adaptation.

Result: Outperforms 13 baselines in cross-domain node and graph classification across five datasets.

Conclusion: RAG-GFM effectively addresses GFM limitations by externalizing knowledge, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as a frontier in graph learning, which are expected to deliver transferable representations across diverse tasks. However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.

*Bostan Khan,Masoud Daneshtalab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedNAS addresses challenges in automated model design for Federated Learning by introducing DeepFedNAS, which optimizes supernet training and speeds up subnet discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FedNAS methods suffer from inefficient supernet training and lengthy post-training subnet discovery, hindering practical FL deployments.

Method: DeepFedNAS uses a multi-objective fitness function, Pareto-optimal cache training, and a predictor-free search method to optimize supernet weights and accelerate subnet discovery.

Result: DeepFedNAS improves accuracy (up to 1.21% on CIFAR-100), enhances efficiency, and reduces search time by ~61x (from 20 hours to 20 minutes).

Conclusion: DeepFedNAS makes FL deployments practical by significantly improving speed and accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) aims to automate model design for privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) but currently faces two critical bottlenecks: unguided supernet training that yields suboptimal models, and costly multi-hour pipelines for post-training subnet discovery. We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

*Tianshi Xu,Yuteng Chen,Meng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLEANER improves agentic RL for parameter-constrained LLMs by using self-correction to purify noisy trajectories, achieving better accuracy efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with noisy exploration phases and credit assignment issues in parameter-constrained LLMs, leading to inefficient policy optimization.

Method: CLEANER introduces the SAAR mechanism to autonomously replace failures with successful self-corrections during data collection based on semantic similarity.

Result: CLEANER achieves average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% on benchmarks like AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench, while reducing training steps.

Conclusion: CLEANER demonstrates that trajectory purification via self-correction is a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

*Yuval Ran-Milo,Yotam Alexander,Shahar Mendel,Nadav Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers trained with RL and sparse rewards develop Chain-of-Thought reasoning; gradient flow dynamics reveal emergence of structured algorithms on synthetic tasks, requiring distributional simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how sparse rewards in RL drive Transformers to develop systematic reasoning (Chain-of-Thought) and characterize the conditions enabling this emergence.

Method: Analysis of gradient flow dynamics in single-layer Transformers on synthetic graph traversal tasks, requiring CoT. Theoretical and empirical validation.

Result: Gradient flow converges to structured algorithms for graph traversal when training includes simpler examples; absence of such examples hinders learning.

Conclusion: Simple examples in training distributions are critical for RL-trained Transformers to learn generalizable CoT reasoning, validated theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Transformers trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision can spontaneously develop the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought). Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of "simple examples": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings.

TL;DR: ZENITH optimizer adapts learning rate using gradient norm evolution, outperforming baselines in accuracy and efficiency across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adaptive optimizers face issues like computational overhead and suboptimal learning rates, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: ZENITH adjusts learning rates based on the temporal evolution of gradient norms.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy faster in image classification and superior performance in object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation.

Conclusion: ZENITH is efficient, compatible with regularization, and improves generalization.

Abstract: Training deep computer vision models requires manual oversight or hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate (LR) schedule. While existing adaptive optimizers schedule the LR automatically, they suffer from computational and memory overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal LR choices. In this work, we introduce the ZENITH (Zero-overhead Evolution using Norm-Informed Training History) optimizer, which adapts the LR using the temporal evolution of the gradient norm. Image classification experiments spanning 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks demonstrate that ZENITH achieves higher test accuracy in lower wall-clock time than baselines. It also yielded superior mAP in object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation on MS COCO using the R-CNN family of models. Furthermore, its compatibility with regularization enables even better generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an author-assisted mechanism using the Isotonic Mechanism to improve best paper award selection by eliciting truthful author rankings and adjusting review scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing number of submissions at ML/AI conferences challenges the quality and consistency of peer review, especially for best paper awards.

Method: Uses the Isotonic Mechanism to collect authors' rankings of their submissions, adjusting raw review scores for better quality estimation.

Result: Authors are incentivized to report truthfully under convex additive utility, validated with ICLR and NeurIPS data. Truthfulness holds even with single-quota constraints.

Conclusion: The mechanism improves award selection quality and relaxes prior assumptions, with simulations confirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML now regularly receive tens of thousands of submissions, posing significant challenges to maintaining the quality and consistency of the peer review process. This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards.

TL;DR: MolecularIQ is a benchmark for evaluating chemistry LLMs' ability to reason about molecular graphs, focusing on symbolically verifiable tasks to avoid biases and provide detailed insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks often rely on biased or general chemical knowledge, reducing evaluation quality. MolecularIQ addresses this by focusing on verifiable molecular structure reasoning.

Method: Introduces MolecularIQ, a benchmark designed for symbolically verifiable tasks, enabling fine-grained analysis of LLMs' reasoning over molecular graphs.

Result: MolecularIQ localizes model failures to specific tasks and structures, offering actionable insights into chemistry LLMs' strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: MolecularIQ advances the evaluation of chemistry LLMs by focusing on faithful reasoning over molecular structures, guiding future model development.

Abstract: A molecule's properties are fundamentally determined by its composition and structure encoded in its molecular graph. Thus, reasoning about molecular properties requires the ability to parse and understand the molecular graph. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to chemistry, tackling tasks such as molecular name conversion, captioning, text-guided generation, and property or reaction prediction. Most existing benchmarks emphasize general chemical knowledge, rely on literature or surrogate labels that risk leakage or bias, or reduce evaluation to multiple-choice questions. We introduce MolecularIQ, a molecular structure reasoning benchmark focused exclusively on symbolically verifiable tasks. MolecularIQ enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning over molecular graphs and reveals capability patterns that localize model failures to specific tasks and molecular structures. This provides actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current chemistry LLMs and guides the development of models that reason faithfully over molecular structure.
