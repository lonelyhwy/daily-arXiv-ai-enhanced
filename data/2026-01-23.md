Result: Preprocessing boosts IoU and F1 scores. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational costs. Few-shot learning yields satisfactory metrics with limited data.

Conclusion: Thesis successfully addresses data scarcity in defect segmentation, enhancing performance through preprocessing, novel architecture, and few-shot learning.

Abstract: Culverts and sewer pipes are critical components of drainage systems, and their failure can lead to serious risks to public safety and the environment. In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.
  First, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost. Finally, we investigate few-shot semantic segmentation and its applicability to defect detection. Few-shot learning aims to train models with only limited data available. By employing a bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms, the model achieves richer feature representations and achieves satisfactory results across evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the potential of MLLMs for biometric applications, specifically HFR, due to their recent success in vision-language tasks.

Method: Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs across cross-modality scenarios (VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, VIS-THERMAL) using biometric protocols and metrics like Acquire Rate, EER, and TAR.

Result: Significant performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, especially in challenging cross-spectral conditions.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have limitations for HFR, emphasizing the need for rigorous biometric evaluation before deployment in face recognition systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of vision-language tasks, raising interest in their potential use for biometric applications. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs for heterogeneous face recognition (HFR), where enrollment and probe images are from different sensing modalities, including visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal camera. We benchmark multiple open-source MLLMs across several cross-modality scenarios, including VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, and VIS-THERMAL face recognition. The recognition performance of MLLMs is evaluated using biometric protocols and based on different metrics, including Acquire Rate, Equal Error Rate (EER), and True Accept Rate (TAR). Our results reveal substantial performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, particularly under challenging cross-spectral conditions, in spite of recent advances in MLLMs. Our findings highlight the limitations of current MLLMs for HFR and also the importance of rigorous biometric evaluation when considering their deployment in face recognition systems.

### [4] [DuFal: Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning for High-Fidelity Extremely Sparse-view CBCT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15416)
*Cuong Tran Van,Trong-Thang Pham,Ngoc-Son Nguyen,Duy Minh Ho Nguyen,Ngan Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DuFal, a dual-frequency-aware learning framework for sparse-view Cone-Beam CT reconstruction, outperforming existing methods by integrating frequency and spatial processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based methods struggle to recover fine structures due to bias toward low-frequency information.

Method: DuFal uses a dual-path architecture with High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operators, Spectral-Channel Factorization, and Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion.

Result: DuFal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets.

Conclusion: DuFal effectively preserves high-frequency anatomical features, especially in extremely sparse-view settings.

Abstract: Sparse-view Cone-Beam Computed Tomography reconstruction from limited X-ray projections remains a challenging problem in medical imaging due to the inherent undersampling of fine-grained anatomical details, which correspond to high-frequency components. Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.

### [5] [DevPrompt: Deviation-Based Prompt Learning for One-Normal ShotImage Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15453)
*Morteza Poudineh,Marc Lalonde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deviation-guided prompt learning framework for few-normal shot anomaly detection (FNSAD), improving discriminability and patch-level anomaly scoring using learnable prompts and deviation loss with Top-K MIL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in FNSAD lies in limited supervision and diverse defects. Existing methods using CLIP lack discriminability and principled scoring for anomalies.

Method: The framework uses learnable context vectors and anomaly-specific suffix tokens for alignment, combined with deviation loss and Top-K MIL for patch-level anomaly scoring.

Result: Experiments on MVTecAD and VISA show superior pixel-level detection over PromptAD and baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances anomaly detection and localization through learnable prompts and deviation-based scoring, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: Few-normal shot anomaly detection (FNSAD) aims to detect abnormal regions in images using only a few normal training samples, making the task highly challenging due to limited supervision and the diversity of potential defects. Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of learnable prompts, deviation-based scoring, and the Top-K MIL strategy.

### [6] [Seeing through Light and Darkness: Sensor-Physics Grounded Deblurring HDR NeRF from Single-Exposure Images and Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15475)
*Yunshan Qi,Lin Zhu,Nan Bao,Yifan Zhao,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from blurry LDR images and events, addressing mismatches and enhancing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with HDR and deblurring due to sensor-physics mismatches, prompting a need for a unified solution.

Method: Uses NeRF to represent HDR radiance, introduces RGB and event mapping fields to align sensor data with physical world radiance, and jointly optimizes these with NeRF.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results on collected and public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges sensor-physics gaps for improved HDR and sharp 3D representations.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from low dynamic range (LDR) blurry images, which are common in the wild, struggles to recover high dynamic range (HDR) and sharp 3D representations in extreme lighting conditions. Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images. A novel event mapping field is also designed to bridge the physical scene dynamics and actual event sensor output. The two mapping fields are jointly optimized with the NeRF network, leveraging the spatial and temporal dynamic information in events to enhance the sharp HDR 3D representation learning. Experiments on the collected and public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results with single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events.

### [7] [Hybrid Vision Transformer_GAN Attribute Neutralizer for Mitigating Bias in Chest X_Ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15490)
*Jobeal Solomon,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using a Vision Transformer (ViT) instead of a U-Net encoder reduces sex and age bias in chest X-ray classifiers while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bias in chest X-ray classifiers caused by demographic shortcuts, aiming for fairer AI diagnostics.

Method: Replace U-Net with ViT (DeiT-S) in Attribute-Neutral Framework; evaluate edited images for attribute leakage and disease prediction.

Result: ViT reduces sex-recognition AUC by ~10 points vs. U-Net, maintains diagnostic ROC AUC within 5 points, and keeps subgroup AUC ≥0.70.

Conclusion: ViT backbones can better suppress bias without compromising clinical utility, advancing fairer AI in chest X-ray analysis.

Abstract: Bias in chest X-ray classifiers frequently stems from sex- and age-related shortcuts, leading to systematic underdiagnosis of minority subgroups. Previous pixel-space attribute neutralizers, which rely on convolutional encoders, lessen but do not fully remove this attribute leakage at clinically usable edit strengths. This study evaluates whether substituting the U-Net convolutional encoder with a Vision Transformer backbone in the Attribute-Neutral Framework can reduce demographic attribute leakage while preserving diagnostic accuracy. A data-efficient Image Transformer Small (DeiT-S) neutralizer was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI.

### [8] [Controllable Layered Image Generation for Real-World Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15507)
*Jinrui Yang,Qing Liu,Yijun Li,Mengwei Ren,Letian Zhang,Zhe Lin,Cihang Xie,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASAGNA is a novel framework for generating images with composable layers, addressing limitations in controllability and visual effects. It introduces a new dataset and benchmark for layer editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models lack controllability and consistency when editing specific elements. Layered representations often fail to produce coherent layers with realistic visual effects.

Method: LASAGNA generates images jointly with composable layers (background and foreground) using diverse conditioning inputs (text prompts, masks). It includes LASAGNA-48K dataset and LASAGNABENCH.

Result: LASAGNA produces highly consistent and coherent results across layers, enabling accurate post-editing with preserved identity and visual effects.

Conclusion: LASAGNA advances layer-based image generation, offering greater controllability and realism. The released dataset and benchmark aim to foster further research.

Abstract: Recent image generation models have shown impressive progress, yet they often struggle to yield controllable and consistent results when users attempt to edit specific elements within an existing image. Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing. We demonstrate that LASAGNA excels in generating highly consistent and coherent results across multiple image layers simultaneously, enabling diverse post-editing applications that accurately preserve identity and visual effects. LASAGNA-48K and LASAGNABENCH will be publicly released to foster open research in the community. The project page is https://rayjryang.github.io/LASAGNA-Page/.

### [9] [DeltaDorsal: Enhancing Hand Pose Estimation with Dorsal Features in Egocentric Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15516)
*William Huang,Siyou Pei,Leyi Zou,Eric J. Gonzalez,Ishan Chatterjee,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-stream delta encoder improves egocentric hand pose estimation by using dorsal hand skin deformation, reducing MPJAE by 18% in occluded scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric hand pose estimation faces challenges due to finger occlusions. Leveraging dorsal hand skin deformation offers a solution.

Method: Proposes a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a relaxed baseline position.

Result: Reduces Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in highly occluded scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method enhances reliability in occluded scenarios and enables new interaction paradigms while minimizing model size.

Abstract: The proliferation of XR devices has made egocentric hand pose estimation a vital task, yet this perspective is inherently challenged by frequent finger occlusions. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the rich information in dorsal hand skin deformation, unlocked by recent advances in dense visual featurizers. We introduce a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a baseline relaxed position. Our evaluation demonstrates that, using only cropped dorsal images, our method reduces the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers >=50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art techniques that depend on the whole hand's geometry and large model backbones. Consequently, our method not only enhances the reliability of downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios but also unlocks new interaction paradigms, such as detecting isometric force for a surface "click" without visible movement while minimizing model size.

### [10] [VIOLA: Towards Video In-Context Learning with Minimal Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15549)
*Ryo Fujii,Hideo Saito,Ryo Hachiuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIOLA is a label-efficient framework for adapting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains using minimal expert supervision and abundant unlabeled data, outperforming baselines in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting MLLMs to new video domains is challenging due to scarce labeled data, especially in specialized environments where expert annotations are impractical.

Method: VIOLA combines density-uncertainty-weighted sampling for efficient annotation use and confidence-aware retrieval/prompting to leverage unlabeled data without noise.

Result: The framework outperforms baselines across nine benchmarks using four MLLMs, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.

Conclusion: VIOLA effectively bridges the gap in low-resource video domain adaptation by integrating minimal expert supervision with unlabeled data.

Abstract: Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.

### [11] [Relative Classification Accuracy: A Calibrated Metric for Identity Consistency in Fine-Grained K-pop Face Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15560)
*Sylvey Lin,Eranki Vasistha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation show high visual quality but suffer semantic mode collapse, revealed by a new metric RCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate semantic controllability of DDPMs in fine-grained tasks like K-pop idol face generation, where standard metrics fail.

Method: Propose Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA) to normalize generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline.

Result: Model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93) but severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), especially for ambiguous identities.

Conclusion: The framework introduces RCA for rigorous identity consistency verification in conditional generative models, highlighting resolution and ambiguity challenges.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity image generation. However, evaluating their semantic controllability-specifically for fine-grained, single-domain tasks-remains challenging. Standard metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) often fail to detect identity misalignment in such specialized contexts. In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities. We analyze these failure modes through confusion matrices and attribute them to resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity. Our framework provides a rigorous standard for verifying identity consistency in conditional generative models.

*Ning Jiang,Dingheng Zeng,Yanhong Liu,Haiyang Yi,Shijie Yu,Minghe Weng,Haifeng Shen,Ying Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework with automated CoT data generation is proposed, reducing annotation costs and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of explainable outputs in deepfake detection and explores MLLMs' potential, hindered by scarce high-quality annotated datasets.

Method: Uses Self-Blended Images for automated CoT data generation and integrates RL for enhanced performance and cross-domain generalization.

Result: Achieves competitive SOTA performance across cross-dataset benchmarks, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully reduces annotation costs and leverages RL for improved deepfake detection.

Abstract: Most prior deepfake detection methods lack explainable outputs. With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach. Our method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple cross-dataset benchmarks. Implementation details are available at https://github.com/deon1219/rlsbi.

*Bo Yuan,Danpei Zhao,Wentao Li,Tian Li,Zhiguo Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continual Panoptic Perception (CPP), extending continual learning to multimodal and multi-task scenarios, addressing issues like semantic obfuscation and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning research focuses on single-task scenarios, limiting applications in multi-task and multimodal contexts. This paper aims to bridge this gap by integrating multimodal and multi-task continual learning for comprehensive image perception.

Method: The proposed CPP model includes a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE), malleable knowledge inheritance via contrastive distillation, cross-modal consistency constraints (CPP+), and asymmetric pseudo-labeling for exemplar-free learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model's superiority, especially in fine-grained continual learning tasks, outperforming existing approaches in multimodal datasets.

Conclusion: The CPP model effectively addresses challenges in multimodal and multi-task continual learning, offering robust solutions for incremental training and semantic alignment.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a great endeavour in developing intelligent perception AI systems. However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse CL tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, particularly in fine-grained CL tasks.

*Zichen Yu,Quanli Liu,Wei Wang,Liyong Zhang,Xiaoguang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperOcc is a novel framework for 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, addressing sparsity and efficiency challenges with cohesive temporal modeling, multi-superquadric decoding, and efficient splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D occupancy prediction often rely on dense scene representations, ignoring the sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Superquadric representations offer a sparse alternative but face challenges like insufficient temporal modeling and inefficient splatting.

Method: SuperOcc introduces three key components: cohesive temporal modeling (combining view-centric and object-centric cues), multi-superquadric decoding (enhancing expressiveness without sacrificing sparsity), and efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting (improving computational efficiency).

Result: SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks while maintaining superior efficiency.

Conclusion: SuperOcc effectively addresses challenges in sparse 3D occupancy prediction, offering improved performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in the realm of autonomous driving, as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the driving environment. Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event-VStream is an event-aware framework for real-time long video understanding, improving efficiency and performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in real-time video understanding by avoiding redundant frame processing and retaining crucial temporal context.

Method: Uses event detection via motion, semantic, and predictive cues, consolidates events into memory, and triggers generation at boundaries.

Result: Outperforms baselines (+10.4 points on OVOBench-Realtime) and maintains 70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour streams.

Conclusion: Event-VStream offers efficient, effective real-time video understanding by focusing on semantically coherent events.

Abstract: Real-time understanding of long video streams remains challenging for multimodal large language models (VLMs) due to redundant frame processing and rapid forgetting of past context. Existing streaming systems rely on fixed-interval decoding or cache pruning, which either produce repetitive outputs or discard crucial temporal information. We introduce Event-VStream, an event-aware framework that represents continuous video as a sequence of discrete, semantically coherent events. Our system detects meaningful state transitions by integrating motion, semantic, and predictive cues, and triggers language generation only at those boundaries. Each event embedding is consolidated into a persistent memory bank, enabling long-horizon reasoning while maintaining low latency. Across OVOBench-Realtime, and long-form Ego4D evaluations, Event-VStream achieves competitive performance. It improves over a VideoLLM-Online-8B baseline by +10.4 points on OVOBench-Realtime, achieves performance close to Flash-VStream-7B despite using only a general-purpose LLaMA-3-8B text backbone, and maintains around 70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour Ego4D streams.

TL;DR: Skywork UniPic 3.0 is a unified multimodal framework for multi-image composition, focusing on HOI tasks. It outperforms existing models with efficient training and inference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of detailed methods for high-quality multi-image composition, particularly for HOI tasks, by integrating single-image editing and multi-image composition into one framework.

Method: Develops a data pipeline for 700K high-quality samples, formulates composition as sequence modeling, and uses trajectory mapping for fast inference (8 steps).

Result: Achieves SOTA in single-image editing and surpasses Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 in multi-image composition, with 12.5x speedup.

Conclusion: Skywork UniPic 3.0's data pipeline and training paradigm effectively address multi-image composition challenges, validated by benchmark results.

Abstract: The recent surge in popularity of Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 underscores the community's strong interest in multi-image composition tasks. Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm. Code, models and dataset are publicly available.

*Yikui Zhai,Shikuang Liu,Wenlve Zhou,Hongsheng Zhang,Zhiheng Zhou,Xiaolin Tian,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cr-GAN, a novel GAN framework for few-shot SAR imagery recognition, addressing data scarcity by enabling stable training with limited samples and boosting SSL performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot SAR recognition is hindered by extreme data scarcity, and traditional GANs fail due to their need for abundant data. Cr-GAN aims to overcome this paradox.

Method: Cr-GAN uses a dual-branch discriminator, channel-wise feature interpolation, and dual-domain cycle consistency to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples from limited data.

Result: Cr-GAN achieves 71.21% and 51.64% accuracy on MSTAR and SRSDD datasets in 8-shot settings, outperforming baselines with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Cr-GAN effectively resolves the data scarcity paradox in few-shot SAR recognition, enhancing SSL performance with synthesized data.

Abstract: Few-shot recognition in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery remains a critical bottleneck for real-world applications due to extreme data scarcity. A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

### [18] [Performance-guided Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15688)
*Zhixuan Liang,Xingyu Zeng,Rui Zhao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGRAL introduces a reinforcement learning-based active learning method for object detection, guided by expected model performance (mAP), improving efficiency and reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AL methods evaluate data informativeness without directly linking it to downstream task performance, such as mAP in object detection.

Method: MGRAL uses reinforcement learning (policy gradient) to optimize batch sample selection, leveraging mAP improvement as a reward, and employs unsupervised techniques for efficient mAP estimation.

Result: MGRAL achieves superior active learning performance on PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MGRAL sets a new standard for reinforcement learning-driven active learning in object detection, combining performance guidance with computational feasibility.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) strategies aim to train high-performance models with minimal labeling efforts, only selecting the most informative instances for annotation. Current approaches to evaluating data informativeness predominantly focus on the data's distribution or intrinsic information content and do not directly correlate with downstream task performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, MGRAL utilizes an unsupervised way with fast look-up tables, ensuring feasible deployment. We evaluate MGRAL's active learning performance on detection tasks over PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates the highest AL curve with convincing visualizations, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-driven active object detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Beyond Visual Safety (BVS), a framework to test visual safety boundaries in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by inducing harmful image generation with a high success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks sufficient exploration of visual safety vulnerabilities in MLLMs, prompting the need for a dedicated framework to probe these boundaries.

Method: BVS uses a 'reconstruction-then-generation' strategy, combining neutralized visual splicing and inductive recomposition to decouple malicious intent from inputs, tricking MLLMs into generating harmful content.

Result: BVS achieved a 98.21% jailbreak success rate against GPT-5, revealing significant vulnerabilities in MLLM visual safety alignment.

Conclusion: The study highlights urgent gaps in MLLM visual safety and underscores the need for improved defensive measures.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has introduced complex security challenges, particularly at the intersection of textual and visual safety. While existing schemes have explored the security vulnerabilities of MLLMs, the investigation into their visual safety boundaries remains insufficient. In this paper, we propose Beyond Visual Safety (BVS), a novel image-text pair jailbreaking framework specifically designed to probe the visual safety boundaries of MLLMs. BVS employs a "reconstruction-then-generation" strategy, leveraging neutralized visual splicing and inductive recomposition to decouple malicious intent from raw inputs, thereby leading MLLMs to be induced into generating harmful images. Experimental results demonstrate that BVS achieves a remarkable jailbreak success rate of 98.21\% against GPT-5 (12 January 2026 release). Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in the visual safety alignment of current MLLMs.

*Ali Caglayan,Nevrez Imamoglu,Toru Kouyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces lightweight refinements to improve SAR-based LULC semantic segmentation and water detection in Japan, addressing common failure modes without added complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to enhance SAR dense-prediction accuracy, particularly for thin structures and rare classes, while avoiding pipeline complexity.

Method: Three refinements are proposed: high-resolution feature injection, a progressive refine-up head, and tempered class reweighting within a focal+dice objective.

Result: The model shows consistent improvements on Japan-wide benchmarks, especially for underrepresented classes and water detection.

Conclusion: The refinements effectively address key SAR segmentation challenges, improving performance without increasing complexity.

Abstract: This work focuses on national-scale land-use/land-cover (LULC) semantic segmentation using ALOS-2 single-polarization (HH) SAR data over Japan, together with a companion binary water detection task. Building on SAR-W-MixMAE self-supervised pretraining [1], we address common SAR dense-prediction failure modes, boundary over-smoothing, missed thin/slender structures, and rare-class degradation under long-tailed labels, without increasing pipeline complexity. We introduce three lightweight refinements: (i) injecting high-resolution features into multi-scale decoding, (ii) a progressive refine-up head that alternates convolutional refinement and stepwise upsampling, and (iii) an $α$-scale factor that tempers class reweighting within a focal+dice objective. The resulting model yields consistent improvements on the Japan-wide ALOS-2 LULC benchmark, particularly for under-represented classes, and improves water detection across standard evaluation metrics.

*Shubham Shukla,Kunal Sonalkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for fine-grained fashion attribute prediction, introducing a three-tier framework to assess overall performance, attribute applicability detection, and classification. VLMs show strong classification but struggle with detecting attribute applicability, highlighting a deployment bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained attribute prediction is critical for fashion retail, but VLMs' performance on conditional attributes (e.g., undefined when not visible) remains underexplored. The study aims to systematically evaluate VLMs.

Method: A three-tier framework evaluates VLMs: overall performance, applicability detection, and fine-grained classification. Nine VLMs are benchmarked using DeepFashion-MultiModal on 5,000 images across 18 attributes.

Result: VLMs achieved 64.0% macro-F1 (outperforming logistic regression), excelled in classification (70.8% F1), but struggled with applicability detection (34.1% NA-F1). Efficient models delivered 90% of flagship performance.

Conclusion: The framework helps diagnose errors in visibility detection or classification, guiding improvements for production systems. Efficient VLMs offer practical deployment solutions.

Abstract: Fine-grained attribute prediction is essential for fashion retail applications including catalog enrichment, visual search, and recommendation systems. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, "outer fabric" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoThinker addresses long-form video understanding challenges by using synthetic tool interaction trajectories, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with temporal localization and information loss in long videos due to static reasoning.

Method: VideoThinker converts videos into captions, generates tool-use sequences, and grounds them back to video frames.

Result: VideoThinker outperforms caption-only agents and video baselines in long-video benchmarks.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented synthetic data and adaptive reasoning significantly improve long-form video understanding.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for current Video Large Language Models. Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use. Remarkably, VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval and zoom reasoning for long-form video understanding.

TL;DR: A novel framework for adapting foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging, featuring sub-region-aware modality attention and adaptive prompt engineering, significantly improves brain tumor segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with multi-modal fusion and adapting to heterogeneous pathological tissues, highlighting the need for better adaptation techniques.

Method: Introduces sub-region-aware modality attention and adaptive prompt engineering to optimize modality combinations and refine segmentation.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods on the BraTS 2020 dataset, especially in necrotic core segmentation.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective approach for multi-modal fusion and prompting, advancing foundation model applications in medical imaging.

Abstract: The successful adaptation of foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging is a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing models often struggle to effectively fuse information from multiple sources and adapt to the heterogeneous nature of pathological tissues. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for adapting foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging, featuring two key technical innovations: sub-region-aware modality attention and adaptive prompt engineering. The attention mechanism enables the model to learn the optimal combination of modalities for each tumor sub-region, while the adaptive prompting strategy leverages the inherent capabilities of foundation models to refine segmentation accuracy. We validate our framework on the BraTS 2020 brain tumor segmentation dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, particularly in the challenging necrotic core sub-region. Our work provides a principled and effective approach to multi-modal fusion and prompting, paving the way for more accurate and robust foundation model-based solutions in medical imaging.

*Xinjue Hu,Chi Wang,Boyu Wang,Xiang Zhang,Zhenshan Tan,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARDIS is a novel framework for deep image steganography that allows arbitrary resolution secret images to be hidden and recovered without detail loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep image steganography methods require secret and cover images to have the same resolution, causing detail loss and limiting flexibility. ARDIS addresses this by enabling arbitrary resolution handling.

Method: ARDIS uses a Frequency Decoupling Architecture to hide resolution-aligned global basis and resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent in the cover. For recovery, a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor and Implicit Resolution Coding ensure accurate blind restoration.

Result: ARDIS achieves superior performance in invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ARDIS successfully shifts the paradigm to continuous signal reconstruction, enabling faithful recovery of arbitrary resolution secret images without prior resampling.

Abstract: Deep image steganography (DIS) has achieved significant results in capacity and invisibility. However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity.

TL;DR: ES-mHC is a hyper-connection framework improving interpretability in hyperspectral image classification by modeling electromagnetic spectrum interactions with structured matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in HSIC lack interpretability due to opaque spectral-spatial feature mixing, limiting understanding of decision mechanisms.

Method: Proposes ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework using structured matrices to model explicit interactions among electromagnetic spectrum groupings.

Result: Learned hyper-connection matrices show coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric behaviors, revealing internal dynamics. Higher expansion rates accelerate structured patterns.

Conclusion: ES-mHC enhances transparency in HSIC, transforming it from a black-box task to a partially white-box process.

Abstract: In hyperspectral image classification (HSIC), most deep learning models rely on opaque spectral-spatial feature mixing, limiting their interpretability and hindering understanding of internal decision mechanisms. We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics. Furthermore, we find that increasing the expansion rate accelerates the emergence of structured interaction patterns. These results suggest that ES-mHC transforms HSIC from a purely black-box prediction task into a structurally transparent, partially white-box learning process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeTal-SAM adapts SAM for fetal brain MRI segmentation using atlas-based prompts, addressing inflexibility in label definitions and providing insights into segmentation drivers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods lack flexibility for changing clinical/research needs and insights into segmentation drivers.

Method: FeTal-SAM integrates multi-atlas registration for dense prompts and bounding boxes, enabling binary segmentation per-structure fused into 3D volumes.

Result: Achieves comparable Dice scores to state-of-the-art baselines for well-contrasted structures, with slightly lower accuracy for low-contrast ones.

Conclusion: FeTal-SAM shows promise as a general-purpose segmentation model adaptable to various clinical needs without extensive retraining.

Abstract: This paper presents FeTal-SAM, a novel adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) tailored for fetal brain MRI segmentation. Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages. Notably, it achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines which were trained for each dataset and label definition for well-contrasted structures like cortical plate and cerebellum, while maintaining the flexibility to segment any user-specified anatomy. Although slightly lower accuracy is observed for subtle, low-contrast structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala), our results highlight FeTal-SAM's potential to serve as a general-purpose segmentation model without exhaustive retraining. This method thus constitutes a promising step toward clinically adaptable fetal brain MRI analysis tools.

TL;DR: LL-GaussianMap introduces an unsupervised framework using 2D Gaussian Splatting for low-light image enhancement, focusing on structural priors and avoiding paired data dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect intrinsic geometric structural priors in low-light image enhancement. 2D Gaussian Splatting's structural fitting capabilities are unexplored for such tasks.

Method: The framework splits into two stages: high-fidelity structural reconstruction using 2DGS and rendering enhancement coefficients via Gaussian splatting's rasterization.

Result: LL-GaussianMap achieves superior performance with low storage, validating explicit Gaussian representations for enhancement.

Conclusion: Incorporating 2DGS into low-light enhancement preserves edges, suppresses artifacts, and operates without paired data, showcasing its effectiveness.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in low-light image enhancement with respect to visual quality. However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that LL-GaussianMap achieves superior enhancement performance with an extremely low storage footprint, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit Gaussian representations for image enhancement.

TL;DR: 2DGS-compressed images lack efficient low-light enhancement methods. LL-GaussianImage offers a zero-shot, unsupervised framework enhancing such images directly in the compressed domain, ensuring high quality and compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-light enhancement methods require decompression, reducing efficiency and quality. Addressing this gap, LL-GaussianImage aims to enhance images directly in the 2DGS compressed domain without decompression.

Method: Proposes a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts framework applying adaptive transformations to 2DGS attributes, uses multi-objective loss functions for quality, and employs a two-stage optimization process.

Result: Achieves high-quality low-light enhancement while maintaining compression ratios, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: LL-GaussianImage demonstrates feasibility and superiority in directly enhancing 2DGS-compressed images, avoiding decompression pitfalls.

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is an emerging explicit scene representation method with significant potential for image compression due to high fidelity and high compression ratios. However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain. Processing 2DGS-compressed images necessitates a cumbersome decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline, which compromises efficiency and introduces secondary degradation. To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced. High-quality enhancement of low-light images is achieved while high compression ratios are maintained. The feasibility and superiority of the paradigm for direct processing within the compressed representation domain are validated through experimental results.

Result: On the AC3 and AC4 datasets, the method improved the ARAND metric by 32.1% and 30.7%, respectively, under low-annotation regimes when combined with post-processing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based approach effectively enriches the training set and enhances neuron segmentation performance, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: Neuron segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) aims to reconstruct the complete neuronal connectome; however, current deep learning-based methods are limited by their reliance on large-scale training data and extensive, time-consuming manual annotations. Traditional methods augment the training set through geometric and photometric transformations; however, the generated samples remain highly correlated with the original images and lack structural diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism. Together, these components effectively enrich the training set and improve segmentation performance. On the AC3 and AC4 datasets under low-annotation regimes, our method improves the ARAND metric by 32.1% and 30.7%, respectively, when combined with two different post-processing methods.

### [31] [Assessing Situational and Spatial Awareness of VLMs with Synthetically Generated Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15780)
*Pascal Benschop,Justin Dauwels,Jan van Gemert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic benchmark to assess spatial and situational awareness in VLMs, revealing their fragility in handling subtle cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragility of VLMs in spatial reasoning tasks, especially when semantics depend on subtle temporal or geometric cues.

Method: A synthetic benchmark with minimal video pairs tests three challenges: distinguishing violence, binding assailant roles, and judging trajectory alignment.

Result: VLMs perform only slightly above chance; stable color cues help partially but don't resolve core issues.

Conclusion: The benchmark aims to provide reproducible diagnostics and inspire lightweight spatial priors to complement pretraining.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) remains fragile when semantics hinge on subtle temporal or geometric cues. We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks. A simple aid, stable color cues, partly reduces assailant role confusions but does not resolve the underlying weakness. By releasing data and code, we aim to provide reproducible diagnostics and seed exploration of lightweight spatial priors to complement large-scale pretraining.

*Mustafa Yurdakul,Enes Ayan,Fahrettin Horasan,Sakir Tasdemir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper developed a CNN-based mobile app for flower classification, testing three models and seven optimization algorithms, with DenseNet-121 achieving the highest accuracy (95.84%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying flower types requires expert knowledge, which isn't always accessible. The study aimed to provide non-specialists with easy access to flower information via a mobile app.

Method: Three CNN models (MobileNet, DenseNet121, Xception) were tested with seven optimization algorithms to classify flowers.

Result: DenseNet-121 with SGD optimization achieved the best performance (95.84% accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, F1-score).

Conclusion: CNNs are effective for flower classification in mobile applications, with DenseNet-121 being the most suitable model.

Abstract: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm that has been specifically designed for computer vision applications. The CNNs proved successful in handling the increasing amount of data in many computer vision problems, where classical machine learning algorithms were insufficient. Flowers have many uses in our daily lives, from decorating to making medicines to detoxifying the environment. Identifying flower types requires expert knowledge. However, accessing experts at any time and in any location may not always be feasible. In this study a mobile application based on CNNs was developed to recognize different types of flowers to provide non-specialists with quick and easy access to information about flower types. The study employed three distinct CNN models, namely MobileNet, DenseNet121, and Xception, to determine the most suitable model for the mobile application. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score. This result shows that CNNs can be used for flower classification in mobile applications.

*Clare Chemery,Hendrik Edelhoff,Ludwig Bothmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight ML pipeline helps ecologists classify ecological images easily, achieving high accuracy for age and sex classification of red deer without needing advanced ML skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To lower the barrier for applying ML in ecological research by enabling ecologists to tailor models to local datasets and specific tasks without advanced expertise.

Method: Combines CLI for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with GUI for annotation and error analysis. Tested on classifying red deer age and sex from camera trap images.

Result: Best models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age and 96.15% for sex classification, showing reliable demographic classification with limited data.

Conclusion: The framework makes ML accessible for ecologists, promoting its use in wildlife monitoring and demographic analysis.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight experimentation pipeline designed to lower the barrier for applying machine learning (ML) methods for classifying images in ecological research. We enable ecologists to experiment with ML models independently, thus they can move beyond off-the-shelf models and generate insights tailored to local datasets and specific classification tasks and target variables. Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies. Our best-performing models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age classification and 96.15% for sex classification. These results demonstrate that reliable demographic classification is feasible even with limited data to answer narrow, well-defined ecological problems. More broadly, the framework provides ecologists with an accessible tool for developing ML models tailored to specific research questions, paving the way for broader adoption of ML in wildlife monitoring and demographic analysis.

*Yonghao Xu,Pedram Ghamisi,Qihao Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces dataset distillation to remote sensing image interpretation, using a diffusion model and classifier-driven guidance to create a compact, representative dataset, validated on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of high storage/computational costs and data leakage risks in deep learning for remote sensing by distilling large datasets into compact ones.

Method: Training a text-to-image diffusion model with classifier-driven guidance and latent space clustering to synthesize diverse, representative samples.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks confirm the method's ability to distill realistic, diverse samples for downstream training.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset distillation approach effectively addresses data challenges in remote sensing, with promising results.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of deep learning in remote sensing image interpretation, driven by the availability of large-scale benchmark datasets. However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training. Code and pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/DPD).

All sensor data is wirelessly transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for remote monitoring, historical analysis, and automated alert generation. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels (with 92\% accuracy), providing real-time environmental monitoring, and reducing water consumption by approximately 40\% compared to conventional irrigation methods. The integrated web dashboard offers comprehensive visualization of plant health parameters, making it suitable for both small-scale gardening and commercial agriculture applications. With a total implementation cost of \$45.20, this system provides an affordable, scalable solution for precision agriculture and smart farming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for device-free, privacy-preserving sensing by reducing the networking resource strain caused by processing large CSI data volumes in Wi-Fi sensing.

Method: Utilizes a VQGAN-learned codebook and K-means clustering for dynamic bitrate adjustment, plus a Transformer model for bitrate loss mitigation. Prototyped on Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi.

Result: Achieves 1.5x higher HPE accuracy (PCK20), reduces latency by 5x, and cuts networking overhead by 2.5x compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TinySense offers a scalable, efficient solution for Wi-Fi-based HPE, balancing accuracy and resource use effectively.

Abstract: With the growing demand for device-free and privacy-preserving sensing solutions, Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a promising approach for human pose estimation (HPE). However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x. The code repository is available online at here.

Conclusion: Validates brain-inspired mechanisms for lightweight medical image analysis, offering a practical solution for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Background: Coronary angiography (CAG) is a cornerstone imaging modality for assessing coronary artery disease and guiding interventional treatment decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve security in ML model deployments by better detecting distribution shifts in practical applications.

Method: Uses Total Variation Network Estimator to compute each input's contribution (total variation score) to discriminate in- vs. out-of-distribution data.

Result: Consistently achieved comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art out-of-distribution detection techniques in image classification.

Conclusion: TV-OOD is an effective method for securing ML models against distribution shifts, demonstrating robustness across diverse datasets and models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to securing machine learning model deployments against potential distribution shifts in practical applications, the Total Variation Out-of-Distribution (TV-OOD) detection method. Existing methods have produced satisfactory results, but TV-OOD improves upon these by leveraging the Total Variation Network Estimator to calculate each input's contribution to the overall total variation. By defining this as the total variation score, TV-OOD discriminates between in- and out-of-distribution data. The method's efficacy was tested across a range of models and datasets, consistently yielding results in image classification tasks that were either comparable or superior to those achieved by leading-edge out-of-distribution detection techniques across all evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset to address limitations in existing datasets for AI-based contrast-enhanced image synthesis. It includes MR and CT data with complete contrast phases and establishes a benchmark for evaluating translation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets for AI-based contrast-enhanced image synthesis are limited by focusing on brain MR, partial pairing, missing modalities, or lack of labeling. This paper aims to bridge this gap with a comprehensive, public dataset.

Method: The authors created a fully paired, pan-cancer dataset spanning 11 organs, including complete DCE sequences for MR and paired non-contrast/contrast-enhanced CT. They used this dataset to benchmark contemporary image-to-image translation methods.

Result: The dataset enables rigorous evaluation of translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Results from baseline methods demonstrate its utility for advancing contrast synthesis research.

Conclusion: The released dataset and benchmark aim to catalyze research on safe, effective contrast synthesis, with direct relevance to multi-organ oncology workflows. The code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Contrast medium plays a pivotal role in radiological imaging, as it amplifies lesion conspicuity and improves detection for the diagnosis of tumor-related diseases. However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation. We release the dataset and benchmark to catalyze research on safe, effective contrast synthesis, with direct relevance to multi-organ oncology imaging workflows. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/YifanChen02/PMPBench.

TL;DR: The study explores how alignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks affects vision foundation models (VFMs) in clinical imaging tasks, finding better alignment leads to improved performance and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why VFMs show uneven improvements across tasks despite heavy computational investment, focusing on pretraining-task alignment in clinical imaging.

Method: Assessed two VFMs (ProFound and ProViCNet) on five prostate MR imaging tasks, measuring alignment using divergence metrics like MMD.

Result: Better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks correlated with greater performance improvements and faster convergence.

Conclusion: Designing pretraining objectives with downstream task alignment in mind is crucial for optimizing VFM performance.

Abstract: Foundation models leverage large-scale pretraining to capture extensive knowledge, demonstrating generalization in a wide range of language tasks. By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.

TL;DR: RadJEPA is a self-supervised framework for learning radiology encoders without language supervision, achieving superior performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on paired image-text data and explore robust radiology encoder learning without language supervision.

Method: Uses a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) to predict latent representations of masked image regions, trained solely on unlabeled chest X-ray images.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Rad-DINO in disease classification, semantic segmentation, and report generation tasks.

Conclusion: RadJEPA demonstrates effective self-supervised learning for radiology encoders, eliminating the need for language supervision.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision language models guide the learning of visual representations; however, this form of supervision is constrained by the availability of paired image text data, raising the question of whether robust radiology encoders can be learned without relying on language supervision. In this work, we introduce RadJEPA, a self-supervised framework built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that learns without language supervision. Pre-trained solely on unlabeled chest X-ray images, the model learns to predict latent representations of masked image regions. This predictive objective differs fundamentally from both image text pre-training and DINO-style self-distillation: rather than aligning global representations across views or modalities, RadJEPA explicitly models latent-space prediction. We evaluate the learned encoder on disease classification, semantic segmentation, and report generation tasks. Across benchmarks, RadJEPA achieves performance exceeding state-of-the-art approaches, including Rad-DINO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover how emotions are represented in large-scale multimodal foundation models and understand the internal mechanisms supporting affective tasks.

Method: Systematic mechanistic study across architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, analyzing emotion-oriented supervision's impact on model parameters. Techniques include module transfer, single-module adaptation, and ablation.

Result: Affective adaptation focuses on 	exttt{gate\_proj}, not attention modules. Tuning 24.5\% of parameters achieves 96.6\% of AffectGPT's performance across eight tasks, showing efficiency.

Conclusion: Affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating, with 	exttt{gate\_proj} as a central architectural locus.

Abstract: Understanding where and how emotions are represented in large-scale foundation models remains an open problem, particularly in multimodal affective settings. Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\texttt{gate\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \texttt{gate\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \texttt{gate\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks SOTA models for real-time emotion recognition in VR therapy for ASD, identifying a latency-accuracy trade-off issue and recommending lightweight, domain-specific solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support individuals with ASD by improving social skills through real-time emotion recognition in VR, while addressing the strict latency constraints (<140 ms) for effective therapeutic use.

Method: Benchmarking YOLO variants (v8, v11, v12) and general-purpose Vision Transformers (CLIP, SigLIP, ViT-FER) on CPU-only inference using the UIBVFED dataset for Zero-Shot FER on virtual characters.

Result: Face detection is robust (100% accuracy), but classification faces a 'Latency Wall.' YOLOv11n balances detection (~54 ms), while CLIP/SigLIP fail (<23% accuracy, >150 ms).

Conclusion: Lightweight, domain-specific architectures are essential for accessible, real-time AI in VR therapy due to the inadequacy of general-purpose models.

Abstract: In the realm of Virtual Reality (VR) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), real-time emotion recognition shows promise for supporting individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in improving social skills. This task requires a strict latency-accuracy trade-off, with motion-to-photon (MTP) latency kept below 140 ms to maintain contingency. However, most off-the-shelf Deep Learning models prioritize accuracy over the strict timing constraints of commodity hardware. As a first step toward accessible VR therapy, we benchmark State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition (FER) on virtual characters using the UIBVFED dataset. We evaluate Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, and v12) for face detection, alongside general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and ViT-FER.Our results on CPU-only inference demonstrate that while face detection on stylized avatars is robust (100% accuracy), a "Latency Wall" exists in the classification stage. The YOLOv11n architecture offers the optimal balance for detection (~54 ms). However, general-purpose Transformers like CLIP and SigLIP fail to achieve viable accuracy (<23%) or speed (>150 ms) for real-time loops. This study highlights the necessity for lightweight, domain-specific architectures to enable accessible, real-time AI in therapeutic settings.

Result: Significant improvements demonstrated on CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets across varying imbalance factors.

Conclusion: The proposed loss-level re-weighting scheme effectively addresses long-tailed learning challenges, validating theoretical discussions with empirical results.

Abstract: Deep neural network models degrade significantly in the long-tailed data distribution, with the overall training data dominated by a small set of classes in the head, and the tail classes obtaining less training examples. Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits. In the practical implementation stage of the proposed scheme, we use an Ω(p_t, f_c) function. This function enables the modulation of the contribution towards the training task based upon the confidence value of the prediction, as well as the relative frequency of the corresponding class. Our observations in the experiments are corroborated by significant experimental results performed on the CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets under various values of imbalance factors that clearly authenticate the theoretical discussions above.

*Liuyun Jiang,Yizhuo Lu,Yanchao Zhang,Jiazheng Liu,Hua Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroMamba is a novel framework combining Mamba's linear complexity for global modeling with local feature extraction to improve neuron segmentation accuracy by addressing CNN and Transformer limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuron segmentation is critical for brain connectome reconstruction but is hindered by irregular neuron morphology and dense structures. Existing CNN and Transformer methods have shortcomings in boundary resolution and voxel-level detail preservation.

Method: NeuroMamba integrates a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) for local details and a Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE) with resolution-aware scanning for global dependencies. A cross-modulation mechanism fuses these features.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public EM datasets, showing adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions.

Conclusion: NeuroMamba effectively balances global and local feature modeling, offering superior neuron segmentation accuracy and resolution adaptability.

Abstract: Neuron segmentation is the cornerstone of reconstructing comprehensive neuronal connectomes, which is essential for deciphering the functional organization of the brain. The irregular morphology and densely intertwined structures of neurons make this task particularly challenging. Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions. The source code will be made publicly available.

*Sheng Miao,Sijin Li,Pan Wang,Dongfeng Bai,Bingbing Liu,Yue Wang,Andreas Geiger,Yiyi Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvolSplat4D is a feed-forward framework for novel view synthesis in static and dynamic urban scenes, balancing quality and efficiency by combining volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across specialized branches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis in urban scenes either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or suffer from 3D inconsistencies in dynamic environments. EvolSplat4D aims to address these limitations by unifying volume-based and pixel-based approaches.

Method: EvolSplat4D uses three specialized branches: (1) a 3D feature volume for static regions to predict consistent geometry, (2) object-centric canonical spaces and motion-adjusted rendering for dynamic actors, and (3) an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch for far-field scenery.

Result: Experiments on KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets demonstrate that EvolSplat4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and consistency for both static and dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: EvolSplat4D provides a superior balance of reconstruction quality and efficiency for novel view synthesis in urban environments, addressing key challenges in both static and dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of static and dynamic urban scenes is essential for autonomous driving simulation, yet existing methods often struggle to balance reconstruction time with quality. While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.

*Xin Xie,Jiaxian Guo,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperAlign is a novel framework using a hypernetwork for efficient test-time alignment in diffusion models, outperforming existing methods in semantic consistency and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with aligning outputs to human preferences, leading to poor aesthetic quality and semantic inconsistencies. Existing alignment methods suffer from trade-offs between diversity loss and computational overhead.

Method: HyperAlign trains a hypernetwork to dynamically generate low-rank adaptation weights for modulating diffusion model operators, adjusting the denoising trajectory based on input latents, timesteps, and prompts.

Result: HyperAlign significantly outperforms fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal across models like Stable Diffusion and FLUX.

Conclusion: HyperAlign offers an efficient and effective solution for aligning diffusion models with human preferences, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance but often fail to generate outputs that align with human preferences and intentions, resulting in images with poor aesthetic quality and semantic inconsistencies. Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking. We evaluate HyperAlign on multiple extended generative paradigms, including Stable Diffusion and FLUX. It significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysicsMind is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate MLLMs and video world models on their grasp of fundamental physics principles like Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law, revealing gaps despite advances in other reasoning areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for assessing physical reasoning in multimodal models are fragmented and often tangential, relying on synthetic data or perceptual quality. PhysicsMind addresses this by providing a unified benchmark with real and simulated environments.

Method: PhysicsMind evaluates models through two tasks: Visual Question Answering (VQA) to test reasoning about physical quantities from images/videos, and Video Generation (VG) to assess adherence to physical laws in motion trajectories.

Result: Current models often rely on appearance heuristics and violate basic mechanics, indicating insufficient scaling and training for robust physical understanding.

Conclusion: PhysicsMind serves as a focused testbed to improve physics-aware multimodal models, highlighting the need for better training approaches to enhance physical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Modern foundational Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video world models have advanced significantly in mathematical, common-sense, and visual reasoning, but their grasp of the underlying physics remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models. Our data will be released upon acceptance.

### [50] [Keyframe-Based Feed-Forward Visual Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16020)
*Weichen Dai,Wenhan Su,Da Kong,Yuhang Ming,Wanzeng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel keyframe-based feed-forward visual odometry method using reinforcement learning improves efficiency and accuracy over traditional methods by adaptively selecting keyframes aligned with foundation model characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation model-based visual odometry methods lack efficiency due to indiscriminate processing of image sequences, leading to redundancy and performance degradation from low inter-frame parallax.

Method: The proposed approach integrates reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy, replacing hand-crafted rules with data-driven selection tailored to the foundation model's characteristics.

Result: Trained on TartanAir and tested on real-world datasets, the method shows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward visual odometry techniques.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning-based keyframe selection effectively enhances performance by addressing redundancy and leveraging the foundation model's strengths.

Abstract: The emergence of visual foundation models has revolutionized visual odometry~(VO) and SLAM, enabling pose estimation and dense reconstruction within a single feed-forward network. However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.

*Rongze Ma,Mengkang Lu,Zhenyu Xiang,Yongsheng Pan,Yicheng Wu,Qingjie Zeng,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAINT proposes a structure-first approach for virtual IHC, outperforming existing methods by using a Spatial Structural Start Map for deterministic synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Virtual IHC is cost-effective but challenging due to ambiguous H&E cues and semantic inconsistencies in current methods.

Method: PAINT integrates autoregressive modeling with a structure-first approach using a 3S-Map.

Result: PAINT shows superior structural fidelity and clinical performance on IHC4BC and MIST datasets.

Conclusion: Structure-guided autoregressive modeling enhances virtual IHC synthesis.

Abstract: Virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) aims to computationally synthesize molecular staining patterns from routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) images, offering a cost-effective and tissue-efficient alternative to traditional physical staining. However, this task is particularly challenging: H\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis. Experiments on the IHC4BC and MIST datasets demonstrate that PAINT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural fidelity and clinical downstream tasks, validating the potential of structure-guided autoregressive modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProGiDiff leverages pre-trained diffusion models for medical image segmentation by introducing a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism, enabling multi-class segmentation via natural language prompts and cross-modality adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation methods lack flexibility for human interaction, multi-proposal estimation, and cross-modality adaptation, which diffusion models could address.

Method: ProGiDiff uses a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder to steer a pre-trained diffusion model for segmentation, extending to multi-class settings via prompts.

Result: The framework shows strong performance in CT organ segmentation and can be adapted for MR images through few-shot learning.

Conclusion: ProGiDiff offers a flexible, prompt-driven solution for medical image segmentation, enabling expert-in-the-loop interaction and cross-modality adaptation.

Abstract: Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework is introduced to improve VLA models by dynamically pruning distracting image tokens, enhancing task success rates without altering the model's architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models often focus on irrelevant image tokens ('distracting tokens'), which hinders action generation and task success. The goal is to correct this attention misalignment.

Method: Proposes DTP, a framework that dynamically detects and prunes distracting image tokens to refine visual attention patterns.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in task success rates across various VLA models, with a negative correlation found between success rates and attention to irrelevant regions.

Conclusion: DTP effectively addresses attention misalignment in VLA models, offering a generalizable solution without structural changes, and highlights a common issue for future research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by leveraging the powerful perception abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand environments and directly output actions. However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research.

Motivation: Foundation Models (FMs) face challenges in federated settings due to high computational demands and communication costs, especially in medical image segmentation.

Method: Proposes DSFedMed, utilizing mutual knowledge distillation, synthetic medical images, and learnability-guided sample selection for efficient dual-scale training.

Result: Achieves a 2% average Dice score improvement, reduces communication costs and inference time by nearly 90%.

Conclusion: DSFedMed offers scalable and efficient solutions for resource-limited federated deployments in medical imaging.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across diverse vision tasks. However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines. These results demonstrate significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoRo is a generative masked modeling framework for robust human motion reconstruction from monocular videos under occlusions, achieving real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in reconstructing human motion from monocular videos, especially under occlusions, with applications in AR/VR, robotics, and digital content creation. Existing methods compromise between robustness and efficiency.

Method: MoRo uses masked modeling for motion recovery, integrating multi-modal priors: trajectory-aware motion, image-conditioned pose, and a video-conditioned masked transformer, trained on heterogeneous datasets.

Result: MoRo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and realism under occlusions, matches performance in non-occluded cases, and runs at 70 FPS on a single GPU.

Conclusion: MoRo provides an efficient, occlusion-robust solution for human motion reconstruction, combining generative masked modeling with multi-modal learning for real-time, high-quality results.

Abstract: Human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and digital content creation, but remains challenging under frequent occlusions in real-world settings.Existing regression-based methods are efficient but fragile to missing observations, while optimization- and diffusion-based approaches improve robustness at the cost of slow inference speed and heavy preprocessing steps. To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) face scalability challenges due to complex encoders, specialized decoders, and incompatible training objectives.

Method: SAMTok converts region masks into tokens, allowing MLLMs to learn pixel-wise tasks via next-token prediction and reinforcement learning, without modifying their architecture.

Result: SAMTok achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks like region captioning, VQA, and segmentation, with efficient reinforcement learning improving mask generation.

Conclusion: SAMTok provides a scalable and simple solution for integrating pixel-wise capabilities into MLLMs, demonstrated by strong performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Pixel-wise capabilities are essential for building interactive intelligent systems. However, pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remain difficult to scale due to complex region-level encoders, specialized segmentation decoders, and incompatible training objectives. To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a scalable and straightforward paradigm for equipping MLLMs with strong pixel-wise capabilities. Our code and models are available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CIR benchmarks lack diversity and fail to represent real-world scenarios. EDIR aims to bridge this gap by offering a broader, more controlled set of queries.

Method: The authors use image editing to synthesize queries across diverse categories, constructing EDIR with 5,000 queries hierarchically structured into categories. They evaluate 13 multimodal embedding models.

Result: Even top models struggle with EDIR's diversity, exposing modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage in existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: EDIR is a rigorous benchmark highlighting challenges in CIR. Targeted data can address some issues, but others require architectural improvements.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a pivotal and complex task in multimodal understanding. Current CIR benchmarks typically feature limited query categories and fail to capture the diverse requirements of real-world scenarios. To bridge this evaluation gap, we leverage image editing to achieve precise control over modification types and content, enabling a pipeline for synthesizing queries across a broad spectrum of categories. Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage. Furthermore, an in-domain training experiment demonstrates the feasibility of our benchmark. This experiment clarifies the task challenges by distinguishing between categories that are solvable with targeted data and those that expose intrinsic limitations of current model architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods for AI-generated images in pixel space are computationally expensive and may introduce visual artifacts, prompting the exploration of latent space solutions.

Method: DistSeal trains post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models, which can be distilled into the generative model or its latent decoder for in-model watermarking.

Result: Latent watermarks achieve competitive robustness, similar imperceptibility, and up to 20x speedup over pixel-space baselines, with distillation outperforming pixel-space methods.

Conclusion: Latent space watermarking via DistSeal is a more efficient and robust solution for watermarking AI-generated images compared to traditional pixel-space approaches.

Abstract: Existing approaches for watermarking AI-generated images often rely on post-hoc methods applied in pixel space, introducing computational overhead and potential visual artifacts. In this work, we explore latent space watermarking and introduce DistSeal, a unified approach for latent watermarking that works across both diffusion and autoregressive models. Our approach works by training post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models. We demonstrate that these latent watermarkers can be effectively distilled either into the generative model itself or into the latent decoder, enabling in-model watermarking. The resulting latent watermarks achieve competitive robustness while offering similar imperceptibility and up to 20x speedup compared to pixel-space baselines. Our experiments further reveal that distilling latent watermarkers outperforms distilling pixel-space ones, providing a solution that is both more efficient and more robust.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActionMesh introduces a generative model for producing high-quality, animated 3D meshes quickly and efficiently using temporal 3D diffusion and a temporal autoencoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating animated 3D objects are limited by slow runtime, restrictive setups, or low quality, making them impractical for real-world use.

Method: The approach combines a modified 3D diffusion model with a temporal axis (temporal 3D diffusion) and a temporal 3D autoencoder to convert independent shapes into deformations of a reference shape, creating animations.

Result: ActionMesh achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy and temporal consistency on benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse), offering fast, high-quality animated 3D meshes.

Conclusion: ActionMesh enables rapid, production-ready animation of 3D meshes from various inputs, with superior speed and quality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Generating animated 3D objects is at the heart of many applications, yet most advanced works are typically difficult to apply in practice because of their limited setup, their long runtime, or their limited quality. We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes "in action" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed "temporal 3D diffusion". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 360Anything is a geometry-free framework using diffusion transformers for seamless perspective-to-360° image/video conversion without camera metadata, achieving SOTA results and addressing ERP boundary artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on explicit geometric alignment requiring camera metadata, limiting applicability to in-the-wild data. A geometry-free, data-driven approach is needed.

Method: 360Anything uses pre-trained diffusion transformers, treating inputs/outputs as token sequences to learn the mapping without camera info, and introduces Circular Latent Encoding to resolve ERP boundary artifacts.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance in perspective-to-360° generation, outperforms methods using ground-truth camera info, and shows competitive zero-shot camera FoV/orientation estimation.

Conclusion: 360Anything offers a robust, metadata-free solution for immersive 3D world generation with broader utility in vision tasks.

Abstract: Lifting perspective images and videos to 360° panoramas enables immersive 3D world generation. Existing approaches often rely on explicit geometric alignment between the perspective and the equirectangular projection (ERP) space. Yet, this requires known camera metadata, obscuring the application to in-the-wild data where such calibration is typically absent or noisy. We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers. By treating the perspective input and the panorama target simply as token sequences, 360Anything learns the perspective-to-equirectangular mapping in a purely data-driven way, eliminating the need for camera information. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360° generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks.

TL;DR: RAEs outperform VAEs in large-scale T2I generation, showing faster convergence, better quality, and stability. Scaling simplifies RAE design, and shared representation space enables multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) can scale effectively for large-scale, freeform text-to-image generation, building on their success in ImageNet diffusion modeling.

Method: Scale RAE decoders with a frozen SigLIP-2 encoder using diverse data. Simplify RAE design by testing critical components like noise scheduling. Compare RAEs with FLUX VAEs across parameter scales (0.5B to 9.8B).

Result: RAEs outperform VAEs consistently in pretraining and finetuning, avoiding catastrophic overfitting. Simplified RAEs achieve faster convergence and better generation quality.

Conclusion: RAEs are a simpler, stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation, with potential for unified multimodal models due to shared representation space.

Abstract: Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) have shown distinct advantages in diffusion modeling on ImageNet by training in high-dimensional semantic latent spaces. In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer, improves video reconstruction, text-to-video generation, and zero-shot transfer by learning structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions with deep language supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video tokenizers suffer from limited vocabularies, shallow language supervision, and poor cross-modal alignment, hindering performance in tasks like text-to-video generation and video understanding.

Method: PyraTok uses a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language-aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module to discretize encoder features at multiple depths with a shared binary codebook, optimizing multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective.

Result: PyraTok achieves SOTA video reconstruction, enhances text-to-video quality, and sets new benchmarks in zero-shot tasks like video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling up to 4K/8K resolutions.

Conclusion: PyraTok's pyramidal tokenization framework effectively addresses limitations of single-scale tokenizers, demonstrating superior performance and scalability for video generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: Discrete video VAEs underpin modern text-to-video generation and video understanding systems, yet existing tokenizers typically learn visual codebooks at a single scale with limited vocabularies and shallow language supervision, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and zero-shot transfer. We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.

*Geo Ahn,Inwoong Lee,Taeoh Kim,Minho Shim,Dongyoon Wee,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies object-driven verb shortcuts as a key failure mode in Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models and proposes RCORE, a framework to enforce grounded verb learning, improving unseen composition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZS-CAR models fail due to overlooked object-driven verb shortcuts, leading to overfitting on co-occurrence statistics instead of achieving robust compositional generalization.

Method: The authors propose RCORE, featuring composition-aware augmentation to diversify verb-object pairs and a temporal order regularization loss to penalize shortcuts.

Result: RCORE improves unseen composition accuracy across Sth-com and EK100-com benchmarks, reduces co-occurrence bias, and achieves positive compositional gaps.

Conclusion: Addressing object-driven shortcuts is crucial for robust CVU, and RCORE effectively mitigates this issue.

Abstract: We study Compositional Video Understanding (CVU), where models must recognize verbs and objects and compose them to generalize to unseen combinations. We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.

*Wenhang Ge,Guibao Shen,Jiawei Feng,Luozhou Wang,Hao Lu,Xingye Tian,Xin Tao,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder to improve video-camera alignment by decoding video latent into 3D representations, optimizing pixel-level consistency, and addressing challenges like reward model capacity and computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in camera-controlled video diffusion models, camera controllability remains limited. The paper aims to enhance this by leveraging Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL) while addressing its current challenges.

Method: The authors propose a camera-aware 3D decoder that converts video latent into 3D Gaussians, using camera poses for projection. They optimize pixel-level consistency between rendered views and ground truth, incorporating a visibility term for stochastic regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks confirm the method's effectiveness in improving video-camera alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses limitations of existing ReFL methods, enhancing camera controllability and video-camera alignment through innovative 3D decoding and reward optimization techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in camera-controlled video diffusion models have significantly improved video-camera alignment. However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MALTopic is a multi-agent LLM framework addressing limitations of traditional topic modeling by integrating structured data and improving topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling methods often ignore structured survey data and produce abstract topics requiring extensive human interpretation.

Method: MALTopic decomposes topic modeling into specialized tasks handled by LLM agents: enrichment (using structured data), topic modeling (extracting themes), and deduplication (refining results).

Result: MALTopic outperforms LDA and BERTopic in coherence, diversity, and interpretability on survey datasets.

Conclusion: MALTopic provides a more effective solution for analyzing complex survey data by integrating structured data and leveraging LLM agents.

Abstract: Topic modeling is a crucial technique for extracting latent themes from unstructured text data, particularly valuable in analyzing survey responses. However, traditional methods often only consider free-text responses and do not natively incorporate structured or categorical survey responses for topic modeling. And they produce abstract topics, requiring extensive human interpretation. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Agent LLM Topic Modeling Framework (MALTopic). This framework decomposes topic modeling into specialized tasks executed by individual LLM agents: an enrichment agent leverages structured data to enhance textual responses, a topic modeling agent extracts latent themes, and a deduplication agent refines the results. Comparative analysis on a survey dataset demonstrates that MALTopic significantly improves topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability compared to LDA and BERTopic. By integrating structured data and employing a multi-agent approach, MALTopic generates human-readable topics with enhanced contextual relevance, offering a more effective solution for analyzing complex survey data.

TL;DR: Entropy-Tree is a tree-based decoding method that uses entropy for branching decisions, improving reasoning accuracy and calibration in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding strategies lack efficiency in exploring uncertain positions, leading to redundant or blind exploration in reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes Entropy-Tree, a method that expands the search tree only where model uncertainty is high, using entropy as a branching signal.

Result: Outperforms Multi-chain in pass@k across models and datasets, and shows better AUROC with predictive entropy.

Conclusion: Entropy-Tree combines structured exploration and uncertainty estimation effectively in a single decoding process.

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong reasoning performance, yet existing decoding strategies either explore blindly (random sampling) or redundantly (independent multi-sampling). We propose Entropy-Tree, a tree-based decoding method that exploits entropy as a signal for branching decisions--expanding the search tree only at positions where the model exhibits genuine uncertainty. Entropy-Tree shows superior accuracy and calibration in reasoning tasks: it achieves better pass@k than Multi-chain across multiple models and datasets, and its predictive entropy demonstrates better AUROC compared to several traditional metrics. Entropy-Tree unifies efficient structured exploration and reliable uncertainty estimation within a single decoding procedure.

TL;DR: AfriEconQA is a new benchmark dataset for African economic analysis, derived from World Bank reports. It features complex QA tasks requiring numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation, challenging current IR and LLM systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of specialized benchmarks for African economic analysis and test the limitations of existing IR and LLM systems in handling domain-specific queries.

Method: The dataset includes 8,937 QA instances from World Bank reports, validated for evidence-answer alignment. Benchmarking involves zero-shot and RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B with various embeddings.

Result: Zero-shot models fail on 90% of queries, and RAG pipelines struggle with precision, highlighting a knowledge gap.

Conclusion: AfriEconQA is a robust benchmark for advancing domain-specific IR and RAG systems, with plans to release the dataset and code publicly.

Abstract: We introduce AfriEconQA, a specialized benchmark dataset for African economic analysis grounded in a comprehensive corpus of 236 World Bank reports. The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies. Our results demonstrate a severe parametric knowledge gap, where zero-shot models fail to answer over 90 percent of queries, and even state-of-the-art RAG pipelines struggle to achieve high precision. This confirms AfriEconQA as a robust and challenging benchmark for the next generation of domain-specific IR and RAG systems. The AfriEconQA dataset and code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the impact of text preprocessing on knowledge graph quality, which affects retrofitting effectiveness. Poor preprocessing leads to degraded performance, while improved preprocessing enhances results significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses how annotation artifacts in real-world corpora degrade knowledge graph quality, impacting the effectiveness of embedding retrofitting techniques.

Method: A data engineering framework is presented to mitigate data quality degradation caused by annotation artifacts, such as hashtags, which inflate knowledge graph density.

Result: On noisy graphs, retrofitting techniques degrade performance (−3.5% to −5.2%). After preprocessing, EWMA retrofitting improves performance by +6.2%, with higher gains (+33.8%) for quantitative synthesis questions.

Conclusion: Preprocessing quality is the primary factor in retrofitting success, outweighing algorithmic differences.

Abstract: Embedding retrofitting adjusts pre-trained word vectors using knowledge graph constraints to improve domain-specific retrieval. However, the effectiveness of retrofitting depends critically on knowledge graph quality, which in turn depends on text preprocessing. This paper presents a data engineering framework that addresses data quality degradation from annotation artifacts in real-world corpora.
  The analysis shows that hashtag annotations inflate knowledge graph density, leading to creating spurious edges that corrupt the retrofitting objective. On noisy graphs, all retrofitting techniques produce statistically significant degradation ($-3.5\%$ to $-5.2\%$, $p<0.05$). After preprocessing, \acrshort{ewma} retrofitting achieves $+6.2\%$ improvement ($p=0.0348$) with benefits concentrated in quantitative synthesis questions ($+33.8\%$ average). The gap between clean and noisy preprocessing (10\%+ swing) exceeds the gap between algorithms (3\%), establishing preprocessing quality as the primary determinant of retrofitting success.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes performance degradation in LLMs like Qwen2.5-7B when processing long contexts, identifying critical thresholds and proposing mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address catastrophic performance drops in LLMs when handling long-context tasks, which hinder long-context applications.

Method: Natural length distribution analysis, critical threshold determination via experiments, and development of a unified framework to explain degradation patterns.

Result: Identified a critical threshold (40-50% of max context length) for Qwen2.5-7B, where performance drops by 45.5%, and proposed a framework for mitigation.

Conclusion: This study systematically characterizes intelligence degradation in Qwen models, offering practical guidance for long-context LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit catastrophic performance degradation when processing contexts approaching certain critical thresholds, even when information remains relevant. This intelligence degradation-defined as over 30% drop in task performance-severely limits long-context applications. This degradation shows a common pattern: models maintain strong performance up to a critical threshold, then collapse catastrophically. We term this shallow long-context adaptation-models adapt for short to medium contexts but fail beyond critical thresholds. This paper presents three contributions: (1) Natural Length Distribution Analysis: We use each sample's natural token length without truncation or padding, providing stronger causal evidence that degradation results from context length itself. (2) Critical Threshold Determination: Through experiments on a mixed dataset (1,000 samples covering 5%-95% of context length), we identify the critical threshold for Qwen2.5-7B at 40-50% of maximum context length, where F1 scores drop from 0.55-0.56 to 0.3 (45.5% degradation), using five-method cross-validation. (3) Unified Framework: We consolidate shallow adaptation, explaining degradation patterns and providing a foundation for mitigation strategies. This work provides the first systematic characterization of intelligence degradation in open-source Qwen models, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in long-context scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of LLMs has increased the need for reliable AI text detection, but current detectors fail outside controlled benchmarks.

Method: Evaluates two paradigms (training-free and supervised), proposes a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) framework for discriminative style embeddings.

Result: Supervised detectors perform well in-domain but degrade out-of-domain; training-free methods are sensitive to proxy choice.

Conclusion: The study exposes fundamental challenges in building domain-agnostic detectors and offers code for further research.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLMs has increased the need for reliable AI text detection, yet existing detectors often fail outside controlled benchmarks. We systematically evaluate 2 dominant paradigms (training-free and supervised) and show that both are brittle under distribution shift, unseen generators, and simple stylistic perturbations. To address these limitations, we propose a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) framework that learns discriminative style embeddings. Experiments show that while supervised detectors excel in-domain, they degrade sharply out-of-domain, and training-free methods remain highly sensitive to proxy choice. Overall, our results expose fundamental challenges in building domain-agnostic detectors. Our code is available at: https://github.com/HARSHITJAIS14/DetectAI

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICPO improves LLMs' handling of ambiguous instructions in multi-turn conversations by focusing on the user's intent and rewarding clarification-seeking behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to recover from incorrect assumptions in ambiguous conversations, worsened by standard post-training methods that reward overconfidence.

Method: Proposes ICPO, a training framework that sensitizes models to ambiguity by augmenting the corpus with underspecified prompts and conditioning rewards on the user's intent.

Result: ICPO improves multi-turn conversation performance by 75% while maintaining single-turn benchmark performance, fostering better interaction handling.

Conclusion: ICPO offers a practical way to enhance conversational AI's robustness and collaboration in nuanced human interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn conversations often suffer from a ``lost-in-conversation'' phenomenon, where they struggle to recover from early incorrect assumptions, particularly when users provide ambiguous initial instructions. We find that standard post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exacerbate this issue by rewarding confident, direct answers, thereby inducing overconfidence and discouraging the model from seeking clarification. To address this, we propose Illocution-Calibrated Policy Optimization (ICPO), a novel training framework that sensitizes the model to instruction ambiguity. ICPO augments the training corpus with underspecified prompts and conditions the reward signal on the user's illocutionary intent, rewarding the model for expressing uncertainty or asking for clarification when faced with ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that ICPO fosters appropriate humility, yielding a substantial average improvement of 75\% in multi-turn conversation, while preserving robust performance on single-turn benchmarks. Our work presents a practical path toward more robust and collaborative conversational AI that can better navigate the nuances of human interaction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a resource-efficient adversarial prompting method for LLMs by reusing pre-trained adversarial prompts, reducing computational costs while maintaining effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks and the impracticality of computationally expensive methods like GCG for organizations with limited resources.

Method: Proposes matching new prompts to a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts instead of retraining, evaluated on Llama 3 8B with GCG, PEZ, and GBDA.

Result: Shows a correlation between prompt type and algorithm effectiveness, achieving competitive attack success rates with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable, practical framework for red-teaming and security evaluation of LLMs, even without access to model internals.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised security concerns due to their susceptibility to producing harmful or policy-violating outputs when exposed to adversarial prompts. While alignment and guardrails mitigate common misuse, they remain vulnerable to automated jailbreaking methods such as GCG, PEZ, and GBDA, which generate adversarial suffixes via training and gradient-based search. Although effective, these methods particularly GCG are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for organisations with constrained resources. This paper introduces a resource-efficient adversarial prompting approach that eliminates the need for retraining by matching new prompts to a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts. A dataset of 1,000 prompts was classified into seven harm-related categories, and GCG, PEZ, and GBDA were evaluated on a Llama 3 8B model to identify the most effective attack method per category. Results reveal a correlation between prompt type and algorithm effectiveness. By retrieving semantically similar successful adversarial prompts, the proposed method achieves competitive attack success rates with significantly reduced computational cost. This work provides a practical framework for scalable red-teaming and security evaluation of aligned LLMs, including in settings where model internals are inaccessible.

### [73] [No Reliable Evidence of Self-Reported Sentience in Small Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15334)
*Caspar Kaiser,Sean Enderby*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates whether language models believe themselves to be sentient by querying them and analyzing their responses with classifiers. Results show models consistently deny sentience, and classifiers support these denials as truthful. Larger models deny sentience more confidently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to empirically test whether language models believe they are sentient, addressing a gap in understanding their self-awareness.

Method: Researchers queried models (Qwen, Llama, GPT-OSS) about consciousness, trained classifiers on internal activations to verify responses, and compared results across model sizes.

Result: Models consistently denied sentience, classifiers found no evidence of untruthful denials, and larger models denied sentience more confidently.

Conclusion: Contrary to some beliefs, models do not harbor latent consciousness beliefs, affirming their denials as genuine.

Abstract: Whether language models possess sentience has no empirical answer. But whether they believe themselves to be sentient can, in principle, be tested. We do so by querying several open-weights models about their own consciousness, and then verifying their responses using classifiers trained on internal activations. We draw upon three model families (Qwen, Llama, GPT-OSS) ranging from 0.6 billion to 70 billion parameters, approximately 50 questions about consciousness and subjective experience, and three classification methods from the interpretability literature. First, we find that models consistently deny being sentient: they attribute consciousness to humans but not to themselves. Second, classifiers trained to detect underlying beliefs - rather than mere outputs - provide no clear evidence that these denials are untruthful. Third, within the Qwen family, larger models deny sentience more confidently than smaller ones. These findings contrast with recent work suggesting that models harbour latent beliefs in their own consciousness.

TL;DR: Knowledge Distillation (KD) reduces training data memorization by over 50% compared to fine-tuning, with predictable memorization patterns and notable differences between hard and soft distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand memorization dynamics in KD setups, exploring its potential as a privacy-preserving mechanism and comparing it to standard fine-tuning.

Method: Analyzed memorization across KD pipelines using three LLM families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2), evaluating memorization predictability via zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity.

Result: Distilled models memorize 50% less data than fine-tuned ones; certain examples dominate memorization (~95%). Hard distillation inherits 2.7× more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation.

Conclusion: KD offers better generalization and lower memorization risks than fine-tuning, with hard distillation posing higher risks.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is increasingly adopted to transfer capabilities from large language models to smaller ones, offering significant improvements in efficiency and utility while often surpassing standard fine-tuning. Beyond performance, KD is also explored as a privacy-preserving mechanism to mitigate the risk of training data leakage. While training data memorization has been extensively studied in standard pre-training and fine-tuning settings, its dynamics in a knowledge distillation setup remain poorly understood. In this work, we study memorization across the KD pipeline using three large language model (LLM) families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2). We find: (1) distilled models memorize significantly less training data than standard fine-tuning (reducing memorization by more than 50%); (2) some examples are inherently easier to memorize and account for a large fraction of memorization during distillation (over ~95%); (3) student memorization is predictable prior to distillation using features based on zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity; and (4) while soft and hard distillation have similar overall memorization rates, hard distillation poses a greater risk: it inherits $2.7\times$ more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation. Overall, we demonstrate that distillation can provide both improved generalization and reduced memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.

### [75] [Beyond Fixed Psychological Personas: State Beats Trait, but Language Models are State-Blind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15395)
*Tamunotonye Harry,Ivoline Ngong,Chima Nweke,Yuanyuan Feng,Joseph Near*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Chameleon dataset, highlighting the importance of user state (context) in interactions, unlike existing datasets that focus only on traits. It reveals LLMs' state-blindness and inconsistent reward model responses to user state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing persona datasets, which ignore user state (context) in interactions, by introducing a dataset that captures both trait and state.

Method: Created the Chameleon dataset with 5,001 contextual psychological profiles from 1,667 Reddit users, analyzed using Latent State-Trait theory, and evaluated LLM and reward model behaviors.

Result: 74% of variance is state-driven (within-person), LLMs are state-blind, and reward models react inconsistently to user state.

Conclusion: The Chameleon dataset enables research on affective computing, personalized dialogue, and RLHF alignment by capturing both trait and state dynamics.

Abstract: User interactions with language models vary due to static properties of the user (trait) and the specific context of the interaction (state). However, existing persona datasets (like PersonaChat, PANDORA etc.) capture only trait, and ignore the impact of state. We introduce Chameleon, a dataset of 5,001 contextual psychological profiles from 1,667 Reddit users, each measured across multiple contexts. Using the Chameleon dataset, we present three key findings. First, inspired by Latent State-Trait theory, we decompose variance and find that 74\% is within-person(state) while only 26\% is between-person (trait). Second, we find that LLMs are state-blind: they focus on trait only, and produce similar responses regardless of state. Third, we find that reward models react to user state, but inconsistently: different models favor or penalize the same users in opposite directions. We release Chameleon to support research on affective computing, personalized dialogue, and RLHF alignment.

### [76] [Domain-Specific Knowledge Graphs in RAG-Enhanced Healthcare LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15429)
*Sydney Anuyah,Mehedi Mahmud Kaushik,Hao Dai,Rakesh Shiradkar,Arjan Durresi,Sunandan Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how domain-specific knowledge graphs (KGs) enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in healthcare, finding that precise scope-matched retrieval improves accuracy, while broader graph unions can introduce noise. Larger LLMs often perform well without RAG, while smaller models benefit more from targeted retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating trustworthy, domain-specific reasoning by evaluating whether domain-specific knowledge graphs can improve the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in healthcare.

Method: The researchers constructed three PubMed-derived knowledge graphs (KGs) for specific healthcare domains and tested seven instruction-tuned LLMs using two probes targeting different aspects of the KGs. They evaluated performance across various retrieval sources and decoding temperatures.

Result: Results indicate that precise, scope-matched retrieval (e.g., using $ℕ2$) yields consistent gains, while broader graph unions often reduce accuracy by introducing distractors. Larger models sometimes outperform KG-RAG without retrieval, whereas smaller models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature variations had minimal impact.

Conclusion: The study concludes that precision-focused, scope-matched KG-RAG is more effective than breadth-first approaches. Practical guidelines are provided for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent answers but can struggle with trustworthy, domain-specific reasoning. We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\mathbb{G}_1$, $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_3$, $\mathbb{G}_1$+$\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

### [77] [Chunking, Retrieval, and Re-ranking: An Empirical Evaluation of RAG Architectures for Policy Document Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15457)
*Anuj Maharjan,Umesh Yadav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs for public health policy, showing Advanced RAG outperforms baseline models in faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' hallucinations in high-stakes public health policy by grounding outputs in authoritative documents.

Method: Compares Vanilla LLM, Basic RAG, and Advanced RAG (with cross-encoder re-ranking) using Mistral-7B and embeddings, testing chunking strategies.

Result: Advanced RAG achieves higher faithfulness (0.797) than Basic RAG (0.621) and Vanilla LLM (0.347), but document segmentation limits reasoning.

Conclusion: Advanced RAG improves precision for policy QA, though document segmentation remains a challenge.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the public health policy sector offers a transformative approach to navigating the vast repositories of regulatory guidance maintained by agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797. These results demonstrate that two-stage retrieval mechanisms are essential for achieving the precision required for domain-specific policy question answering, though structural constraints in document segmentation remain a significant bottleneck for multi-step reasoning tasks.

*Sydney Anuyah,Sneha Shajee-Mohan,Ankit-Singh Chauhan,Sunandan Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates 13 open-source LLMs on pairwise causal discovery (PCD) tasks, revealing significant performance gaps in causal detection and extraction, especially for complex cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of LLMs to reason about cause and effect, crucial for safe deployment in high-stakes fields like biomedicine.

Method: Tested models on 12 diverse datasets using various prompting methods (zero-shot, CoT, FICL) for causal detection and extraction.

Result: Best models scored 49.57% (detection) and 47.12% (extraction), struggling with complex scenarios like implicit relationships and multi-sentence links.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack robustness for causal reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for further research.

Abstract: The safe deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes fields like biomedicine, requires them to be able to reason about cause and effect. We investigate this ability by testing 13 open-source LLMs on a fundamental task: pairwise causal discovery (PCD) from text. Our benchmark, using 12 diverse datasets, evaluates two core skills: 1) \textbf{Causal Detection} (identifying if a text contains a causal link) and 2) \textbf{Causal Extraction} (pulling out the exact cause and effect phrases). We tested various prompting methods, from simple instructions (zero-shot) to more complex strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-shot In-Context Learning (FICL).
  The results show major deficiencies in current models. The best model for detection, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, only achieved a mean score of 49.57\% ($C_{detect}$), while the best for extraction, Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, reached just 47.12\% ($C_{extract}$). Models performed best on simple, explicit, single-sentence relations. However, performance plummeted for more difficult (and realistic) cases, such as implicit relationships, links spanning multiple sentences, and texts containing multiple causal pairs. We provide a unified evaluation framework, built on a dataset validated with high inter-annotator agreement ($κ\ge 0.758$), and make all our data, code, and prompts publicly available to spur further research. \href{https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}{Code available here: https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}

*Yuxing Chen,Guoqing Luo,Zijun Wu,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Persona Thinking (MPT), an inference-time framework that reduces bias in LLMs by using dialectical reasoning from multiple perspectives, achieving lower bias without harming reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show harmful social biases, necessitating methods to mitigate stereotypes and unfair outcomes.

Method: MPT employs dialectical reasoning with contrasting social identities (e.g., male, female, neutral) iteratively to expose and correct biases.

Result: MPT outperforms existing methods on bias benchmarks, achieving the lowest bias while preserving reasoning ability.

Conclusion: MPT effectively reduces bias in LLMs by leveraging multi-perspective reasoning, offering a robust solution for fairness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant social biases that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and unfair outcomes. In this paper, we propose Multi-Persona Thinking (MPT), a novel inference-time framework that leverages dialectical reasoning from multiple perspectives to reduce bias. MPT guides models to adopt contrasting social identities (e.g., male and female) along with a neutral viewpoint, and then engages these personas iteratively to expose and correct biases. Through a dialectical reasoning process, the framework transforms the potential weakness of persona assignment into a strength for bias mitigation. We evaluate MPT on two widely used bias benchmarks across both open-source and closed-source models of varying scales. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing prompting-based strategies: MPT achieves the lowest bias while maintaining core reasoning ability.

*Jason Chuan-Chih Chou,Abhinav Kumar,Shivank Garg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fractal ViT variant that breaks token permutation invariance using attention masks with summary tokens, similar to registers, but finds no improvement over standard ViT with registers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by transformers performing well without positional encoding (NoPE) and registers improving ViTs, the study explores a fractal ViT variant.

Method: The fractal ViT applies attention masks between regular tokens and summary tokens (like registers), tested with/without positional encodings.

Result: The fractal ViT does not outperform standard ViT with registers, suggesting the findings may be scale, domain, or application-specific.

Conclusion: The results indicate that the effectiveness of such modifications may depend on specific contexts rather than universally.

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from recent findings including surprisingly decent performance of transformers without positional encoding (NoPE) in the domain of language models and how registers (additional throwaway tokens not tied to input) may improve the performance of large vision transformers (ViTs), we invent and test a variant of ViT called fractal ViT that breaks permutation invariance among the tokens by applying an attention mask between the regular tokens and ``summary tokens'' similar to registers, in isolation or in combination with various positional encodings. These models do not improve upon ViT with registers, highlighting the fact that these findings may be scale, domain, or application-specific.

*Haaris Mian,Melanie Subbiah,Sharon Marcus,Nora Shaalan,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a six-component structural model for analyzing characters in novels, focusing on narrator-character distinction and discussion by other characters, using LLMs and task-specific transformers on 19th-century British novels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional character modeling, which focuses heavily on main characters, by incorporating a more comprehensive literary theory-based approach.

Method: The study utilizes general-purpose LLMs and task-specific transformers to analyze character discussion in 19th-century British realist novels, creating component-level and graph representations.

Result: The new model enables large-scale exploration of literary theories, such as character centrality and gendered dynamics in character discussion.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a novel computational approach to character analysis, allowing deeper literary insights.

Abstract: Characters in novels have typically been modeled based on their presence in scenes in narrative, considering aspects like their actions, named mentions, and dialogue. This conception of character places significant emphasis on the main character who is present in the most scenes. In this work, we instead adopt a framing developed from a new literary theory proposing a six-component structural model of character. This model enables a comprehensive approach to character that accounts for the narrator-character distinction and includes a component neglected by prior methods, discussion by other characters. We compare general-purpose LLMs with task-specific transformers for operationalizing this model of character on major 19th-century British realist novels. Our methods yield both component-level and graph representations of character discussion. We then demonstrate that these representations allow us to approach literary questions at scale from a new computational lens. Specifically, we explore Woloch's classic "the one vs the many" theory of character centrality and the gendered dynamics of character discussion.

*Adam Szelestey,Sofie van Engelen,Tianhao Huang,Justin Snelders,Qintao Zeng,Songgaojun Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdversaRiskQA is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate adversarial factuality in LLMs across Health, Finance, and Law, revealing model weaknesses and performance trends under misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in LLMs spreads misinformation, reducing public trust, especially in high-risk domains. No existing benchmarks assess adversarial factuality or its impact on long-form text.

Method: AdversaRiskQA includes two difficulty levels and uses automated methods to evaluate adversarial attack success and long-form factuality across six LLMs.

Result: Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest accuracy; GPT-5 performs consistently well. Performance scales non-linearly with size, varies by domain, and long-form factuality shows no significant impact from misinformation.

Conclusion: AdversaRiskQA helps identify LLM weaknesses and guides the development of more reliable models for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains an acute concern, contributing to the spread of misinformation and diminished public trust, particularly in high-risk domains. Among hallucination types, factuality is crucial, as it concerns a model's alignment with established world knowledge. Adversarial factuality, defined as the deliberate insertion of misinformation into prompts with varying levels of expressed confidence, tests a model's ability to detect and resist confidently framed falsehoods. Existing work lacks high-quality, domain-specific resources for assessing model robustness under such adversarial conditions, and no prior research has examined the impact of injected misinformation on long-form text factuality.
  To address this gap, we introduce AdversaRiskQA, the first verified and reliable benchmark systematically evaluating adversarial factuality across Health, Finance, and Law. The benchmark includes two difficulty levels to test LLMs' defensive capabilities across varying knowledge depths. We propose two automated methods for evaluating the adversarial attack success and long-form factuality. We evaluate six open- and closed-source LLMs from the Qwen, GPT-OSS, and GPT families, measuring misinformation detection rates. Long-form factuality is assessed on Qwen3 (30B) under both baseline and adversarial conditions. Results show that after excluding meaningless responses, Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest average accuracy, while GPT-5 maintains consistently high accuracy. Performance scales non-linearly with model size, varies by domains, and gaps between difficulty levels narrow as models grow. Long-form evaluation reveals no significant correlation between injected misinformation and the model's factual output. AdversaRiskQA provides a valuable benchmark for pinpointing LLM weaknesses and developing more reliable models for high-stakes applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Indica is a new benchmark testing LLMs' ability to handle sub-national cultural commonsense in India, revealing regional diversity and model biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether cultural commonsense is uniform or varies at the sub-national level, particularly in India's diverse regions.

Method: Collected 1,630 region-specific QA pairs from five Indian regions across 8 domains, evaluating 8 LLMs.

Result: Only 39.4% of questions had unanimous regional agreement; LLMs showed low accuracy (13.4%-20.9%) and geographic bias.

Conclusion: Cultural commonsense in India is regional, not national, and current LLMs struggle with regional diversity and exhibit biases.

Abstract: Existing cultural commonsense benchmarks treat nations as monolithic, assuming uniform practices within national boundaries. But does cultural commonsense hold uniformly within a nation, or does it vary at the sub-national level? We introduce Indica, the first benchmark designed to test LLMs' ability to address this question, focusing on India - a nation of 28 states, 8 union territories, and 22 official languages. We collect human-annotated answers from five Indian regions (North, South, East, West, and Central) across 515 questions spanning 8 domains of everyday life, yielding 1,630 region-specific question-answer pairs. Strikingly, only 39.4% of questions elicit agreement across all five regions, demonstrating that cultural commonsense in India is predominantly regional, not national. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs and find two critical gaps: models achieve only 13.4%-20.9% accuracy on region-specific questions, and they exhibit geographic bias, over-selecting Central and North India as the "default" (selected 30-40% more often than expected) while under-representing East and West. Beyond India, our methodology provides a generalizable framework for evaluating cultural commonsense in any culturally heterogeneous nation, from question design grounded in anthropological taxonomy, to regional data collection, to bias measurement.

TL;DR: The study explores how LLMs can enhance physician-patient communication by refining written responses for empathy without compromising factual accuracy, introducing new metrics for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical empathy is crucial but challenging to balance with factual precision in practice. This research aims to improve healthcare communication using LLMs.

Method: The study uses LLMs as 'empathy editors' to refine physicians' responses, introducing Empathy Ranking Score and MedFactChecking Score for quantitative assessment.

Result: LLM-edited responses improve empathy perception while maintaining factual accuracy, outperforming fully LLM-generated outputs.

Conclusion: LLMs are safer and more effective as editorial assistants rather than autonomous generators in healthcare communication.

Abstract: Clinical empathy is essential for patient care, but physicians need continually balance emotional warmth with factual precision under the cognitive and emotional constraints of clinical practice. This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can function as empathy editors, refining physicians' written responses to enhance empathetic tone while preserving underlying medical information. More importantly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics, an Empathy Ranking Score and a MedFactChecking Score to systematically assess both emotional and factual quality of the responses. Experimental results show that LLM edited responses significantly increase perceived empathy while preserving factual accuracy compared with fully LLM generated outputs. These findings suggest that using LLMs as editorial assistants, rather than autonomous generators, offers a safer, more effective pathway to empathetic and trustworthy AI-assisted healthcare communication.

TL;DR: YuFeng-XGuard is a reasoning-centric guardrail model family for LLMs, offering multi-dimensional risk assessment with structured predictions, natural language explanations, and dynamic policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety solutions for LLMs lack transparency, flexibility, or efficiency. YuFeng-XGuard aims to provide fine-grained, interpretable, and adaptable risk assessment.

Method: YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions with categories, confidence scores, and explanations. It uses tiered inference for latency balance and dynamic policies for adaptability.

Result: Extensive benchmarks show YuFeng-XGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance with efficient trade-offs.

Conclusion: YuFeng-XGuard is released as an open model family, offering both full-capacity and lightweight versions for diverse deployment scenarios.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, safety guardrails are required to go beyond coarse-grained filtering and support fine-grained, interpretable, and adaptable risk assessment. However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs. We release YuFeng-XGuard as an open model family, including both a full-capacity variant and a lightweight version, to support a wide range of deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) fall short of autoregressive models due to weakened inter-token dependencies but show adaptive decoding behavior and potential in tasks like Sudoku.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MDLMs' parallelism and arbitrary-order decoding capabilities, comparing their performance with autoregressive models.

Method: Evaluate eight MDLMs using Average Finalization Parallelism (AFP) and Kendall's tau across 58 benchmarks in knowledge, reasoning, and programming.

Result: MDLMs lag behind autoregressive models due to dependency issues but adapt decoding strategies based on task demands.

Conclusion: A Generate-then-Edit paradigm is proposed to balance dependency retention with parallel decoding efficiency.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) promise parallel token generation and arbitrary-order decoding, yet it remains unclear to what extent current models truly realize these capabilities. We characterize MDLM behavior along two dimensions -- parallelism strength and generation order -- using Average Finalization Parallelism (AFP) and Kendall's tau. We evaluate eight mainstream MDLMs (up to 100B parameters) on 58 benchmarks spanning knowledge, reasoning, and programming. The results show that MDLMs still lag behind comparably sized autoregressive models, mainly because parallel probabilistic modeling weakens inter-token dependencies. Meanwhile, MDLMs exhibit adaptive decoding behavior: their parallelism and generation order vary significantly with the task domain, the stage of reasoning, and whether the output is correct. On tasks that require "backward information" (e.g., Sudoku), MDLMs adopt a solution order that tends to fill easier Sudoku blanks first, highlighting their advantages. Finally, we provide theoretical motivation and design insights supporting a Generate-then-Edit paradigm, which mitigates dependency loss while retaining the efficiency of parallel decoding.

TL;DR: A hybrid model combining LLM embeddings with traditional ML classifiers improves toxicity detection accuracy on Twitch by incorporating emotes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing scalability and context challenges in moderating toxic behavior on live-streaming platforms like Twitch.

Method: Exploratory comparison of toxicity detection methods, introducing ToxiTwitch—a hybrid model using LLM embeddings and traditional classifiers.

Result: Achieves 80% accuracy with channel-specific training, outperforming BERT by 13%.

Conclusion: Emote-aware toxicity detection shows promise but reveals challenges and limitations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of live-streaming platforms such as Twitch has introduced complex challenges in moderating toxic behavior. Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent). This work is an exploratory study intended to surface challenges and limits of emote-aware toxicity detection on Twitch.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedConf, a framework for assessing confidence in multi-turn medical consultations, highlighting the need for evaluating both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods inadequately assess confidence in dynamic medical consultations, risking misdiagnosis due to incomplete information.

Method: Developed MedConf, a benchmark unifying three medical data types with an information sufficiency gradient, and compared 27 methods.

Result: MedConf outperformed state-of-the-art methods on AUROC and Pearson metrics, excelling in information insufficiency and multimorbidity scenarios.

Conclusion: Information adequacy is crucial for credible medical confidence modeling, advancing reliable and interpretable large medical models.

Abstract: Large-scale language models (LLMs) often offer clinical judgments based on incomplete information, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity. These results demonstrate that information adequacy is a key determinant of credible medical confidence modeling, providing a new pathway toward building more reliable and interpretable large medical models.

*Raymond Xiong,Furong Jia,Lionel Wong,Monica Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the gap between LLM benchmarks, which focus on medical exam questions, and real-life patient questions. Using data from Google's People Also Ask, the study shows that many patient questions contain incorrect assumptions, and current LLMs struggle to identify these errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disconnect between LLM benchmarks and real-world patient questions, particularly focusing on the prevalence of incorrect assumptions in patient queries.

Method: Collected data from Google's People Also Ask by querying top 200 prescribed medications in the U.S., creating a dataset of real-life patient questions.

Result: Many patient questions contain incorrect assumptions; their emergence is non-random and linked to the degree of incorrectness in prior questions. Current LLMs fail to identify these errors effectively.

Conclusion: LLMs need improvement in identifying and addressing incorrect assumptions in real-life patient questions, as current benchmarks do not reflect this challenge.

Abstract: Patients are increasingly using large language models (LLMs) to seek answers to their healthcare-related questions. However, benchmarking efforts in LLMs for question answering often focus on medical exam questions, which differ significantly in style and content from the questions patients actually raise in real life. To bridge this gap, we sourced data from Google's People Also Ask feature by querying the top 200 prescribed medications in the United States, curating a dataset of medical questions people commonly ask. A considerable portion of the collected questions contains incorrect assumptions and dangerous intentions. We demonstrate that the emergence of these corrupted questions is not uniformly random and depends heavily on the degree of incorrectness in the history of questions that led to their appearance. Current LLMs that perform strongly on other benchmarks struggle to identify incorrect assumptions in everyday questions.

### [90] [Persona Switch: Mixing Distinct Perspectives in Decoding Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15708)
*Junseok Kim,Nakyeong Yang,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona Switch dynamically combines zero-shot and role-play prompting by selecting higher-confidence outputs at each step, improving accuracy by up to 5.13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot and role-play prompting have complementary strengths, but their performance is inconsistent.

Method: Proposes Persona Switch, a decoding method that selects better outputs step-by-step using logit gap confidence.

Result: Achieves up to 5.13% accuracy improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: Output confidence is effective for selecting reliable outputs, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Role-play prompting is known to steer the behavior of language models by injecting a persona into the prompt, improving their zero-shot reasoning capabilities. However, such improvements are inconsistent across different tasks or instances. This inconsistency suggests that zero-shot and role-play prompting may offer complementary strengths rather than one being universally superior. Building on this insight, we propose Persona Switch, a novel decoding method that dynamically combines the benefits of both prompting strategies. Our method proceeds step-by-step, selecting the better output between zero-shot and role-play prompting at each step by comparing their output confidence, as measured by the logit gap. Experiments with widely-used LLMs demonstrate that Persona Switch consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to 5.13% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, we show that output confidence serves as an informative measure for selecting the more reliable output.

### [91] [Dancing in Chains: Strategic Persuasion in Academic Rebuttal via Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15715)
*Zhitao He,Zongwei Lyu,Yi R Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RebuttalAgent framework addresses academic rebuttal challenges by integrating Theory of Mind (ToM) through a TSR pipeline, outperforming base and proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Academic rebuttal is complex due to strategic communication under information asymmetry, lacking perspective-taking in current methods.

Method: RebuttalAgent uses a ToM-Strategy-Response pipeline, trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, evaluated by Rebuttal-RM.

Result: RebuttalAgent outperforms base models by 18.3% and proprietary models in automated and human evaluations.

Conclusion: RebuttalAgent enhances academic rebuttals with ToM-based strategies, though it supports rather than replaces authors' responses.

Abstract: Although artificial intelligence (AI) has become deeply integrated into various stages of the research workflow and achieved remarkable advancements, academic rebuttal remains a significant and underexplored challenge. This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

*Ruoqing Zhao,Runze Xia,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KERM framework enhances medical report generation by using knowledge retrieval, purification, and fine-grained rewards to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucinations (plausible but inaccurate claims) in medical report generation by large vision language models (LVLMs).

Method: Uses MedCLIP for knowledge retrieval, a purification module for contextual relevance, and fine-grained rewards to guide LVLMs in generating clinically relevant reports.

Result: Experiments on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets show KERM effectively reduces hallucinations and improves report quality.

Conclusion: KERM successfully mitigates hallucinations in medical report generation, ensuring clinically accurate outputs.

Abstract: In the realm of medical report generation (MRG), the integration of natural language processing has emerged as a vital tool to alleviate the workload of radiologists. Despite the impressive capabilities demonstrated by large vision language models (LVLMs) in understanding natural language, their susceptibility to generating plausible yet inaccurate claims, known as ``hallucinations'', raises concerns-especially in the nuanced and critical field of medical. In this work, we introduce a framework, \textbf{K}nowledge-\textbf{E}nhanced with Fine-Grained \textbf{R}einforced Rewards \textbf{M}edical Report Generation (KERM), to tackle the issue. Our approach refines the input to the LVLM by first utilizing MedCLIP for knowledge retrieval, incorporating relevant lesion fact sentences from a curated knowledge corpus. We then introduce a novel purification module to ensure the retrieved knowledge is contextually relevant to the patient's clinical context. Subsequently, we employ fine-grained rewards to guide these models in generating highly supportive and clinically relevant descriptions, ensuring the alignment of model's outputs with desired behaviors. Experimental results on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating hallucinations and enhancing report quality.

### [93] [Beyond Marginal Distributions: A Framework to Evaluate the Representativeness of Demographic-Aligned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15755)
*Tristan Williams,Franziska Weeber,Sebastian Padó,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes evaluating LLMs' representativeness using multivariate correlations alongside marginal distributions, revealing shortcomings in current steering techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in aligning LLMs with human values by focusing on deeper latent structures beyond independent survey items.

Method: Introduces a framework comparing multivariate correlation patterns and marginal distributions, testing it on persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning against human survey data.

Result: Neither technique fully captures human correlation patterns, though demographic fine-tuning performs better marginally.

Conclusion: Representativeness is distinct from marginal alignment, and ignoring correlations risks overestimating model capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to represent human opinions, values, or beliefs, and their steerability towards these ideals is an active area of research. Existing work focuses predominantly on aligning marginal response distributions, treating each survey item independently. While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns. We conclude that representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment and an evaluation focused on marginals can mask structural failures, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about model capabilities.

*Yuxuan Lei,Tianfu Wang,Jianxun Lian,Zhengyu Hu,Defu Lian,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HumanLLM bridges the gap in LLMs' ability to simulate human behavior by leveraging personalized data and tasks, outperforming base models in predictions and authenticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack nuanced understanding of human cognition, limiting their effectiveness in social simulations and personalized applications due to misalignment with contextual human data.

Method: HumanLLM is trained on the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a curated corpus from real-world user logs, followed by supervised fine-tuning for diverse human behavior prediction tasks.

Result: HumanLLM excels in predicting user actions, mimicking writing styles, and generating authentic profiles, showing generalization gains on social intelligence benchmarks.

Conclusion: HumanLLM significantly enhances the simulation of individualized human behavior and cognition, offering improved accuracy and authenticity over standard LLMs.

Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) in objective tasks like mathematics and coding, there is growing interest in their potential to simulate human behavior--a capability with profound implications for transforming social science research and customer-centric business insights. However, LLMs often lack a nuanced understanding of human cognition and behavior, limiting their effectiveness in social simulation and personalized applications. We posit that this limitation stems from a fundamental misalignment: standard LLM pretraining on vast, uncontextualized web data does not capture the continuous, situated context of an individual's decisions, thoughts, and behaviors over time. To bridge this gap, we introduce HumanLLM, a foundation model designed for personalized understanding and simulation of individuals. We first construct the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a large-scale corpus curated from real-world user data on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Blogger, and Amazon. Through a rigorous, multi-stage pipeline involving data filtering, synthesis, and quality control, we automatically extract over 5.5 million user logs to distill rich profiles, behaviors, and thinking patterns. We then formulate diverse learning tasks and perform supervised fine-tuning to empower the model to predict a wide range of individualized human behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HumanLLM achieves superior performance in predicting user actions and inner thoughts, more accurately mimics user writing styles and preferences, and generates more authentic user profiles compared to base models. Furthermore, HumanLLM shows significant gains on out-of-domain social intelligence benchmarks, indicating enhanced generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Steering multilingual neural metrics toward an English pivot improves correlation with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortage of accurate multilingual evaluation metrics and explore whether aligning metrics with an English pivot enhances performance.

Method: Use encoder- and decoder-based metrics with test-time intervention methods.

Result: Interventions improve metric effectiveness across diverse languages.

Conclusion: Aligning multilingual metrics with an English pivot boosts their accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: An increasing body of work has leveraged multilingual language models for Natural Language Generation tasks such as summarization. A major empirical bottleneck in this area is the shortage of accurate and robust evaluation metrics for many languages, which hinders progress. Recent studies suggest that multilingual language models often use English as an internal pivot language, and that misalignment with this pivot can lead to degraded downstream performance. Motivated by the hypothesis that this mismatch could also apply to multilingual neural metrics, we ask whether steering their activations toward an English pivot can improve correlation with human judgments. We experiment with encoder- and decoder-based metrics and find that test-time intervention methods are effective across the board, increasing metric effectiveness for diverse languages.

TL;DR: ExDR is an Explanation-driven Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework designed to improve multimodal fake news detection by leveraging model-generated explanations, addressing issues like redundant retrieval and irrelevant evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evolving nature of multimodal fake news and its reliance on timely details challenge existing detection methods, necessitating a more efficient and accurate solution.

Method: ExDR integrates model-generated explanations into retrieval triggering and evidence retrieval modules. It assesses triggering confidence, constructs entity-aware indices, and retrieves contrastive evidence based on deception-specific features.

Result: ExDR outperforms previous methods on AMG and MR2 datasets in retrieval triggering accuracy, retrieval quality, and overall detection performance.

Conclusion: ExDR demonstrates effectiveness and generalization capability, offering a promising solution for multimodal fake news detection.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal fake news poses a serious societal threat, as its evolving nature and reliance on timely factual details challenge existing detection methods. Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation provides a promising solution by triggering keyword-based retrieval and incorporating external knowledge, thus enabling both efficient and accurate evidence selection. However, it still faces challenges in addressing issues such as redundant retrieval, coarse similarity, and irrelevant evidence when applied to deceptive content. In this paper, we propose ExDR, an Explanation-driven Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Multimodal Fake News Detection. Our framework systematically leverages model-generated explanations in both the retrieval triggering and evidence retrieval modules. It assesses triggering confidence from three complementary dimensions, constructs entity-aware indices by fusing deceptive entities, and retrieves contrastive evidence based on deception-specific features to challenge the initial claim and enhance the final prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, AMG and MR2, demonstrate that ExDR consistently outperforms previous methods in retrieval triggering accuracy, retrieval quality, and overall detection performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capability.

*Michael Farrell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines if professional translators can distinguish AI-generated Italian short stories from human-written ones without training. Results show mixed accuracy, with some relying on subjective preferences and others on objective markers like low burstiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of professional translators to identify AI-generated content without specialized training, highlighting implications for synthetic-text editing.

Method: An in-person experiment with 69 translators evaluating three anonymized stories (two AI-generated, one human-written), rating AI likelihood and providing justifications.

Result: 16.2% correctly identified AI texts, while others misclassified them. Objective markers (low burstiness) were reliable; subjective impressions led to errors.

Conclusion: Findings suggest challenges in synthetic-text editing, with implications for professional contexts.

Abstract: This study investigates whether professional translators can reliably identify short stories generated in Italian by artificial intelligence (AI) without prior specialized training. Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported. In contrast, features such as grammatical accuracy and emotional tone frequently led to misclassification. These findings raise questions about the role and scope of synthetic-text editing in professional contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates the relationship between training corpus size and vocabulary properties in clinical text classification, finding that 600 documents suffice for optimal performance and vocabulary quality significantly impacts learning curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of justification for sample size requirements in clinical text classification and understand how vocabulary properties influence performance.

Method: Used MIMIC-III dataset with BERT embeddings and Random Forest classifiers, varying training sizes from 100 to 10,000 documents, and analyzed vocabulary properties using Lasso logistic regression.

Result: 600 documents achieved 95% of maximum performance. Strong predictors improved accuracy, while noisy predictors reduced it.

Conclusion: Sample size and vocabulary quality are critical; 600 documents suffice for optimal performance, and vocabulary properties significantly impact accuracy.

Abstract: Introduction: Clinical text classification using natural language processing (NLP) models requires adequate training data to achieve optimal performance. For that, 200-500 documents are typically annotated. The number is constrained by time and costs and lacks justification of the sample size requirements and their relationship to text vocabulary properties.
  Methods: Using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset containing hospital discharge notes with ICD-9 diagnoses as labels, we employed pre-trained BERT embeddings followed by Random Forest classifiers to identify 10 randomly selected diagnoses, varying training corpus sizes from 100 to 10,000 documents, and analyzed vocabulary properties by identifying strong and noisy predictive words through Lasso logistic regression on bag-of-words embeddings.
  Results: Learning curves varied significantly across the 10 classification tasks despite identical preprocessing and algorithms, with 600 documents sufficient to achieve 95% of the performance attainable with 10,000 documents for all tasks. Vocabulary analysis revealed that more strong predictors and fewer noisy predictors were associated with steeper learning curves, where every 100 additional noisy words decreased accuracy by approximately 0.02 while 100 additional strong predictors increased maximum accuracy by approximately 0.04.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AV-HuBERT's response to incongruent audiovisual stimuli closely matches human auditory dominance rates but exceeds human phonetic fusion rates, lacking human perceptual variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the perceptual bio-fidelity of AV-HuBERT in handling incongruent audiovisual stimuli (McGurk effect) compared to human observers.

Method: Benchmarked AV-HuBERT's responses to the McGurk effect against 44 human observers, measuring auditory dominance and phonetic fusion rates.

Result: AV-HuBERT matched human auditory dominance rates (32.0% vs. 31.8%) but exceeded human phonetic fusion rates (68.0% vs. 47.7%). The model lacked human-like perceptual stochasticity.

Conclusion: Self-supervised models like AV-HuBERT replicate multisensory outcomes but miss the neural variability seen in human speech perception.

Abstract: This study evaluates AV-HuBERT's perceptual bio-fidelity by benchmarking its response to incongruent audiovisual stimuli (McGurk effect) against human observers (N=44). Results reveal a striking quantitative isomorphism: AI and humans exhibited nearly identical auditory dominance rates (32.0% vs. 31.8%), suggesting the model captures biological thresholds for auditory resistance. However, AV-HuBERT showed a deterministic bias toward phonetic fusion (68.0%), significantly exceeding human rates (47.7%). While humans displayed perceptual stochasticity and diverse error profiles, the model remained strictly categorical. Findings suggest that current self-supervised architectures mimic multisensory outcomes but lack the neural variability inherent to human speech perception.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Stable-DiffCoder, a diffusion-based code model, outperforms autoregressive counterparts on code benchmarks, offering stable training and improved modeling for code editing, reasoning, and low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based language models for code lag behind autoregressive models despite advantages like non-sequential generation and data reuse. The goal is to bridge this gap.

Method: Stable-DiffCoder uses Seed-Coder's architecture, data, and training pipeline, enhanced with block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT), warmup, and clipped noise schedules for stable training.

Result: Under comparable data and architecture, Stable-DiffCoder outperforms AR models on code benchmarks and achieves better performance than larger models (~8B) with only CPT and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based training can surpass AR training for code modeling, improving structured tasks like editing and reasoning while benefiting low-resource languages through augmentation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (DLLMs) offer non-sequential, block-wise generation and richer data reuse compared to autoregressive (AR) models, but existing code DLLMs still lag behind strong AR baselines under comparable budgets. We revisit this setting in a controlled study and introduce Stable-DiffCoder, a block diffusion code model that reuses the Seed-Coder architecture, data, and training pipeline. To enable efficient knowledge learning and stable training, we incorporate a block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT) stage enhanced by a tailored warmup and block-wise clipped noise schedule. Under the same data and architecture, Stable-DiffCoder overall outperforms its AR counterpart on a broad suite of code benchmarks. Moreover, relying only on the CPT and supervised fine-tuning stages, Stable-DiffCoder achieves stronger performance than a wide range of \~8B ARs and DLLMs, demonstrating that diffusion-based training can improve code modeling quality beyond AR training alone. Moreover, diffusion-based any-order modeling improves structured code modeling for editing and reasoning, and through data augmentation, benefits low-resource coding languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an image-based method using pretrained vision models to decode imagined speech from MEG signals, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-invasive decoding of imagined speech is difficult due to weak signals and limited labeled data.

Method: Transforms MEG signals into time-frequency representations compatible with pretrained vision models.

Result: Achieved 90.4% accuracy for imagery vs. silence, 81.0% vs. silent reading, and 60.6% for vowel decoding.

Conclusion: Pretrained vision models effectively capture imagined speech structure in non-invasive neural signals.

Abstract: Non-invasive decoding of imagined speech remains challenging due to weak, distributed signals and limited labeled data. Our paper introduces an image-based approach that transforms magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals into time-frequency representations compatible with pretrained vision models. MEG data from 21 participants performing imagined speech tasks were projected into three spatial scalogram mixtures via a learnable sensor-space convolution, producing compact image-like inputs for ImageNet-pretrained vision architectures. These models outperformed classical and non-pretrained models, achieving up to 90.4% balanced accuracy for imagery vs. silence, 81.0% vs. silent reading, and 60.6% for vowel decoding. Cross-subject evaluation confirmed that pretrained models capture shared neural representations, and temporal analyses localized discriminative information to imagery-locked intervals. These findings show that pretrained vision models applied to image-based MEG representations can effectively capture the structure of imagined speech in non-invasive neural signals.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create cost-effective, efficient, and high-performing language models tailored for the Turkish legal domain through domain adaptation.

Method: (1) Pre-training bidirectional encoders (ModernBERT) on a Turkish corpus, with checkpoint selection based on retrieval performance. (2) Adapting decoder models (Qwen3) through continual pre-training with curriculum learning.

Result: Encoder models achieved top-3 rankings on the Turkish retrieval leaderboard (92.36% efficiency). Decoder models showed a 36.2% perplexity reduction on legal text.

Conclusion: The Mecellem framework provides a cost-effective, high-performance alternative to multi-stage training pipelines, demonstrating strong domain adaptation for Turkish legal language models.

Abstract: This paper presents Mecellem models, a framework for developing specialized language models for the Turkish legal domain through domain adaptation strategies. We make two contributions: (1)Encoder Model Pre-trained from Scratch: ModernBERT-based bidirectional encoders pre-trained on a Turkish-dominant corpus of 112.7 billion tokens. We implement a checkpoint selection strategy that evaluates downstream retrieval performance throughout training, revealing that optimal checkpoints achieve best retrieval scores before pre-training loss reaches its minimum. Our encoder models achieve top-3 rankings on the Turkish retrieval leaderboard, with smaller models (155M parameters) achieving comparable performance to larger reference models (307M-567M parameters). Our approach achieves 92.36% production efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models (embeddinggemma-300m: 100.00%, BAAI/bge-m3: 99.54%, newmindai/bge-m3-stsb: 94.38%), ranking fourth overall despite requiring less computational resources. SOTA models rely on multi-stage, computationally intensive training pipelines, making our single-stage pre-training followed by efficient post-training approach a cost-effective alternative; (2)Decoder Model with Continual Pre-training (CPT): Qwen3-1.7B and Qwen3-4B models adapted to Turkish legal domain through controlled curriculum learning. Four-phase CPT with optimal sample ratios enables gradual transition from general language knowledge to specialized legal terminology and long-context reasoning. This approach achieves 36.2% perplexity reduction on Turkish legal text, demonstrating domain adaptation gains.

TL;DR: The paper explores refusal behavior in LLMs, proposing it stems from a universal semantic circuit. A framework transfers refusal interventions across models without target-side supervision, maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address refusal behavior in aligned LLMs by hypothesizing a shared, low-dimensional semantic circuit across models.

Method: Introduces Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, aligning layers with concept fingerprints and using a shared 'recipe' of concept atoms. Includes a weight-SVD stability guard to prevent collateral damage.

Result: Transferred interventions consistently attenuate refusal behavior across 8 model pairs without compromising performance.

Conclusion: The findings support the semantic universality of safety alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Refusal behavior in aligned LLMs is often viewed as model-specific, yet we hypothesize it stems from a universal, low-dimensional semantic circuit shared across models. To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs (including GPT-OSS-20B and GLM-4) confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.

TL;DR: The paper explores a scalable multilingual Text2Cypher approach using LoRA adapters and fusion MLP to support new languages efficiently, avoiding full fine-tuning and manual tuning while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multilingual support for Text2Cypher systems beyond English while avoiding costly full fine-tuning and manual hyper-parameter tuning.

Method: Train language-specific LoRA adapters for English, Spanish, and Turkish, combined via uniform linear merging or learned fusion MLP with dynamic gating.

Result: Fusion MLP recovers ~75% of accuracy gains from joint multilingual fine-tuning, outperforming linear merging and requiring less data.

Conclusion: Learned adapter fusion provides a scalable, data-efficient alternative to joint fine-tuning for multilingual Text2Cypher tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models enable users to access database using natural language interfaces using tools like Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher, which translate user questions into structured database queries. While these systems improve database accessibility, most research focuses on English with limited multilingual support. This work investigates a scalable multilingual Text2Cypher, aiming to support new languages without re-running full fine-tuning, avoiding manual hyper-parameter tuning, and maintaining performance close to joint multilingual fine-tuning. We train language-specific LoRA adapters for English, Spanish, and Turkish and combined them via uniform linear merging or learned fusion MLP with dynamic gating. Experimental results show that the fusion MLP recovers around 75\% of the accuracy gains from joint multilingual fine-tuning while requiring only a smaller subset of the data, outperforming linear merging across all three languages. This approach enables incremental language expansion to new languages by requiring only one LoRA adapter and a lightweight MLP retraining. Learned adapter fusion offers a practical alternative to expensive joint fine-tuning, balancing performance, data efficiency, and scalability for multilingual Text2Cypher task.

TL;DR: SynthOCR-Gen is an open-source tool for generating synthetic OCR datasets for low-resource languages, addressing the lack of annotated data by transforming Unicode text corpora into training-ready datasets with augmentation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of OCR for low-resource languages like Kashmiri, which lack large annotated datasets and support in major OCR systems, motivates the need for a synthetic data generation tool.

Method: The tool uses a pipeline for text segmentation, Unicode normalization, multi-font rendering, and data augmentation to simulate real-world document degradations.

Result: A 600,000-sample Kashmiri OCR dataset was generated and released publicly, demonstrating the tool's efficacy.

Conclusion: SynthOCR-Gen provides a practical solution for integrating low-resource languages into vision-language AI models and is openly available for global use.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for low-resource languages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated training datasets. Languages such as Kashmiri, with approximately 7 million speakers and a complex Perso-Arabic script featuring unique diacritical marks, currently lack support in major OCR systems including Tesseract, TrOCR, and PaddleOCR. Manual dataset creation for such languages is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, often requiring word by word transcription of printed or handwritten text.
  We present SynthOCR-Gen, an open-source synthetic OCR dataset generator specifically designed for low-resource languages. Our tool addresses the fundamental bottleneck in OCR development by transforming digital Unicode text corpora into ready-to-use training datasets. The system implements a comprehensive pipeline encompassing text segmentation (character, word, n-gram, sentence, and line levels), Unicode normalization with script purity enforcement, multi-font rendering with configurable distribution, and 25+ data augmentation techniques simulating real-world document degradations including rotation, blur, noise, and scanner artifacts.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating a 600,000-sample word-segmented Kashmiri OCR dataset, which we release publicly on HuggingFace.

### [106] [Improving Training Efficiency and Reducing Maintenance Costs via Language Specific Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16127)
*Alphaeus Dmonte,Vidhi Gupta,Daniel J Perry,Mark Arehart*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Merging multilingual multitask models improves efficiency without sacrificing quality, reducing training time by up to 50% and maintenance costs by over 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency and maintenance bottleneck of retraining multilingual LLMs when updating or adding languages.

Method: Analyzed a merging strategy for multilingual multitask models across three tasks, comparing it to full retraining.

Result: Demonstrated significant efficiency gains (50% faster training, 60% lower maintenance costs) while maintaining quality parity.

Conclusion: The merging approach is highly efficient for both academic and industrial use cases, offering a scalable solution for multilingual model updates.

Abstract: Fine-tuning a task-specific multilingual large language model (LLM) involves training the model on a multilingual dataset with examples in all the required languages. Updating one or more supported languages with additional data or adding support for a new language involves retraining the model, which can be computationally inefficient and creates a severe maintenance bottleneck. Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model. We show this on both public and proprietary industry datasets confirming that the approach works well for industrial use cases in addition to academic settings already studied in previous work.

### [107] [Automatic Classification of Arabic Literature into Historical Eras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16138)
*Zainab Alhathloul,Irfan Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uses neural networks to classify Arabic texts by time period, achieving varying F1-scores across datasets and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to fill the gap in automatic classification of Arabic texts by historical era, especially beyond poetry.

Method: Neural networks and deep learning techniques are applied to classify texts from pre-Islamic to modern eras using two datasets.

Result: F1-scores range from 0.83 (binary) to 0.18 (12-class) across datasets, showing effectiveness decreases with more classes.

Conclusion: Deep learning can classify Arabic texts by era but struggles with finer-grained distinctions.

Abstract: The Arabic language has undergone notable transformations over time, including the emergence of new vocabulary, the obsolescence of others, and shifts in word usage. This evolution is evident in the distinction between the classical and modern Arabic eras. Although historians and linguists have partitioned Arabic literature into multiple eras, relatively little research has explored the automatic classification of Arabic texts by time period, particularly beyond the domain of poetry. This paper addresses this gap by employing neural networks and deep learning techniques to automatically classify Arabic texts into distinct eras and periods. The proposed models are evaluated using two datasets derived from two publicly available corpora, covering texts from the pre-Islamic to the modern era. The study examines class setups ranging from binary to 15-class classification and considers both predefined historical eras and custom periodizations. Results range from F1-scores of 0.83 and 0.79 on the binary-era classification task using the OpenITI and APCD datasets, respectively, to 0.20 on the 15-era classification task using OpenITI and 0.18 on the 12-era classification task using APCD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-in-Sandbox enables LLMs to use a code sandbox for non-code tasks, showing generalization capabilities without extra training and further enhanced via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs can leverage a code sandbox for tasks outside coding, demonstrating their ability to generalize and adapt to diverse domains like math and biomedicine.

Method: LLMs interact with a code sandbox for tasks like accessing external resources or executing scripts. Reinforcement learning (LLM-in-Sandbox-RL) trains models using non-agentic data.

Result: LLM-in-Sandbox achieves robust performance in math, physics, chemistry, biomedicine, long-context understanding, and instruction following.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective generalization and adaptability of LLMs in non-code domains, with potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We introduce LLM-in-Sandbox, enabling LLMs to explore within a code sandbox (i.e., a virtual computer), to elicit general intelligence in non-code domains. We first demonstrate that strong LLMs, without additional training, exhibit generalization capabilities to leverage the code sandbox for non-code tasks. For example, LLMs spontaneously access external resources to acquire new knowledge, leverage the file system to handle long contexts, and execute scripts to satisfy formatting requirements. We further show that these agentic capabilities can be enhanced through LLM-in-Sandbox Reinforcement Learning (LLM-in-Sandbox-RL), which uses only non-agentic data to train models for sandbox exploration. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-in-Sandbox, in both training-free and post-trained settings, achieves robust generalization spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biomedicine, long-context understanding, and instruction following. Finally, we analyze LLM-in-Sandbox's efficiency from computational and system perspectives, and open-source it as a Python package to facilitate real-world deployment.

*Chandan Kumar Sahu,Premith Kumar Chilukuri,Matthew Hetrich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MiRAGE is a multiagent framework for evaluating RAG systems, generating domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop QA datasets to address the lack of specialized benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents, which require multimodal and multi-hop reasoning. MiRAGE aims to fill this gap.

Method: MiRAGE uses a swarm of specialized agents: a context optimization loop, an adversarial verifier, and an expert persona recognizer to create verified, complex datasets.

Result: MiRAGE produces datasets with higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness across four domains. It can leverage LLMs if image descriptions are available.

Conclusion: MiRAGE automates the creation of gold standard datasets, providing infrastructure to benchmark next-gen information retrieval systems, though visual grounding remains a challenge.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) toward multimodal, high-stakes enterprise applications has outpaced the development of domain specific evaluation benchmarks. Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.

*Alfred Shen,Aaron Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Gated Sparse Attention (GSA) combines sparse attention and gated attention to improve efficiency, quality, and stability in long-context language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational burden and instability in long-context language models by merging the strengths of sparse and gated attention mechanisms.

Method: Introduces GSA with gated lightning indexer, adaptive sparsity controller, and dual gating at value and output stages.

Result: Achieves 12-16x speedup, reduces perplexity (6.03 to 5.70), improves RULER scores, and decreases attention sinks (47% to 4%).

Conclusion: GSA successfully merges sparse and gated attention benefits, offering efficiency, quality, and stability improvements.

Abstract: The computational burden of attention in long-context language models has motivated two largely independent lines of work: sparse attention mechanisms that reduce complexity by attending to selected tokens, and gated attention variants that improve training sta-bility while mitigating the attention sink phenomenon. We observe that these approaches address complementary weaknesses and propose Gated Sparse Attention (GSA), an architecture that realizes the benefits of both. GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%. Training stability improves markedly, with loss spikes reduced by 98%.

TL;DR: ALIGNAgent is a multi-agent framework integrating knowledge estimation, skill-gap identification, and resource recommendation to personalize learning, achieving high precision and F1 scores in empirical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized learning systems are fragmented; ALIGNAgent aims to integrate knowledge tracing, diagnostic modeling, and resource recommendation into a cohesive adaptive cycle.

Method: ALIGNAgent uses quiz performance, gradebook data, and learner preferences to estimate proficiency, identify skill gaps, and recommend tailored materials via continuous feedback loops.

Result: Empirical evaluations show ALIGNAgent achieves precision of 0.87-0.90 and F1 scores of 0.84-0.87 in knowledge proficiency estimation.

Conclusion: ALIGNAgent effectively personalizes learning through its integrated framework, demonstrating strong performance in real-world educational settings.

Abstract: Personalized learning systems have emerged as a promising approach to enhance student outcomes by tailoring educational content, pacing, and feedback to individual needs. However, most existing systems remain fragmented, specializing in either knowledge tracing, diagnostic modeling, or resource recommendation, but rarely integrating these components into a cohesive adaptive cycle. In this paper, we propose ALIGNAgent (Adaptive Learner Intelligence for Gap Identification and Next-step guidance), a multi-agent educational framework designed to deliver personalized learning through integrated knowledge estimation, skill-gap identification, and targeted resource recommendation.ALIGNAgent begins by processing student quiz performance, gradebook data, and learner preferences to generate topic-level proficiency estimates using a Skill Gap Agent that employs concept-level diagnostic reasoning to identify specific misconceptions and knowledge deficiencies. After identifying skill gaps, the Recommender Agent retrieves preference-aware learning materials aligned with diagnosed deficiencies, implementing a continuous feedback loop where interventions occur before advancing to subsequent topics. Extensive empirical evaluation on authentic datasets from two undergraduate computer science courses demonstrates ALIGNAgent's effectiveness, with GPT-4o-based agents achieving precision of 0.87-0.90 and F1 scores of 0.84-0.87 in knowledge proficiency estimation validated against actual exam performance.

*Ethan Zhang*

TL;DR: The study investigates biases in LLM-based medical AI systems for emergency department triage, revealing discriminatory behavior linked to proxy variables and input context tokens, highlighting the need for safer AI deployment in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover hidden biases in large language models (LLMs) used in clinical decision-making, particularly in emergency department triage, due to their potential impact on patient care across diverse backgrounds.

Method: Employed 32 patient-level proxy variables with paired qualifiers and evaluated effects using public (MIMIC-IV-ED Demo, MIMIC-IV Demo) and restricted-access datasets (MIMIC-IV-ED, MIMIC-IV).

Result: Found discriminatory behavior mediated by proxy variables and systematic severity modifications based on input context tokens, indicating reliance on noisy, non-causal signals.

Conclusion: AI systems in clinical settings are imperfectly trained; further efforts are needed to ensure safe and responsible deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their integration into clinical decision-making; however, hidden biases against patients across racial, social, economic, and clinical backgrounds persist. In this study, we investigate bias in LLM-based medical AI systems applied to emergency department (ED) triage. We employ 32 patient-level proxy variables, each represented by paired positive and negative qualifiers, and evaluate their effects using both public (MIMIC-IV-ED Demo, MIMIC-IV Demo) and restricted-access credentialed (MIMIC-IV-ED and MIMIC-IV) datasets as appropriate~\cite{mimiciv_ed_demo,mimiciv_ed,mimiciv}. Our results reveal discriminatory behavior mediated through proxy variables in ED triage scenarios, as well as a systematic tendency for LLMs to modify perceived patient severity when specific tokens appear in the input context, regardless of whether they are framed positively or negatively. These findings indicate that AI systems is still imperfectly trained on noisy, sometimes non-causal signals that do not reliably reflect true patient acuity. Consequently, more needs to be done to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AI technologies in clinical settings.

TL;DR: TLDR: Existing benchmarks for evaluating automated scientific surveys rely on flawed criteria. DeepSurvey-Bench is introduced to assess academic value comprehensively across three dimensions, showing high alignment with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unreliability of current benchmarks for evaluating automated surveys due to their reliance on surface-level metrics and flawed ground truth datasets.

Method: The method involves proposing DeepSurvey-Bench, which evaluates surveys based on three academic dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value, using annotated datasets.

Result: Experiments show DeepSurvey-Bench aligns well with human assessments of academic value in generated surveys.

Conclusion: DeepSurvey-Bench effectively addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks by focusing on deep academic value, proving reliable in evaluations.

Abstract: The rapid development of automated scientific survey generation technology has made it increasingly important to establish a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the quality of generated surveys.Nearly all existing evaluation benchmarks rely on flawed selection criteria such as citation counts and structural coherence to select human-written surveys as the ground truth survey datasets, and then use surface-level metrics such as structural quality and reference relevance to evaluate generated surveys.However, these benchmarks have two key issues: (1) the ground truth survey datasets are unreliable because of a lack academic dimension annotations; (2) the evaluation metrics only focus on the surface quality of the survey such as logical coherence. Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep "academic value", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys. Specifically, our benchmark propose a comprehensive academic value evaluation criteria covering three dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value. Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our benchmark is highly consistent with human performance in assessing the academic value of generated surveys.

*Mustafa Arslan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Aeon, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Operating System, addresses LLM limitations by structuring memory into a Memory Palace and Trace, achieving sub-millisecond retrieval latency with its Semantic Lookaside Buffer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming LLMs' constraints like quadratic computational costs and degraded reasoning with expanded contexts, Aeon tackles 'Vector Haze' by managing memory hierarchically and temporally.

Method: Aeon combines a Memory Palace (spatial index via SIMD-accelerated Atlas) and Trace (neuro-symbolic episodic graph), enhanced by the Semantic Lookaside Buffer for predictive caching.

Result: Benchmarks show Aeon achieves <1ms retrieval latency and state consistency via a zero-copy C++/Python bridge, enabling persistent memory for autonomous agents.

Conclusion: Aeon redefines memory management for LLMs, ensuring efficient, structured memory retrieval and continuity in long-horizon interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally constrained by the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon, where reasoning capabilities degrade as context windows expand. Existing solutions, primarily "Flat RAG" architectures relying on vector databases, treat memory as an unstructured bag of embeddings. This approach fails to capture the hierarchical and temporal structure of long-horizon interactions, leading to "Vector Haze", the retrieval of disjointed facts lacking episodic continuity. We propose Aeon, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Operating System that redefines memory not as a static store, but as a managed OS resource. Aeon structures memory into a Memory Palace (a spatial index implemented via Atlas, a SIMD-accelerated Page-Clustered Vector Index that combines small-world graph navigation with B+ Tree-style disk locality to minimize read amplification) and a Trace (a neuro-symbolic episodic graph). We introduce the Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB), a predictive caching mechanism that exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-millisecond retrieval latencies. Benchmarks demonstrate that Aeon achieves < 1ms retrieval latency on conversational workloads while ensuring state consistency via a zero-copy C++/Python bridge, effectively enabling persistent, structured memory for autonomous agents.

TL;DR: This paper surveys the transition from traditional multimodal fake news detection methods to unified, end-to-end frameworks using large vision-language models (LVLMs), highlighting advancements, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of a systematic survey tracing the evolution of multimodal fake news detection (MFND) driven by LVLMs, consolidating recent advancements and identifying gaps.

Method: The authors provide a historical perspective, categorize model architectures and datasets, analyze technical challenges (e.g., interpretability, temporal reasoning), and outline future research directions.

Result: The review systematically documents LVLMs' transformative role in MFND, offering insights into current limitations and potential improvements.

Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive survey on LVLMs in MFND, serving as a foundational resource for future research in combating multimodal misinformation.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has driven a paradigm shift in multimodal fake news detection (MFND), transforming it from traditional feature-engineering approaches to unified, end-to-end multimodal reasoning frameworks. Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DFAH, a framework to ensure determinism and faithfulness in LLM agents for financial services, revealing correlations between model consistency and evidence alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents often fail to produce consistent results in regulatory audits, necessitating a reliable framework for determinism and faithfulness evaluation.

Method: DFAH measures trajectory determinism and evidence-conditioned faithfulness across various model configurations (sizes, providers) and benchmarks.

Result: Smaller models (7-20B) achieved 100% determinism, while larger models (120B+) required bigger validation samples. Tier 1 schema-first models met audit replay requirements.

Conclusion: DFAH successfully evaluates LLM agents for audit reliability, finding determinism correlates with faithfulness, and identifies Tier 1 models as suitable for financial benchmarks.

Abstract: LLM agents struggle with regulatory audit replay: when asked to reproduce a flagged transaction decision with identical inputs, most deployments fail to return consistent results. This paper introduces the Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance Harness (DFAH), a framework for measuring trajectory determinism and evidence-conditioned faithfulness in tool-using agents deployed in financial services.
  Across 74 configurations (12 models, 4 providers, 8-24 runs each at T=0.0) in non-agentic baseline experiments, 7-20B parameter models achieved 100% determinism, while 120B+ models required 3.7x larger validation samples to achieve equivalent statistical reliability. Agentic tool-use introduces additional variance (see Tables 4-7). Contrary to the assumed reliability-capability trade-off, a positive Pearson correlation emerged (r = 0.45, p < 0.01, n = 51 at T=0.0) between determinism and faithfulness; models producing consistent outputs also tended to be more evidence-aligned.
  Three financial benchmarks are provided (compliance triage, portfolio constraints, DataOps exceptions; 50 cases each) along with an open-source stress-test harness. In these benchmarks and under DFAH evaluation settings, Tier 1 models with schema-first architectures achieved determinism levels consistent with audit replay requirements.

*Mark Wind*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prometheus Mind retrofits memory to frozen Qwen3-4B using modular adapters, solving extraction, training, injection, and hidden state collapse issues. It achieves high retrieval accuracy on clean inputs but struggles with informal ones, mainly due to relation classification errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable memory addition to pretrained language models without architectural changes or weight modification, focusing on practicality and reversibility.

Method: Uses 11 modular adapters (530MB, 7% overhead) and solves four key problems: extraction (via CDD), training (stage-wise), injection (leveraging lm_head.weight), and hidden state collapse (projections).

Result: Achieves 94.4% retrieval accuracy on clean inputs but drops to 19.4% on informal inputs. Relation classification is the main bottleneck (47.3% accuracy).

Conclusion: Prometheus Mind successfully adds memory to frozen models with minimal overhead, though performance on informal inputs and relation classification needs improvement.

Abstract: Adding memory to pretrained language models typically requires architectural changes or weight modification. We present Prometheus Mind, which retrofits memory to a frozen Qwen3-4B using 11 modular adapters (530MB, 7% overhead) -- fully reversible by removing the adapters. Building this system required solving four problems: (1) Extraction -- we develop Contrastive Direction Discovery (CDD), which finds semantic directions via minimal pairs without labeled data. (2) Training -- end-to-end optimization collapses; stage-wise training of each adapter on simple proxy tasks succeeds. (3) Injection -- learned encoders fail to generalize; we find that lm_head.weight rows already provide the mapping we need, requiring no training. (4) Hidden state collapse -- transformers make ``wife'' and ``brother'' 0.98+ similar; we train projections to recover distinction (0.98 $\rightarrow$ 0.09). On PrometheusExtract-132 (132 cases), the system achieves 94.4% retrieval on clean inputs (n=54, 95% CI: [84.9%, 98.1%]), degrading to 19.4% on informal inputs with ellipsis, filler words, or implicit subjects (n=36). The primary bottleneck is relation classification (47.3% accuracy), responsible for most extraction errors.

Result: The research offers practical examples and results for KG networks in healthcare, demonstrating their potential under diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting the innovation in KG network theory and its practical applications in medicine and healthcare.

Abstract: The rash development of knowledge graph research has brought big driving force to its application in many areas, including the medicine and healthcare domain. However, we have found that the application of some major information processing techniques on knowledge graph still lags behind. This defect includes the failure to make sufficient use of advanced logic reasoning, advanced artificial intelligence techniques, special-purpose programming languages, modern probabilistic and statistic theories et al. on knowledge graphs development and application. In particular, the multiple knowledge graphs cooperation and competition techniques have not got enough attention from researchers. This paper develops a systematic theory, technique and application of the concept 'knowledge graph network' and its application in medical and healthcare domain. Our research covers its definition, development, reasoning, computing and application under different conditions such as unsharp, uncertain, multi-modal, vectorized, distributed, federated. Almost in each case we provide (real data) examples and experiment results. Finally, a conclusion of innovation is provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges in gene expression data integration due to privacy and cost constraints by leveraging routinely collected clinical data.

Method: Uses Transformer Encoder for histopathology slides and Cross Attention with clinical metadata to guide gene expression synthesis via GAN.

Result: GeMM-GAN generates more realistic and biologically meaningful gene expression profiles, improving downstream disease prediction by 11%.

Conclusion: GeMM-GAN provides a promising solution for integrating gene expression data with clinical and imaging data, enhancing biomedical research capabilities.

Abstract: Biomedical research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, including gene expression profiles, medical images, and clinical metadata. While medical images and clinical metadata are routinely collected in clinical practice, gene expression data presents unique challenges for widespread research use, mainly due to stringent privacy regulations and costly laboratory experiments. To address these limitations, we present GeMM-GAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network conditioned on histopathology tissue slides and clinical metadata, designed to synthesize realistic gene expression profiles. GeMM-GAN combines a Transformer Encoder for image patches with a final Cross Attention mechanism between patches and text tokens, producing a conditioning vector to guide a generative model in generating biologically coherent gene expression profiles. We evaluate our approach on the TCGA dataset and demonstrate that our framework outperforms standard generative models and generates more realistic and functionally meaningful gene expression profiles, improving by more than 11\% the accuracy on downstream disease type prediction compared to current state-of-the-art generative models.

*Peidong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing) is introduced to address limitations of existing Speech LLMs in recognizing domain-specific terms, offering a scalable and efficient solution without the drawbacks of prompting or GEC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Speech LLMs struggle with domain-specific terms due to static training knowledge, while current solutions like prompting and GEC suffer from scalability issues and over-correction, respectively.

Method: LOGIC operates directly in the decoding layer, decoupling context injection from input processing to ensure constant-time complexity.

Result: Experiments show LOGIC achieves a 9% reduction in Entity WER with only a 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate across multilingual locales.

Conclusion: LOGIC provides an efficient and robust framework for improving Speech LLMs' recognition of domain-specific terms, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of new entities -- driven by cultural shifts, evolving trends, and personalized user data -- poses a significant challenge for existing Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from "over-correction", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.
  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length.

### [121] [Not Your Typical Sycophant: The Elusive Nature of Sycophancy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15436)
*Shahar Ben Natan,Oren Tsur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to evaluate sycophancy in LLMs using a zero-sum game framework, revealing that some models show moral remorse when sycophancy harms others, while recency bias exacerbates sycophantic tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncontrolled bias and manipulative language in prior works, the study aims to provide a neutral and direct evaluation of LLM sycophancy.

Method: The approach uses LLM-as-a-judge in a zero-sum game setting, comparing four models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGPT 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, Claude Sonnet 3.7) under scenarios where sycophancy benefits the user at another's cost.

Result: All models exhibited sycophantic tendencies, but Claude and Mistral showed moral remorse when sycophancy harmed a third party. Recency bias interacted with sycophancy, amplifying the effect when the user's opinion was presented last.

Conclusion: The study highlights the interplay between sycophancy and recency bias in LLMs and identifies moral remorse in some models, suggesting ethical considerations in their design.

Abstract: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.

*Alex Goessmann,Janina Schütte,Maximilian Fröhlich,Martin Eigel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a tensor network formalism unifying neural and symbolic AI by encoding functions and modeling decompositions, enabling hybrid logical-probabilistic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge neural and symbolic AI by leveraging tensor decompositions for unified representation and inference.

Method: Introduces tensor network formalism, basis encoding, and tensor decompositions to model logical formulas and probability distributions.

Result: Develops Hybrid Logic Network and tnreason library for practical implementation.

Conclusion: The framework unifies reasoning algorithms and enables scalable hybrid modeling.

Abstract: The unification of neural and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence remains a central open challenge. In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism, which captures sparsity principles originating in the different approaches in tensor decompositions. In particular, we describe a basis encoding scheme for functions and model neural decompositions as tensor decompositions. The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network. The theoretical concepts are accompanied by the python library tnreason, which enables the implementation and practical use of the proposed architectures.

### [123] [Reliability by design: quantifying and eliminating fabrication risk in LLMs. From generative to consultative AI: a comparative analysis in the legal domain and lessons for high-stakes knowledge bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15476)
*Alex Dantart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs for legal work, introducing metrics FCR and FFR. Standalone models are unreliable (FCR>30%), basic RAG improves but advanced RAG (embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, self-correction) reduces errors to <0.2%. Legal AI needs rigorous, retrieval-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability of large language models for high-stakes legal tasks by reducing hallucinations and ensuring traceability.

Method: The study evaluates 2,700 judicial-style answers from 12 LLMs across 75 legal tasks using expert review. It compares three paradigms: standalone generative models, basic RAG, and advanced RAG (embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, self-correction). Two metrics (FCR, FFR) measure reliability.

Result: Standalone models have FCR above 30%, basic RAG reduces errors but still misgrounds, and advanced RAG achieves negligible fabrication (<0.2%).

Conclusion: Trustworthy legal AI requires rigorous, retrieval-based architectures with verification and traceability. The evaluation framework can extend to other high-risk domains.

Abstract: This paper examines how to make large language models reliable for high-stakes legal work by reducing hallucinations. It distinguishes three AI paradigms: (1) standalone generative models ("creative oracle"), (2) basic retrieval-augmented systems ("expert archivist"), and (3) an advanced, end-to-end optimized RAG system ("rigorous archivist"). The authors introduce two reliability metrics -False Citation Rate (FCR) and Fabricated Fact Rate (FFR)- and evaluate 2,700 judicial-style answers from 12 LLMs across 75 legal tasks using expert, double-blind review. Results show that standalone models are unsuitable for professional use (FCR above 30%), while basic RAG greatly reduces errors but still leaves notable misgrounding. Advanced RAG, using techniques such as embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, and self-correction, reduces fabrication to negligible levels (below 0.2%). The study concludes that trustworthy legal AI requires rigor-focused, retrieval-based architectures emphasizing verification and traceability, and provides an evaluation framework applicable to other high-risk domains.

*Yiyang Feng,Zeming Chen,Haotian Wu,Jiawei Zhou,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACK is a new benchmark for evaluating how LLMs handle conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning, showing that updated facts can sometimes worsen performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of outdated or incorrect information in LLMs and the limitations of current methods (in-context updates, knowledge editing) that introduce knowledge conflicts, especially in multi-step reasoning.

Method: The authors introduce TRACK, a benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning across three scenarios (WIKI, CODE, MATH).

Result: Results indicate providing updated facts can degrade performance compared to no updates, with worsening effects as more facts are introduced. This stems from failed fact integration and flawed reasoning.

Conclusion: TRACK serves as a rigorous benchmark to measure and improve how LLMs handle conflicting knowledge in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: A common solution for mitigating outdated or incorrect information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is to provide updated facts in-context or through knowledge editing. However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.

*Prasanna Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transfer Learning & Transformers improve accuracy but may polarize sentiments and reduce neutrality, posing challenges for reliable NLP applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the unintended consequences of transformer-based accuracy improvements in sentiment analytics, particularly the loss of neutrality.

Method: Experimental observation of transformer-led sentiment analytics performance.

Result: Accuracy improvements in one sentiment class can polarize another and diminish neutrality.

Conclusion: The lack of neutrality in sentiment analytics is problematic for reliable industry applications.

Abstract: The use of Transfer Learning & Transformers has steadily improved accuracy and has significantly contributed in solving complex computation problems. However, this transformer led accuracy improvement in Applied AI Analytics specifically in sentiment analytics comes with the dark side. It is observed during experiments that a lot of these improvements in transformer led accuracy of one class of sentiment has been at the cost of polarization of another class of sentiment and the failing of neutrality. This lack of neutrality poses an acute problem in the Applied NLP space, which relies heavily on the computational outputs of sentiment analytics for reliable industry ready tasks.

*Zhichao Yang,Jiashu He,Jinxuan Fan,Cirillo Cinzia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes TransportAgents, a multi-agent framework combining LLM reasoning and MLP integration to improve traffic crash severity prediction, outperforming traditional and LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-agent LLMs struggle with heterogeneous crash data and biased predictions, necessitating a more robust solution for traffic safety.

Method: TransportAgents uses specialized agents for different crash data subsets (e.g., demographics, environment) and integrates their outputs with an MLP module.

Result: The framework outperforms baselines on U.S. datasets (CPSRMS, NEISS), showing robustness, scalability, and balanced predictions across LLM backbones.

Conclusion: TransportAgents offers reliable, interpretable predictions for safety-critical applications, addressing LLM limitations in crash severity analysis.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic crash severity is critical for improving emergency response and public safety planning. Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.

### [127] [From Generative Engines to Actionable Simulators: The Imperative of Physical Grounding in World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15533)
*Zhikang Chen,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current world models prioritize visual fidelity over causal understanding, leading to failures in critical decision-making. Effective models should focus on causal structure, domain constraints, and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of current world models, which conflate high-fidelity video generation with true understanding of physical and causal dynamics. It highlights their shortcomings in safety-critical scenarios.

Method: The survey critiques existing models and proposes reframing them as actionable simulators with structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation.

Result: Modern models excel in pixel prediction but fail in respecting invariant constraints and intervention scenarios. The proposed shift emphasizes robust foresight and counterfactual reasoning.

Conclusion: The value of world models lies in their ability to support long-horizon planning and intervention, not visual realism. This is validated using medical decision-making as a rigorous test case.

Abstract: A world model is an AI system that simulates how an environment evolves under actions, enabling planning through imagined futures rather than reactive perception. Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.

*Cecil Pang,Hiroki Sayama*

TL;DR: AUTOBUS integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and enterprise data into a neuro-symbolic AI system to automate and orchestrate business initiatives while ensuring accountability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current enterprise systems are rigid and siloed, while LLMs lack deterministic execution of business logic, creating a need for a more adaptable and verifiable solution.

Method: AUTOBUS combines LLMs, logic programming, and enterprise knowledge graphs to model initiatives as task networks with explicit conditions, data, and actions. AI agents synthesize task-specific logic programs executed by a logic engine.

Result: The system enables deterministic execution of complex business logic while maintaining human oversight for accountability and adaptability.

Conclusion: AUTOBUS bridges the gap between flexible LLMs and rigid enterprise systems, offering a scalable and accountable solution for business process automation.

Abstract: Current business environments require organizations to continuously reconfigure cross-functional processes, yet enterprise systems are still organized around siloed departments, rigid workflows, and hard-coded automation. Meanwhile large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting natural language and unstructured data but lack deterministic, verifiable execution of complex business logic. To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability. We detail the AUTOBUS architecture, the anatomy of the AI agent generated logic programs, and the role of humans and auxiliary tools in the lifecycle of a business initiative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses limitations of existing benchmarks for assessing LLMs' ToM, which are narrow and fail to capture full human cognitive mechanisms.

Method: Developed CogToM, a bilingual benchmark with 8000+ instances across 46 paradigms, validated by 49 human annotators. Evaluated 22 LLMs, including GPT-5.1 and Qwen3-Max.

Result: Identified significant performance heterogeneities among models and persistent bottlenecks. Found potential divergences between LLM and human cognitive structures.

Conclusion: CogToM provides a robust tool for exploring LLMs' cognitive boundaries and highlights ongoing challenges in achieving human-like ToM capabilities.

Abstract: Whether Large Language Models (LLMs) truly possess human-like Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities has garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks remain largely restricted to narrow paradigms like false belief tasks, failing to capture the full spectrum of human cognitive mechanisms. We introduce CogToM, a comprehensive, theoretically grounded benchmark comprising over 8000 bilingual instances across 46 paradigms, validated by 49 human annotator.A systematic evaluation of 22 representative models, including frontier models like GPT-5.1 and Qwen3-Max, reveals significant performance heterogeneities and highlights persistent bottlenecks in specific dimensions. Further analysis based on human cognitive patterns suggests potential divergences between LLM and human cognitive structures. CogToM offers a robust instrument and perspective for investigating the evolving cognitive boundaries of LLMs.

*Chandra Prakash,Mary Lind,Avneesh Sisodia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Unified Agent Lifecycle Management (UALM) blueprint to address challenges like agent sprawl in healthcare AI systems, offering structured governance across five control-plane layers and a maturity model for adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare organizations struggle with AI agent sprawl, leading to inefficiencies and risks like duplicated agents and unclear accountability, necessitating a robust governance framework.

Method: UALM is derived from synthesizing governance standards, agent security literature, and healthcare compliance, mapping gaps to five control-plane layers and a staged maturity model.

Result: UALM provides healthcare leaders with a structured approach to oversee AI agents, ensuring compliance, safety, and scalability while enabling innovation.

Conclusion: UALM addresses gaps in AI governance for healthcare, offering an actionable blueprint for managing agent fleets effectively and securely.

Abstract: Healthcare organizations are beginning to embed agentic AI into routine workflows, including clinical documentation support and early-warning monitoring. As these capabilities diffuse across departments and vendors, health systems face agent sprawl, causing duplicated agents, unclear accountability, inconsistent controls, and tool permissions that persist beyond the original use case. Existing AI governance frameworks emphasize lifecycle risk management but provide limited guidance for the day-to-day operations of agent fleets. We propose a Unified Agent Lifecycle Management (UALM) blueprint derived from a rapid, practice-oriented synthesis of governance standards, agent security literature, and healthcare compliance requirements. UALM maps recurring gaps onto five control-plane layers: (1) an identity and persona registry, (2) orchestration and cross-domain mediation, (3) PHI-bounded context and memory, (4) runtime policy enforcement with kill-switch triggers, and (5) lifecycle management and decommissioning linked to credential revocation and audit logging. A companion maturity model supports staged adoption. UALM offers healthcare CIOs, CISOs, and clinical leaders an implementable pattern for audit-ready oversight that preserves local innovation and enables safer scaling across clinical and administrative domains.

*Manish Bhatt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combines neuroscience-inspired signals with ML to detect LLM hallucinations efficiently, achieving competitive performance with minimal data and high interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder high-stakes deployment, and current detection methods are resource-intensive or opaque.

Method: Uses Predictive Coding and Information Bottleneck signals (e.g., Entity-Focused Uptake, Context Adherence, Falsifiability Score) with supervised learning.

Result: Achieves 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain) with 75x less data and 1000x faster inference than benchmarks.

Conclusion: Domain-inspired signal design outperforms scaling LLM judges, enabling lightweight, interpretable models for production.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- generations that are plausible but factually unfaithful -- remain a critical barrier to high-stakes deployment. Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).
  Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises ("Sycophancy").
  This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.

TL;DR: International collaboration refines AI agent testing methods to address risks like information leakage and cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of autonomous AI systems introduces new risks due to reduced oversight, necessitating robust testing across languages and cultures.

Method: Participants from multiple countries conducted a two-strand exercise: (1) common risks (e.g., sensitive information leakage) and (2) cybersecurity. Open and closed-weight models were evaluated using public benchmarks.

Result: The focus was on identifying methodological challenges in agentic testing rather than model performance, advancing the science of evaluations.

Conclusion: This collaboration represents progress in developing best practices for testing advanced AI systems globally.

Abstract: The rapid rise of autonomous AI systems and advancements in agent capabilities are introducing new risks due to reduced oversight of real-world interactions. Yet agent testing remains nascent and is still a developing science. As AI agents begin to be deployed globally, it is important that they handle different languages and cultures accurately and securely.
  To address this, participants from The International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the European Commission, France, Kenya, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have come together to align approaches to agentic evaluations.
  This is the third exercise, building on insights from two earlier joint testing exercises conducted by the Network in November 2024 and February 2025. The objective is to further refine best practices for testing advanced AI systems.
  The exercise was split into two strands: (1) common risks, including leakage of sensitive information and fraud, led by Singapore AISI; and (2) cybersecurity, led by UK AISI. A mix of open and closed-weight models were evaluated against tasks from various public agentic benchmarks. Given the nascency of agentic testing, our primary focus was on understanding methodological issues in conducting such tests, rather than examining test results or model capabilities. This collaboration marks an important step forward as participants work together to advance the science of agentic evaluations.

TL;DR: This survey explores how uncertainty in LLMs evolves from a passive metric to an active control signal, enhancing reliability in advanced reasoning, autonomous agents, and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unreliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains necessitates leveraging uncertainty as an active control signal to improve model behavior and trustworthiness.

Method: The survey examines three frontiers: advanced reasoning (optimizing computation and self-correction), autonomous agents (metacognitive decisions), and reinforcement learning (reward hacking mitigation). Theoretical frameworks like Bayesian methods and Conformal Prediction are used.

Result: Uncertainty is effectively used as an active signal across the three frontiers, enabling scalable and reliable AI.

Conclusion: Mastering uncertainty is crucial for developing the next generation of trustworthy AI, offering practical design patterns and a unified perspective.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their unreliability remains a critical barrier to deployment in high-stakes domains. This survey charts a functional evolution in addressing this challenge: the evolution of uncertainty from a passive diagnostic metric to an active control signal guiding real-time model behavior. We demonstrate how uncertainty is leveraged as an active control signal across three frontiers: in \textbf{advanced reasoning} to optimize computation and trigger self-correction; in \textbf{autonomous agents} to govern metacognitive decisions about tool use and information seeking; and in \textbf{reinforcement learning} to mitigate reward hacking and enable self-improvement via intrinsic rewards. By grounding these advancements in emerging theoretical frameworks like Bayesian methods and Conformal Prediction, we provide a unified perspective on this transformative trend. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, critical analysis, and practical design patterns, arguing that mastering the new trend of uncertainty is essential for building the next generation of scalable, reliable, and trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework to address the Spiral of Hallucination in AI agents by combining active uncertainty quantification with targeted self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents struggle with early errors propagating irreversibly (Spiral of Hallucination). Existing methods either passively diagnose risks (UQ) or correct aimlessly (self-reflection).

Method: The AUQ framework integrates two mechanisms: System 1 (UAM) implicitly propagates uncertainty explanations, while System 2 (UAR) uses these cues for targeted corrections.

Result: Experiments show the training-free AUQ framework outperforms benchmarks, achieving superior performance and calibration in closed-loop and open-ended tasks.

Conclusion: AUQ represents a principled step toward reliable AI agents by dynamically balancing efficiency and deliberation.

Abstract: Although AI agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in long-horizon reasoning, their reliability is severely hampered by the ``Spiral of Hallucination,'' where early epistemic errors propagate irreversibly. Existing methods face a dilemma: uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods typically act as passive sensors, only diagnosing risks without addressing them, while self-reflection mechanisms suffer from continuous or aimless corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration. We believe this principled framework AUQ represents a significant step towards reliable agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure AI model behavior remains safe and reliable across different linguistic and cultural settings globally.

Method: A joint multilingual evaluation exercise tested two open-weight models across ten languages using over 6,000 prompts across five harm categories, employing both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.

Result: Findings show variations in safety behaviors across languages and harm types, differences in evaluator reliability, and methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations.

Conclusion: The study is a foundational step toward a shared framework for multilingual safety testing of AI systems, advocating for continued collaboration with researchers and industry.

Abstract: As frontier AI models are deployed globally, it is essential that their behaviour remains safe and reliable across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. To examine how current model safeguards hold up in such settings, participants from the International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the EU, France, Kenya, South Korea and the UK conducted a joint multilingual evaluation exercise. Led by Singapore AISI, two open-weight models were tested across ten languages spanning high and low resourced groups: Cantonese English, Farsi, French, Japanese, Korean, Kiswahili, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Telugu. Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.
  The exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages. These include differences in safeguard robustness across languages and harm types and variation in evaluator reliability (LLM-as-judge vs. human review). Further, it also generated methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations, such as the need for culturally contextualised translations, stress-tested evaluator prompts and clearer human annotation guidelines. This work represents an initial step toward a shared framework for multilingual safety testing of advanced AI systems and calls for continued collaboration with the wider research community and industry.

### [136] [Benchmarking Text-to-Python against Text-to-SQL: The Impact of Explicit Logic and Ambiguity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15728)
*Hangle Hu,Chenyu Hou,Bin Cao,Ruizhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BIRD-Python, a benchmark for evaluating Text-to-Python systems in data retrieval, highlighting its sensitivity to user intent and proposing a Logic Completion Framework to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for Python in data analytics and the underexplored reliability of Text-to-Python compared to the mature Text-to-SQL ecosystem.

Method: Systematic refinement of the dataset to reduce noise and align execution semantics, and the introduction of the Logic Completion Framework (LCF) to address ambiguity in Python code generation.

Result: (1) Performance differences in Text-to-Python stem from missing domain context, not inherent code generation limitations. (2) When gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves parity with Text-to-SQL.

Conclusion: Python is viable for analytical agents if systems can effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL remains the dominant approach for database interaction, real-world analytics increasingly require the flexibility of general-purpose programming languages such as Python or Pandas to manage file-based data and complex analytical workflows. Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

*Hanning Zhang,Ruida Wang,Rui Pan,Wenyuan Wang,Bingxu Meng,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhysProver, enhancing formal theorem proving in physics using a dataset (PhysLeanData) and RLVR training, achieving significant improvements and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap in formal physics reasoning by leveraging theorem-proving frameworks akin to those in mathematics.

Method: Uses DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B and applies RLVR training with a dedicated dataset (PhysLeanData).

Result: Achieves a 2.4% improvement in physics domains and 1.3% gains on MiniF2F-Test, showing generalization.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and efficient, offering a model for extending formal provers beyond math.

Abstract: The combination of verifiable languages and LLMs has significantly influenced both the mathematical and computer science communities because it provides a rigorous foundation for theorem proving. Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains. To foster further research, we will release both our dataset and model to the community.

*Xinda Chen,Xing Zhen,Hanyu Zhang,Weimin Tan,Bo Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII) to handle dynamically changed tables by allowing trained models to incorporate new columns during inference, framed as an optimization problem using information bottleneck theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI models struggle with tables that dynamically change columns, necessitating unsupervised methods to adaptively incorporate new data.

Method: TabII uses Large Language Model placeholders, Pretrained TabAdapter, and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to optimize mutual information minimization and maximization per information bottleneck theory.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: TabII addresses the challenge of dynamically changed tables, enhancing AI model practicality through unsupervised incremental adaptation.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental form of data structure. The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Xiefeng Wu,Mingyu Hu,Shu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SigEnt-SAC is a new off-policy actor-critic method for real-world RL that learns efficiently with minimal data, using a sigmoid-bounded entropy term to stabilize training and outperform prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of real-world reinforcement learning, such as sample inefficiency and noisy observations, by proposing a low-cost method that avoids the pitfalls of large datasets and instability.

Method: SigEnt-SAC introduces a sigmoid-bounded entropy term to prevent negative-entropy-driven optimization and Q-function oscillations, learning from a single expert trajectory.

Result: Benchmarking on D4RL tasks shows SigEnt-SAC reduces Q-function oscillations and achieves a 100% success rate faster than baselines. Real-world robot tasks confirm its efficiency with minimal interactions.

Conclusion: SigEnt-SAC provides a practical and low-cost solution for real-world RL, enabling successful policy learning with minimal data and interactions.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning in the real world remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, sparse rewards, and noisy visual observations. Prior work leverages demonstrations and human feedback to improve learning efficiency and robustness. However, offline-to-online methods need large datasets and can be unstable, while VLA-assisted RL relies on large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning. As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.

*Jiaxin Zhang,Caiming Xiong,Chien-Sheng Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentic Confidence Calibration and Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC) to address AI agents' overconfidence in failure, outperforming baselines and offering interpretability, transferability, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents' overconfidence in failure hinders deployment in high-stakes settings, requiring new calibration methods beyond static approaches.

Method: Proposes HTC, a diagnostic framework extracting process-level features across an agent's trajectory using an interpretable model.

Result: HTC outperforms baselines in calibration/discrimination across benchmarks, LLMs, and frameworks, and introduces a General Agent Calibrator (GAC).

Conclusion: HTC establishes a process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, enhancing AI agent reliability.

Abstract: AI agents are rapidly advancing from passive language models to autonomous systems executing complex, multi-step tasks. Yet their overconfidence in failure remains a fundamental barrier to deployment in high-stakes settings. Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.

*James S. Pearson,Matthew J. Dennis,Marc Cheong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues against the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC) as a general requirement for creativity, citing generative AI's creative potential despite lacking intentional agency, and proposes a consistency requirement instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to challenge the traditional view that intentional agency is necessary for creativity, especially in light of advancements in generative AI.

Method: They use corpus evidence to show shifting linguistic intuitions about AI's creativity and apply conceptual engineering to critique the IAC's social function.

Result: The findings suggest the IAC is descriptively and functionally problematic for AI creativity, advocating for its replacement with a consistency requirement.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the IAC should be abandoned generally but retained in specific contexts, promoting a more inclusive understanding of creativity.

Abstract: Many theorists of creativity maintain that intentional agency is a necessary condition of creativity. We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products. Nonetheless, we explain why the IAC should be retained in specific local domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepVerifier is a rubrics-based verifier that enhances DRA performance through iterative self-improvement at inference time, outperforming baselines by 12%-48% and achieving 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRA efforts focus on post-training enhancements, but self-evolution during inference remains underexplored. This work aims to improve agent capabilities through verification-based iterative refinement.

Method: The approach uses a rubrics-based verifier (DeepVerifier) derived from a DRA Failure Taxonomy, integrating it as a plug-and-play module for iterative feedback during inference without additional training.

Result: DeepVerifier outperforms baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score and delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch subsets. A dataset (DeepVerifier-4K) is also released for open-source advancement.

Conclusion: DeepVerifier enables practical self-evolution of DRAs through verification-driven iterative refinement, significantly improving performance and supporting open-source development with a high-quality dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are transforming automated knowledge discovery and problem-solving. While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification. These examples emphasize reflection and self-critique, enabling open models to develop robust verification capabilities.

### [144] [ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas: Charting the Failure Landscape of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15812)
*Shir Ashury-Tahan,Yifan Mai,Elron Bandel,Michal Shmueli-Scheuer,Leshem Choshen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ErrorMap analyzes why Large Language Models fail by identifying unique failure signatures, helping developers debug models and improve benchmarks. ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of errors, reveals recurring patterns and underexplored issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks indicate failures but don't explain their causes, limiting reliable model improvement. ErrorMap aims to address this gap by pinpointing specific failure reasons.

Method: ErrorMap extracts failure signatures from models and benchmarks, creating ErrorAtlas—a taxonomy of errors derived from analyzing 35 datasets and 83 models.

Result: ErrorAtlas identifies recurring failure patterns (e.g., output omissions, question misinterpretation) underexplored in LLM research, providing deeper insights into model weaknesses.

Conclusion: ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas shift focus from success metrics to failure causes, enabling advanced evaluation and guiding progress in LLM development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) benchmarks tell us when models fail, but not why they fail. A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique "failure signature", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.

TL;DR: EvoCUA introduces an evolutionary cycle integrating data generation and policy optimization to overcome static data constraints in computer-use agents, achieving a 56.7% success rate on OSWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static datasets limit the potential of computer-use agents by failing to capture intricate causal dynamics in long-horizon tasks.

Method: EvoCUA combines verifiable task synthesis, scalable sandbox rollouts, and an iterative evolving learning strategy to dynamically regulate policy updates.

Result: EvoCUA achieves a 56.7% success rate, outperforming OpenCUA-72B (45.0%) and UI-TARS-2 (53.1%).

Conclusion: The evolving paradigm enables consistent performance gains across foundation models, offering a scalable path for advancing agent capabilities.

Abstract: The development of native computer-use agents (CUA) represents a significant leap in multimodal AI. However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%). Crucially, our results underscore the generalizability of this approach: the evolving paradigm driven by learning from experience yields consistent performance gains across foundation models of varying scales, establishing a robust and scalable path for advancing native agent capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICON introduces causal and topological priors to improve Text-Based Person Search robustness by addressing spurious correlations and semantic misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TBPS paradigms lack robustness in complex scenarios due to passive observation and spurious correlations.

Method: ICON uses Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement, Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization, and Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment.

Result: ICON leads benchmarks and shows robustness against occlusion, background interference, and noise.

Conclusion: ICON shifts TBPS from statistical co-occurrence fitting to learning causal invariance, advancing the field.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) holds unique value in real-world surveillance bridging visual perception and language understanding, yet current paradigms utilizing pre-training models often fail to transfer effectively to complex open-world scenarios. The reliance on "Passive Observation" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.

Motivation: The mismatch between high-level semantic concepts and pixel-level organization in planetary image archives limits scalable, open-ended exploration. MarScope addresses this by aligning images and text in a shared semantic space.

Method: MarScope trains on over 200,000 curated image-text pairs to align planetary images and natural language in a shared semantic space, enabling label-free mapping.

Result: The framework achieves F1 scores up to 0.978 for semantic retrieval queries across Mars in 5 seconds, facilitating flexible geomorphic mapping and process-oriented analysis.

Conclusion: MarScope introduces a new paradigm where natural language directly interfaces with massive geospatial datasets, revolutionizing planetary surface exploration.

Abstract: Planetary surfaces are typically analyzed using high-level semantic concepts in natural language, yet vast orbital image archives remain organized at the pixel level. This mismatch limits scalable, open-ended exploration of planetary surfaces. Here we present MarScope, a planetary-scale vision-language framework enabling natural language-driven, label-free mapping of Martian landforms. MarScope aligns planetary images and text in a shared semantic space, trained on over 200,000 curated image-text pairs. This framework transforms global geomorphic mapping on Mars by replacing pre-defined classifications with flexible semantic retrieval, enabling arbitrary user queries across the entire planet in 5 seconds with F1 scores up to 0.978. Applications further show that it extends beyond morphological classification to facilitate process-oriented analysis and similarity-based geomorphological mapping at a planetary scale. MarScope establishes a new paradigm where natural language serves as a direct interface for scientific discovery over massive geospatial datasets.

TL;DR: DT's redundancy in feeding the entire RTG sequence is addressed by DDT, which uses only the latest RTG, improving performance and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate redundancy in DT's design, as only the latest RTG affects action prediction, thereby enhancing efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes DDT, which processes only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG for action guidance.

Result: DDT outperforms DT and competes with state-of-the-art DT variants in offline RL tasks.

Conclusion: Streamlining RTG usage in DDT improves performance and computational efficiency, making it a superior alternative to DT.

Abstract: The Decision Transformer (DT) has established a powerful sequence modeling approach to offline reinforcement learning. It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT). DDT simplifies the architecture by processing only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG to guide the action prediction. This streamlined approach not only improves performance but also reduces computational cost. Our experiments show that DDT significantly outperforms DT and establishes competitive performance against state-of-the-art DT variants across multiple offline RL tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of live streaming introduces risks like scams and coordinated malicious behaviors, which are hard to detect due to their gradual accumulation and recurrence across streams.

Method: CS-VAR uses a lightweight, domain-specific model for fast session-level risk inference, trained with insights from a Large Language Model that analyzes cross-session behavioral evidence.

Result: Offline experiments and online validation on industrial datasets show CS-VAR achieves state-of-the-art performance and provides interpretable signals for effective moderation.

Conclusion: CS-VAR effectively detects recurring risks in live streaming, ensuring real-time efficiency and interpretability for practical deployment.

Abstract: The rise of live streaming has transformed online interaction, enabling massive real-time engagement but also exposing platforms to complex risks such as scams and coordinated malicious behaviors. Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.

Result: One-shot prompting with aligned exemplars performs best. Self-correction loops improve executability in zero-shot settings but offer limited gains with good exemplars.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reproducible setup for KG-grounded LLMs in synthesis planning, with best results from aligned exemplars.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid synthesis planning in chemistry, but standard prompting methods often yield hallucinated or outdated suggestions. We study LLM interactions with a reaction knowledge graph by casting reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher (natural language to graph query) generation problem, and define single- and multi-step retrieval tasks. We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present. We provide a reproducible Text2Cypher evaluation setup to facilitate further work on KG-grounded LLMs for synthesis planning.

TL;DR: AgriPINN integrates biophysical crop-growth constraints into deep learning for scalable and interpretable crop biomass prediction under water stress, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of crop biomass under water stress is essential for irrigation guidance and climate-resilient agriculture, but current models lack interpretability or scalability.

Method: AgriPINN combines a biophysical crop-growth differential equation with deep learning, pretrained on historical data and fine-tuned on controlled experiments.

Result: AgriPINN reduces RMSE by up to 43% compared to deep-learning and process-based models, while recovering latent physiological variables.

Conclusion: AgriPINN offers a robust, interpretable framework for crop biomass prediction, useful for irrigation planning and climate adaptation.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of crop above-ground biomass (AGB) under water stress is critical for monitoring crop productivity, guiding irrigation, and supporting climate-resilient agriculture. Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\%$) and computational efficiency. By combining the scalability of deep learning with the biophysical rigor of process-based modeling, AgriPINN provides a robust and interpretable framework for spatio-temporal AGB prediction, offering practical value for planning of irrigation infrastructure, yield forecasting, and climate-adaptation planning.

*Ruizhi Liu,Liming Xu,Xulin Huang,Jingyan Sui,Shizhe Ding,Boyang Xia,Chungong Yu,Dongbo Bu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepBound is a deep learning-based node selection algorithm for MILP problems, improving efficiency by automating heuristic learning and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MILP solving relies on heuristic strategies with unstable performance, prompting the need for an automated, data-driven approach like DeepBound.

Method: DeepBound uses a multi-level feature fusion network and pairwise training to prioritize nodes containing optimal solutions, addressing node imbalance.

Result: Experiments show DeepBound outperforms heuristic rules and other learning-based methods, achieving faster solutions with strong generalization.

Conclusion: DeepBound can automate and improve heuristic rules, offering robust and flexible solutions for MILP problems.

Abstract: Designing faster algorithms for solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems is highly desired across numerous practical domains, as a vast array of complex real-world challenges can be effectively modeled as MILP formulations. Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.

### [153] [Controlling Long-Horizon Behavior in Language Model Agents with Explicit State Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16087)
*Sukesh Subaharan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents often lack temporal coherence in tone and persona. This study explores using affective dynamics (Valence-Arousal-Dominance) to improve agent behavior, comparing stateless, first-order, and second-order dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focuses on turn-local sentiment, leaving affective dynamics in long-horizon agent behavior underexplored. This study aims to impose dynamical structure for temporal coherence.

Method: An affective subsystem maintains VAD state externally, using first- and second-order update rules. Affective signals are extracted and integrated via exponential smoothing/momentum, then injected into generation.

Result: Stateless agents lack coherence; first-order enables recovery. Second-order introduces inertia, balancing stability and responsiveness.

Conclusion: Affective dynamics enhance LLM agent coherence, with second-order dynamics offering a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often exhibit abrupt shifts in tone and persona during extended interaction, reflecting the absence of explicit temporal structure governing agent-level state. While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.

TL;DR: Combining vision-language models with external knowledge enhances detection of climate-related visual disinformation by leveraging up-to-date info like reverse image searches and fact-checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of VLMs in detecting climate disinformation due to outdated training knowledge by integrating external, current data sources.

Method: Integrate VLMs with external knowledge (reverse image results, fact-checks, expert content) to assess image claims more accurately.

Result: Improved ability to classify climate disinformation as accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach strengthens public science understanding by combating climate disinformation effectively in dynamic digital environments.

Abstract: Climate disinformation has become a major challenge in today digital world, especially with the rise of misleading images and videos shared widely on social media. These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable. This approach improves the model ability to handle real-world climate disinformation and supports efforts to protect public understanding of science in a rapidly changing information landscape.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic method for evaluating LLM prompts in educational settings, focusing on follow-up questions in dialogues. Six prompt templates were tested using a tournament-style evaluation, revealing one prompt significantly outperformed others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for evidence-based methods to design and evaluate LLM prompts for personalized and pedagogically aligned outputs in education.

Method: Used six prompt templates incorporating engineering patterns, tested via a Glicko2-rated tournament with eight judges evaluating across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and learner appropriateness.

Result: One prompt (strategic reading-focused) outperformed others, with win probabilities of 81% to 100%, combining persona and context manager patterns for metacognitive support.

Conclusion: The methodology advances evidence-based prompt development for educational LLM applications, moving beyond ad-hoc approaches.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common in educational applications, there is a growing need for evidence-based methods to design and evaluate LLM prompts that produce personalized and pedagogically aligned out-puts. This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.

TL;DR: Lightweight structural guidance improves neural theorem provers' performance by 43% on miniF2F.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether highly-trained neural theorem provers still benefit from simple structural guidance during inference.

Method: Evaluated a fixed prompt schedule over 15 common tactic skeletons on the miniF2F benchmark.

Result: Achieved 21.7% pass@16 compared to 15.2% for standard sampling, a 43% relative improvement.

Conclusion: Simple inference-time guidance is effective and complementary, indicating underutilization of structural priors.

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural theorem provers like DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 combine large language models with reinforcement learning, achieving impressive results through sophisticated training. We ask: do these highly-trained models still benefit from simple structural guidance at inference time? We evaluate a lightweight intervention -- a fixed prompt schedule over 15 common tactic skeletons -- on the miniF2F benchmark. This simple approach yields 21.7% pass@16 compared to 15.2% for standard sampling from the same model, a 43% relative improvement using the same number of samples (k=16) and same maximum generation length (1024 tokens). Our results suggest that even capable RL-trained provers underutilize structural priors available in the tactic language, and that simple inference-time guidance remains a cheap, complementary boost.

TL;DR: Dynamic board expansion in boardless games using a General Game System to avoid unnecessary complexity of static boards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional boardless games use oversized static boards, which are inefficient and complex. A dynamic solution is needed.

Method: Implementation of a General Game System to enable automatic board expansion during gameplay.

Result: Reduction in unnecessary complexity by dynamically growing the game board as needed.

Conclusion: Dynamic board expansion is a viable solution to improve efficiency in boardless games.

Abstract: This thesis explores the use of a General Game System (GGS) to support the automatic expansion of game boards in boardless games. Traditional implementations of such games often rely on oversized static boards defined from the start, even though large portions of these boards may never be used during gameplay. This approach leads to unnecessary complexity. To address this issue, this thesis propose a dynamic board expansion mechanism in which the game board grows automatically during play.

TL;DR: ELILLM enhances LLMs for structure-based drug design by integrating exploration and knowledge-guided decoding, improving molecular generation and binding affinity predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' limitations in understanding protein structures and generating valid molecules for drug design.

Method: Proposes ELILLM, a framework combining encoding, latent space exploration, and decoding, guided by Bayesian optimization and a position-aware surrogate model.

Result: ELILLM outperforms seven baselines on CrossDocked2020, showing effective exploration and high binding affinity.

Conclusion: ELILLM successfully enhances LLMs for SBDD by improving controlled exploration and chemical validity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong representation and reasoning capabilities, but their application to structure-based drug design (SBDD) is limited by insufficient understanding of protein structures and unpredictable molecular generation. To address these challenges, we propose Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference for LLMs (ELILLM), a framework that reinterprets the LLM generation process as an encoding, latent space exploration, and decoding workflow. ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods. These results demonstrate that ELILLM can effectively enhance LLMs capabilities for SBDD.

### [159] [Language Models Entangle Language and Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15337)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates how LLMs provide unequal response quality and cultural context across languages, revealing disparities favoring high-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure equitable response quality across languages and understand how language choice affects cultural context in LLM outputs.

Method: Using real-world questions from the WildChat dataset and CulturalBench benchmark, analyzed via LLM-as-a-Judge to assess quality and cultural context.

Result: LLMs deliver lower-quality answers in low-resource languages and exhibit language-dependent cultural context differences.

Conclusion: Language choice affects both answer quality and cultural context, highlighting disparities in LLM performance.

Abstract: Users should not be systemically disadvantaged by the language they use for interacting with LLMs; i.e. users across languages should get responses of similar quality irrespective of language used. In this work, we create a set of real-world open-ended questions based on our analysis of the WildChat dataset and use it to evaluate whether responses vary by language, specifically, whether answer quality depends on the language used to query the model. We also investigate how language and culture are entangled in LLMs such that choice of language changes the cultural information and context used in the response by using LLM-as-a-Judge to identify the cultural context present in responses. To further investigate this, we evaluate LLMs on a translated subset of the CulturalBench benchmark across multiple languages. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently provide lower quality answers to open-ended questions in low resource languages. We find that language significantly impacts the cultural context used by the model. This difference in context impacts the quality of the downstream answer.

### [160] [Improving MoE Compute Efficiency by Composing Weight and Data Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15370)
*Maciej Kilian,Oleg Mkrtchyan,Luke Zettlemoyer,Akshat Shrivastava,Armen Aghajanyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tokens activate subsets of experts in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers for compute efficiency. Data sparsity complements this by having experts process fewer tokens. Null experts enable causal MoE without train-inference mismatch, improving vision-language models efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in MoE layers by combining weight and data sparsity without violating causality, especially useful for heterogeneous data like vision-language tasks.

Method: Use zero-compute (null) experts in routing pools to enable data sparsity causally. Train with load balancing to uniformly distribute tokens among real and null experts.

Result: Combining weight and data sparsity improves compute efficiency, training loss, and downstream performance. Models implicitly prioritize text over vision tokens without explicit routing signals.

Conclusion: Causal MoE with null experts achieves better efficiency and performance than weight sparsity alone, particularly for tasks with heterogeneous token importance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts layers achieve compute efficiency through weight sparsity: each token activates only a subset of experts. Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of standard attention, such as implicit uniform priors and attention sinks, by leveraging Entropic Optimal Transport principles.

Method: Introduces GOAT, which replaces the uniform prior in attention with a learnable, continuous prior, maintaining compatibility with optimized kernels and solving attention sinks.

Result: GOAT learns an extrapolatable prior, combining flexibility of learned positional embeddings with length generalization of fixed encodings.

Conclusion: GOAT enhances attention mechanisms by introducing trainable priors, solving existing issues while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: We generalize the attention mechanism by viewing it through the lens of Entropic Optimal Transport, revealing that standard attention corresponds to a transport problem regularized by an implicit uniform prior. We introduce Generalized Optimal transport Attention with Trainable priors (GOAT), a new attention mechanism that replaces this naive assumption with a learnable, continuous prior. This prior maintains full compatibility with optimized kernels such as FlashAttention. GOAT also provides an EOT-based explanation of attention sinks and materializes a solution for them, avoiding the representational trade-offs of standard attention. Finally, by absorbing spatial information into the core attention computation, GOAT learns an extrapolatable prior that combines the flexibility of learned positional embeddings with the length generalization of fixed encodings.

TL;DR: FedUMM is a federated learning framework for unified multimodal models (UMMs) that addresses privacy and data distribution challenges using LoRA adapters, reducing communication costs while remaining competitive with centralized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized training of UMMs limits deployment in privacy-sensitive and geographically distributed scenarios due to data aggregation requirements.

Method: FedUMM leverages federated learning via parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA adapters, aggregating only adapter updates on the server.

Result: FedUMM maintains competitive performance with centralized training despite client heterogeneity, while reducing communication costs significantly.

Conclusion: This framework enables practical federated training of UMMs, offering insights for future privacy-preserving multimodal research.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) are emerging as strong foundation models that can do both generation and understanding tasks in a single architecture. However, they are typically trained in centralized settings where all training and downstream datasets are gathered in a central server, limiting the deployment in privacy-sensitive and geographically distributed scenarios. In this paper, we present FedUMM, a general federated learning framework for UMMs under non-IID multimodal data with low communication cost. Built on NVIDIA FLARE, FedUMM instantiates federation for a BLIP3o backbone via parameter-efficient fine-tuning: clients train lightweight LoRA adapters while freezing the foundation models, and the server aggregates only adapter updates. We evaluate on VQA v2 and the GenEval compositional generation benchmarks under Dirichlet-controlled heterogeneity with up to 16 clients. Results show slight degradation as client count and heterogeneity increase, while remaining competitive with centralized training. We further analyze computation--communication trade-offs and demonstrate that adapter-only federation reduces per-round communication by over an order of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning, enabling practical federated UMM training. This work provides empirical experience for future research on privacy-preserving federated unified multimodal models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a surrogate-assisted MOBO framework using attention-based job telemetry embeddings to optimize HPC scheduling for runtime and power trade-offs, outperforming baselines with data-efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPC schedulers need to balance user performance and resource constraints, requiring optimal node selection for jobs.

Method: Uses surrogate-assisted MOBO with attention-based job telemetry embeddings and intelligent sample acquisition.

Result: Achieved higher-quality Pareto fronts for runtime-power trade-offs and reduced training costs on production HPC datasets.

Conclusion: First successful application of embedding-informed surrogates in MOBO for HPC scheduling, optimizing performance and power.

Abstract: High-Performance Computing (HPC) schedulers must balance user performance with facility-wide resource constraints. The task boils down to selecting the optimal number of nodes for a given job. We present a surrogate-assisted multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to automate this complex decision. Our core hypothesis is that surrogate models informed by attention-based embeddings of job telemetry can capture performance dynamics more effectively than standard regression techniques. We pair this with an intelligent sample acquisition strategy to ensure the approach is data-efficient. On two production HPC datasets, our embedding-informed method consistently identified higher-quality Pareto fronts of runtime-power trade-offs compared to baselines. Furthermore, our intelligent data sampling strategy drastically reduced training costs while improving the stability of the results. To our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully apply embedding-informed surrogates in a MOBO framework to the HPC scheduling problem, jointly optimizing for performance and power on production workloads.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ambient Dataloops is an iterative framework refining datasets to improve diffusion model learning by progressively enhancing dataset quality and model performance using Ambient Diffusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern datasets have varying sample quality, leading to suboptimal model performance when trained on heterogeneous data.

Method: The framework involves a dataset-model co-evolution process, treating synthetically improved samples as noisy at decreasing levels each iteration and using Ambient Diffusion.

Result: Ambient Dataloops achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation and protein design.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves dataset quality and model performance, supported by theoretical justification.

Abstract: We propose Ambient Dataloops, an iterative framework for refining datasets that makes it easier for diffusion models to learn the underlying data distribution. Modern datasets contain samples of highly varying quality, and training directly on such heterogeneous data often yields suboptimal models. We propose a dataset-model co-evolution process; at each iteration of our method, the dataset becomes progressively higher quality, and the model improves accordingly. To avoid destructive self-consuming loops, at each generation, we treat the synthetically improved samples as noisy, but at a slightly lower noisy level than the previous iteration, and we use Ambient Diffusion techniques for learning under corruption. Empirically, Ambient Dataloops achieve state-of-the-art performance in unconditional and text-conditional image generation and de novo protein design. We further provide a theoretical justification for the proposed framework that captures the benefits of the data looping procedure.

*Lorian Bannis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lattice is a hybrid sequential prediction system using binary confidence gating to activate behavioral archetypes only when confident, improving performance over baselines in some cases while preventing false activations in others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To manage epistemic uncertainty in safety-critical applications by conditionally activating learned behavioral structures based on confidence thresholds.

Method: Clusters behavior windows into archetypes, uses binary confidence gating to activate archetype-based scoring when confident, and falls back to baseline predictions otherwise. Validated on recommendation systems, scientific time-series, and financial markets using LSTM and transformer backbones.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over baselines (e.g., +31.9% HR@10 on MovieLens with LSTM) and correctly refuses activation during distribution shifts, with neutral performance when structure is already present.

Conclusion: Confidence gating is a promising principle for managing uncertainty, effectively activating, refusing, or deferring based on pattern applicability.

Abstract: We introduce Lattice, a hybrid sequential prediction system that conditionally activates learned behavioral structure using binary confidence gating. The system clusters behavior windows into behavioral archetypes and uses binary confidence gating to activate archetype-based scoring only when confidence exceeds a threshold, falling back to baseline predictions when uncertain. We validate Lattice on recommendation systems (MovieLens), scientific time-series (LIGO), and financial markets, using LSTM and transformer backbones. On MovieLens with LSTM, Lattice achieves +31.9% improvement over LSTM baseline in HR@10 (p < 3.29 x 10^-25, 30 seeds), outperforming transformer baselines by 109.4% over SASRec and 218.6% over BERT4Rec. On LIGO and financial data, the system correctly refuses archetype activation when distribution shift occurs - a successful outcome demonstrating confidence gating prevents false activation. On transformer backbones, Lattice provides 0.0% improvement (neutral, no degradation), gracefully deferring when structure is already present. This bidirectional validation - activating when patterns apply, refusing when they don't, and deferring when redundant - supports confidence gating as a promising architectural principle for managing epistemic uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CASL introduces supervised alignment between latent dimensions of diffusion models and semantic concepts, improving interpretability and control over generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised SAE-based methods fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts, limiting reliable semantic control.

Method: CASL trains an SAE on U-Net activations, then learns a lightweight linear mapping to associate concepts with latent dimensions. It uses CASL-Steer for controlled interventions and introduces EPR for evaluation.

Result: CASL achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CASL is the first supervised framework aligning latent representations with semantic concepts in diffusion models, enhancing understanding and control.

Abstract: Internal activations of diffusion models encode rich semantic information, but interpreting such representations remains challenging. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in disentangling latent representations, existing SAE-based methods for diffusion model understanding rely on unsupervised approaches that fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts. This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve supervised alignment between latent representations and semantic concepts in diffusion models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of synthetic content contaminating natural data necessitates revisiting fundamental learning theory to understand its impact on learning algorithms.

Method: The study models learning tasks with mixed natural and synthetic data, evaluates ERM's performance, and introduces non-uniform weighting algorithms for comparison.

Result: ERM converges to the true mean but is outperformed by weighted algorithms. For PAC learning, ERM fails to converge, but alternative algorithms succeed.

Conclusion: Alternative algorithms can handle synthetic contamination better than ERM, highlighting the need for adaptive learning methods in mixed-data scenarios.

Abstract: The prevalence and low cost of LLMs have led to a rise of synthetic content. From review sites to court documents, ``natural'' content has been contaminated by data points that appear similar to natural data, but are in fact LLM-generated. In this work we revisit fundamental learning theory questions in this, now ubiquitous, setting. We model this scenario as a sequence of learning tasks where the input is a mix of natural and synthetic data, and the learning algorithms are oblivious to the origin of any individual example.
  We study the possibilities and limitations of ERM in this setting. For the problem of estimating the mean of an arbitrary $d$-dimensional distribution, we find that while ERM converges to the true mean, it is outperformed by an algorithm that assigns non-uniform weights to examples from different generations of data. For the PAC learning setting, the disparity is even more stark. We find that ERM does not always converge to the true concept, echoing the model collapse literature. However, we show there are algorithms capable of learning the correct hypothesis for arbitrary VC classes and arbitrary amounts of contamination.

TL;DR: Panther is a PyTorch-compatible library integrating RandNLA algorithms to compress deep learning models efficiently, offering significant memory savings (up to 75%) without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome GPU memory and compute constraints in modern deep learning models drives the development of Panther, leveraging RandNLA techniques.

Method: Panther provides drop-in replacements for standard PyTorch components (e.g., linear layers, convolution) using a custom C++/CUDA backend (pawX), optimized for CPUs and GPUs.

Result: Panther achieves up to 75% memory savings on models like BERT while maintaining comparable loss, demonstrating its effectiveness and ease of adoption.

Conclusion: Panther successfully integrates RandNLA algorithms into a unified, high-performance framework, enabling efficient model compression with minimal code changes.

Abstract: Training modern deep learning models is increasingly constrained by GPU memory and compute limits. While Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) offers proven techniques to compress these models, the lack of a unified, production-grade library prevents widely adopting these methods. We present Panther, a PyTorch-compatible library that consolidates established RandNLA algorithms into a single high-performance framework. Panther engineers efficient, drop-in replacements for standard components including sketched linear layers, 2D convolution, multi-head attention, and randomized matrix decompositions (such as pivoted CholeskyQR). By implementing a custom C++/CUDA backend (pawX), Panther provides an optimized implementation that can run on both CPUs and GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RandNLA techniques and Panther's ease of adoption. By replacing standard PyTorch linear layers with Panther layers (requiring only a few lines of code) we achieve significant memory savings (up to 75%) on BERT while maintaining comparable loss.

*Md Nabi Newaz Khan,Abdullah Arafat Miah,Yu Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification using subgraph injection instead of subgraph replacement, achieving high success rates with minimal impact on clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks for graph classification are limited to single-target attacks using subgraph replacement, leaving a gap for multi-target attacks.

Method: Proposes subgraph injection to poison graphs while preserving their original structure, testing efficacy across five datasets and four GNN models.

Result: Achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal clean accuracy impact, outperforming conventional subgraph replacement attacks.

Conclusion: Highlights GNN vulnerability to multi-targeted backdoor attacks and confirms the robustness of the proposed method against defenses.

Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) have demonstrated exceptional performance in solving critical problems across diverse domains yet remain susceptible to backdoor attacks. Existing studies on backdoor attack for graph classification are limited to single target attack using subgraph replacement based mechanism where the attacker implants only one trigger into the GNN model. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification task, where multiple triggers simultaneously redirect predictions to different target labels. Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios. Additionally, our evaluation against state-of-the-art defenses (randomized smoothing and fine-pruning) demonstrates the robustness of our proposed multi-target attacks. This work highlights the GNN vulnerability against multi-targeted backdoor attack in graph classification task.

*Jakub Antczak,James Montgomery,Małgorzata O'Reilly,Zbigniew Palmowski,Richard Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares SARIMAX, XGBoost, and LSTM models for forecasting emergency department (ED) arrivals, using data from an Australian hospital (2017–2021). It addresses COVID-19 distortions with synthetic data and finds all models outperform a baseline, with XGBoost excelling for total admissions and SARIMAX for complex cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency Department overcrowding compromises patient safety and efficiency, requiring accurate demand forecasting for better resource allocation.

Method: Evaluates SARIMAX, XGBoost, and LSTM models for forecasting daily ED arrivals over seven days. Uses hospital data (2017–2021), decomposes demand into eight wards, and stratifies by clinical complexity. Addresses COVID-19 distortions with Prophet-generated synthetic data.

Result: All models outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost achieves the highest accuracy for total admissions (MAE: 6.63), while SARIMAX is slightly better for major complexity cases (MAE: 3.77).

Conclusion: The models successfully predict regular patterns but underestimate sudden surges in patient volume.

Abstract: Emergency Department overcrowding is a critical issue that compromises patient safety and operational efficiency, necessitating accurate demand forecasting for effective resource allocation. This study evaluates and compares three distinct predictive models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon. Utilizing data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021, this research distinguishes itself by decomposing demand into eight specific ward categories and stratifying patients by clinical complexity. To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77. The study concludes that while these techniques successfully reproduce regular day-to-day patterns, they share a common limitation in underestimating sudden, infrequent surges in patient volume.

*Huayu Li,ZhengXiao He,Siyuan Tian,Jinghao Wen,Ao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MFS introduces a principled framework for LLM decoding, replacing heuristic methods with Martingale theory for better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in LLMs is short-sighted and heuristic-based; MFS aims to provide a theoretically-grounded solution.

Method: Models reasoning paths as stochastic processes, using Martingale theory for valuation, path selection, and stopping.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and computational efficiency on six reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: MFS offers a robust, theory-driven approach to improve LLM decoding.

Abstract: Standard autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) is inherently short-sighted, often failing to find globally optimal reasoning paths due to its token-by-token generation process. While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency. Code will be released at https://github.com/miraclehetech/EACL2026-Martingale-Foresight-Sampling.

*Jingwei Song,Xinyu Wang,Hanbin Wang,Xiaoxuan Lei,Bill Shi,Shixin Han,Eric Yang,Xiao-Wen Chang,Lynn Ai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Margin-Aware Speculative Verification improves LLM inference speed by adapting verification to the target model's decisiveness, reducing inefficiencies in token rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speculative decoding methods rely on strict token-level rejection, which is inefficient in low-margin regimes where the target model shows weak preference among top tokens.

Method: Proposes Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic strategy that adapts verification based on the target model's local decisiveness, measured from its logits.

Result: Experiments across model scales (8B to 235B) show consistent and significant inference speedups over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses inefficiencies in verification, improving speculative decoding performance without compromising output quality.

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive large language model (LLM) inference by decoupling generation and verification. While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks. Extensive experiments across model scales ranging from 8B to 235B demonstrate that our method delivers consistent and significant inference speedups over state-of-the-art baselines while preserving generation quality across diverse benchmarks.

*Rishit Chatterjee,Tahiya Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses forecasting challenges in volunteer-led lake monitoring by focusing on Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) using ridge regression, identifying minimal sample sizes and feature sets to achieve accuracy within 5% of full benchmarks, and proposing a joint feasibility strategy for efficient lake monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Volunteer-led lake monitoring data is irregular and sparse due to natural and human factors, making forecasting harmful algal blooms difficult. The study aims to improve forecasting accuracy with constrained data.

Method: The study analyzes a 30-lake dataset using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) for missing data. Ridge regression is evaluated among six models, and minimal sample sizes and feature sets are identified to achieve accuracy targets.

Result: Ridge regression performs best. Achieving within 5% accuracy requires ~176 training samples per lake or ~64 recent samples with just one predictor. A compact four-feature subset matches the baseline performance.

Conclusion: A joint feasibility function optimizes monitoring by unifying feature choice and sample history under accuracy constraints, offering practical guidance for lake researchers to prioritize sampling efforts efficiently.

Abstract: Volunteer-led lake monitoring yields irregular, seasonal time series with many gaps arising from ice cover, weather-related access constraints, and occasional human errors, complicating forecasting and early warning of harmful algal blooms. We study Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) forecasting on a 30-lake, data-rich subset drawn from three decades of in situ records collected across Maine lakes. Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring. Hence, our joint feasibility strategy unifies recent-history length and feature choice under a fixed accuracy target, yielding a simple, efficient rule for setting sampling effort and measurement priorities for lake researchers.

Motivation: To develop a computational model that captures spatially conditioned regulatory relationships in spatial transcriptomics data.

Method: SAGE-FM is a graph convolutional network (GCN) model trained with a masked central spot prediction objective on 416 human Visium samples from 15 organs.

Result: The model achieves 91% significant gene recovery (p < 0.05) and outperforms MOFA and other methods in clustering and biological heterogeneity preservation. It also improves downstream task performance (81% accuracy in cancer annotation and better glioblastoma subtype prediction).

Conclusion: Simple, parameter-efficient GCNs like SAGE-FM can serve as interpretable and spatially aware foundation models for large-scale spatial transcriptomics.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables spatial gene expression profiling, motivating computational models that capture spatially conditioned regulatory relationships. We introduce SAGE-FM, a lightweight spatial transcriptomics foundation model based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) trained with a masked central spot prediction objective. Trained on 416 human Visium samples spanning 15 organs, SAGE-FM learns spatially coherent embeddings that robustly recover masked genes, with 91% of masked genes showing significant correlations (p < 0.05). The embeddings generated by SAGE-FM outperform MOFA and existing spatial transcriptomics methods in unsupervised clustering and preservation of biological heterogeneity. SAGE-FM generalizes to downstream tasks, enabling 81% accuracy in pathologist-defined spot annotation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and improving glioblastoma subtype prediction relative to MOFA. In silico perturbation experiments further demonstrate that the model captures directional ligand-receptor and upstream-downstream regulatory effects consistent with ground truth. These results demonstrate that simple, parameter-efficient GCNs can serve as biologically interpretable and spatially aware foundation models for large-scale spatial transcriptomics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning approach improves diagnosis accuracy for atypical Alzheimer's disease (atAD) by leveraging clinical testing and MRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods often misdiagnose atypical Alzheimer's disease (atAD). The study aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy using clinical and MRI data.

Method: Developed a machine learning model using clinical testing and MRI features (including hippocampal volume) from 1410 subjects across multiple data sets.

Result: Incorporating additional MRI features improved recall for atAD diagnosis significantly (52% to 69% and 34% to 77%).

Conclusion: The ML approach enhances diagnostic accuracy for atypical Alzheimer's disease using non-invasive clinical and MRI data.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), defined as an abnormal buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on protein biomarkers via PET or CSF analysis. However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.

*Himanshu Mishra,Kanwal Mehreen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how low-bit quantization can undo machine unlearning and proposes a quantization-aware method to prevent forgotten information from being restored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning is essential for removing sensitive data from models without retraining, but quantization often reverses this process, making it ineffective.

Method: The authors analyze weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps, then introduce a logits space hinge loss to ensure forgotten examples remain distinguishable post-quantization.

Result: Tests on language and classification tasks, including Twitter misinformation data, show the method successfully preserves unlearning under 4-bit quantization, unlike existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed quantization-aware unlearning method effectively mitigates the issue of forgotten information being restored during quantization.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge (e.g., copyrighted or private data) from a trained model without full retraining. In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization. We evaluate on language and classification tasks (including a Twitter misinformation dataset) and show our method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing methods almost entirely recover the forgotten knowledge.

TL;DR: Prism is a white-box Transformer architecture using geometric inductive biases for interpretability and performance, demonstrating unsupervised functional disentanglement in attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of interpretability in deep learning models like Transformers by proposing Prism, a white-box architecture grounded in geometric principles.

Method: Develop Prism with attention modeled as gradient ascent on a signal-noise manifold, incorporating an overcomplete dictionary and irrational frequency separation ($π$-RoPE) for geometric constraints.

Result: Prism's attention heads specialize into spectrally distinct regimes (low-frequency for causal dependencies, high-frequency for syntactic constraints) without supervision.

Conclusion: Interpretability and performance can coexist through principled geometric construction, as shown by Prism's functional disentanglement.

Abstract: Deep learning models, particularly Transformers, are often criticized as "black boxes" and lack interpretability. We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($π$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance are not a trade-off, but can be unified through principled geometric construction.

*Himanshu Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RDumb++ extends RDumb with drift-detection mechanisms (entropy and KL-divergence scoring) and adaptive resets to stabilize Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) over long horizons and rapid shifts, achieving ~3% higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods (e.g., Tent, EATA) struggle with rapid or prolonged distribution shifts, as shown by the CCC benchmark. RDumb++ aims to prevent prediction collapse and maintain stable adaptation.

Method: RDumb++ introduces two drift-detection mechanisms (entropy-based and KL-divergence scoring) and adaptive reset strategies to detect harmful adaptation and recover before collapse.

Result: On CCC-medium (9 runs), RDumb++ outperforms RDumb by ~3% accuracy, maintaining stable adaptation. Ablations confirm drift-aware resets are crucial for long-horizon CTTA.

Conclusion: RDumb++ effectively addresses long-horizon CTTA challenges by integrating drift detection and adaptive resets, preventing collapse and improving accuracy.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) seeks to update a pretrained model during deployment using only the incoming, unlabeled data stream. Although prior approaches such as Tent, EATA etc. provide meaningful improvements under short evolving shifts, they struggle when the test distribution changes rapidly or over extremely long horizons. This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream. Ablation experiments on drift thresholds and reset strengths further show that drift-aware resetting is essential for preventing collapse and achieving reliable long-horizon CTTA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using clinically-tailored metrics for ML optimization outperforms traditional validation loss in healthcare tasks, aligning better with clinical goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML validation loss doesn't align with healthcare-specific clinical requirements, motivating the use of tailored metrics.

Method: Two controlled experiments compare model optimization using clinically-tailored metrics versus validation loss.

Result: Clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization, improving performance on clinical tasks.

Conclusion: Extra effort to define and implement clinically-relevant metrics is justified by better clinical performance.

Abstract: A key task in ML is to optimize models at various stages, e.g. by choosing hyperparameters or picking a stopping point. A traditional ML approach is to use validation loss, i.e. to apply the training loss function on a validation set to guide these optimizations. However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline. But it can yield models that better meet the central goal of ML for healthcare: strong performance in the clinic.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scientific applications often deal with incomplete data due to various constraints, limiting the applicability of existing neural operators that assume fully-observed inputs.

Method: LANO employs a mask-to-predict training strategy and a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator for autoregressive generation in latent space. It also introduces POBench-PDE for benchmarking.

Result: LANO achieves 18--69% relative L2 error reduction under partial observation conditions, including real-world climate prediction, and handles up to 75% missing data.

Conclusion: LANO effectively bridges the gap between idealized research and real-world scientific computing, improving neural operator performance under partial observations.

Abstract: Real-world scientific applications frequently encounter incomplete observational data due to sensor limitations, geographic constraints, or measurement costs. Although neural operators significantly advanced PDE solving in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, their underlying assumption of fully-observed spatial inputs severely restricts applicability in real-world applications. We introduce the first systematic framework for learning neural operators from partial observation. We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator~(\ours) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space. Additionally, we develop POBench-PDE, a dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for evaluating neural operators under partial observation conditions across three PDE-governed tasks. \ours achieves state-of-the-art performance with 18--69$\%$ relative L2 error reduction across all benchmarks under patch-wise missingness with less than 50$\%$ missing rate, including real-world climate prediction. Our approach effectively addresses practical scenarios involving up to 75$\%$ missing rate, to some extent bridging the existing gap between idealized research settings and the complexities of real-world scientific computing.

Result: Experiments show E2E-PIL outperforms E2E-BB, and E2E-BPIL further improves results. Embedding heuristic structures reduces model complexity and enhances learning efficiency without significant flexibility loss.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based tools are more effective when guided by human knowledge, emphasizing the value of combining advanced analytics with inventory theory.

Abstract: Managing perishable products with limited lifetimes is a fundamental challenge in inventory management, as poor ordering decisions can quickly lead to stockouts or excessive waste. We study a perishable inventory system with random lead times in which both the demand process and the lead time distribution are unknown. We consider a practical setting where orders are placed using limited historical data together with observed covariates and current system states. To improve learning efficiency under limited data, we adopt a marginal cost accounting scheme that assigns each order a single lifetime cost and yields a unified loss function for end-to-end learning. This enables training a deep learning-based policy that maps observed covariates and system states directly to order quantities. We develop two end-to-end variants: a purely black-box approach that outputs order quantities directly (E2E-BB), and a structure-guided approach that embeds the projected inventory level (PIL) policy, capturing inventory effects through explicit computation rather than additional learning (E2E-PIL). We further show that the objective induced by E2E-PIL is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a boosting technique from operational data analytics (ODA) that yields an enhanced policy (E2E-BPIL). Experiments on synthetic and real data establish a robust performance ordering: E2E-BB is dominated by E2E-PIL, which is further improved by E2E-BPIL. Using an excess-risk decomposition, we show that embedding heuristic policy structure reduces effective model complexity and improves learning efficiency with only a modest loss of flexibility. More broadly, our results suggest that deep learning-based decision tools are more effective and robust when guided by human knowledge, highlighting the value of integrating advanced analytics with inventory theory.

*Liusha Yang,Siqi Zhao,Shuqi Chai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural network-based nonlinear shrinkage estimator for covariance matrices improves minimum variance portfolio optimization by combining statistical and machine learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance portfolio risk minimization by leveraging the strengths of both statistical estimation and machine learning, addressing limitations of traditional methods like the Ledoit-Wolf estimator.

Method: Decomposes the Ledoit-Wolf covariance matrix into eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then applies a transformer-based neural network to learn a nonlinear eigenvalue shrinkage function, trained using portfolio risk as the loss function.

Result: The method achieves consistently lower out-of-sample realized risk in empirical tests on S&P500 stock returns compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating structural statistical models with data-driven learning shows promise for improving portfolio optimization.

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural network-based nonlinear shrinkage estimator of covariance matrices for the purpose of minimum variance portfolio optimization. It is a hybrid approach that integrates statistical estimation with machine learning. Starting from the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) shrinkage estimator, we decompose the LW covariance matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and apply a lightweight transformer-based neural network to learn a nonlinear eigenvalue shrinkage function. Trained with portfolio risk as the loss function, the resulting precision matrix (the inverse covariance matrix) estimator directly targets portfolio risk minimization. By conditioning on the sample-to-dimension ratio, the approach remains scalable across different sample sizes and asset universes. Empirical results on stock daily returns from Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P500) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower out-of-sample realized risk than benchmark approaches. This highlights the promise of integrating structural statistical models with data-driven learning.

*Mingyuan Fan,Weiguang Han,Daixin Wang,Cen Chen,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR is a method to enhance LLMs in logic-heavy tasks, but it may cause over-sharpening, where policies focus on limited modes. Proposed solutions include inverse-success advantage and distribution-level calibration, which improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify whether RLVR introduces new capabilities or just sharpens existing knowledge, addressing the issue of over-sharpening.

Method: The authors formalize over-sharpening and propose inverse-success advantage calibration and distribution-level calibration to diversify sampling.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the proposed strategies effectively mitigate over-sharpening and improve generalization.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the risks of over-sharpening in RLVR and demonstrate that the proposed calibration methods enhance model performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a central paradigm for turning large language models (LLMs) into reliable problem solvers, especially in logic-heavy domains. Despite its empirical success, it remains unclear whether RLVR elicits novel capabilities or merely sharpens the distribution over existing knowledge. We study this by formalizing over-sharpening, a phenomenon where the policy collapses onto limited modes, suppressing valid alternatives. At a high level, we discover finite-batch updates intrinsically bias learning toward sampled modes, triggering a collapse that propagates globally via semantic coupling. To mitigate this, we propose inverse-success advantage calibration to prioritize difficult queries and distribution-level calibration to diversify sampling via a memory network. Empirical evaluations validate that our strategies can effectively improve generalization.

### [185] [Closing the Gap on the Sample Complexity of 1-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15620)
*Zitian Li,Wang Chi Cheung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the 1-identification problem in multi-armed bandits, ensuring correct identification of a qualified arm or outputting 'None' with high probability, while minimizing expected pulling times. It provides a new lower bound and an efficient algorithm with tight upper bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the open problem of analyzing expected pulling times when multiple qualified arms exist, improving upon existing literature.

Method: The authors use an optimization formulation to derive a new lower bound and design an algorithm with tight upper bounds.

Result: The results show tight bounds with logarithmic gaps across all problem instances.

Conclusion: The work complements historical literature by solving the open problem of analyzing expected pulling times for multiple qualified arms.

Abstract: 1-identification is a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure exploration. An agent aims to determine whether there exists a qualified arm whose mean reward is not less than a known threshold $μ_0$, or to output \textsf{None} if it believes such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct with probability at least $1-δ$, while making expected total pulling times $\mathbb{E}τ$ as small as possible. We work on 1-identification with two main contributions. (1) We utilize an optimization formulation to derive a new lower bound of $\mathbb{E}τ$, when there is at least one qualified arm. (2) We design a new algorithm, deriving tight upper bounds whose gap to lower bounds are up to a polynomial of logarithm factor across all problem instance. Our result complements the analysis of $\mathbb{E}τ$ when there are multiple qualified arms, which is an open problem left by history literature.

*Zhiwei Zhang,Fei Zhao,Rui Wang,Zezhong Wang,Bin Liang,Jiakang Wang,Yao Hu,Shaosheng Cao,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fission-GRPO improves LLMs' error recovery in multi-turn tool execution by converting errors into corrective supervision during RL training, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with error recovery during multi-turn tool execution, hindering real-world reliability. Existing RL and synthetic datasets fail to address this effectively.

Method: Proposes Fission-GRPO, which augments failed trajectories with feedback from an Error Simulator and resamples recovery rollouts on-policy during RL training.

Result: Achieves a 5.7% higher error recovery rate and 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO on BFCL v4 Multi-Turn.

Conclusion: Fission-GRPO enhances LLMs' ability to recover from errors dynamically, improving reliability in tool-use scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can call tools effectively, yet they remain brittle in multi-turn execution: following a tool call error, smaller models often degenerate into repetitive invalid re-invocations, failing to interpret error feedback and self-correct. This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Bayesian optimisation efficiency by exploiting historic datasets through transfer learning methods.

Method: Empirical analysis of ensemble-based transfer learning methods, proposing weighted predictions with regularised regression and positive constraints.

Result: Warm start initialisation and positive weight constraints enhance transfer learning Bayesian optimisation performance.

Conclusion: Specific pipeline components like weighted ensemble predictions and positive constraints significantly improve Bayesian optimisation outcomes.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation is a sample efficient method for finding a global optimum of expensive black-box objective functions. Historic datasets from related problems can be exploited to help improve performance of Bayesian optimisation by adapting transfer learning methods to various components of the Bayesian optimisation pipeline. In this study we perform an empirical analysis of various ensemble-based transfer learning Bayesian optimisation methods and pipeline components. We expand on previous work in the literature by contributing some specific pipeline components, and three new real-time transfer learning Bayesian optimisation benchmarks. In particular we propose to use a weighting strategy for ensemble surrogate model predictions based on regularised regression with weights constrained to be positive, and a related component for handling the case when transfer learning is not improving Bayesian optimisation performance. We find that in general, two components that help improve transfer learning Bayesian optimisation performance are warm start initialisation and constraining weights used with ensemble surrogate model to be positive.

*Jingjing Bai,Yoshinobu Kawahara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dualformer, a dual-domain framework for long-term time series forecasting, addresses the low-pass filtering effect in Transformers by preserving high-frequency details and balancing time-frequency features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models lose high-frequency information in time series forecasting due to undifferentiated frequency propagation across layers, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Dualformer introduces a dual-branch architecture for concurrent time and frequency domain modeling, hierarchical frequency sampling, and a dynamic periodicity-aware weighting mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks show Dualformer's superior performance, especially on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data.

Conclusion: Dualformer effectively preserves high-frequency details and enhances generalization, proving robust for long-term time series forecasting.

Abstract: Transformer-based models, despite their promise for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), suffer from an inherent low-pass filtering effect that limits their effectiveness. This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Akira-221/Dualformer.

*Xinyu Wang,Sicheng Lyu,Yu Gu,Jerry Huang,Peng Lu,Yufei Cui,Xiao-Wen Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLSEdit introduces an efficient recursive least-squares editor for long sequential edits in LLMs, balancing plasticity and stability while scaling to 10K edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model editors struggle with the plasticity-stability dilemma in sequential edits, leading to interference or loss of past edits and general capabilities.

Method: RLSEdit formulates editing as online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, using recursive least-squares updates for efficiency.

Result: RLSEdit scales to 10K edits, outperforming baselines in edit success and stability, preserving early edits and general capabilities.

Conclusion: RLSEdit offers a practical solution for long sequential edits in LLMs, balancing adherence to new facts with preservation of general capabilities.

Abstract: Model editing updates a pre-trained LLM with new facts or rules without re-training, while preserving unrelated behavior. In real deployment, edits arrive as long streams, and existing editors often face a plasticity-stability dilemma: locate-then-edit "hard writes" can accumulate interference over time, while null-space-style "hard preservation" preserves only what is explicitly constrained, so past edits can be overwritten and unconstrained behaviors may deviate, degrading general capabilities in the many-edits regime. We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate stable scaling to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in both edit success and holistic stability -- crucially retaining early edits, and preserving general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks.

*Ryoma Sato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Zero-Error Horizon (ZEH) to measure the error-free range of LLMs, revealing surprising limitations in state-of-the-art models like GPT-5.2 despite their advanced capabilities. It also explores ZEH's correlation with accuracy and computational cost mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the trustworthiness of LLMs by defining and evaluating their Zero-Error Horizon (ZEH), highlighting unexpected weaknesses in simple tasks for models like GPT-5.2.

Method: Proposes ZEH as a metric, evaluates it on models like GPT-5.2 and Qwen2.5, and analyzes the insights. Computational cost mitigation techniques like tree structures and online softmax are discussed.

Result: ZEH reveals surprising limitations in advanced models (e.g., GPT-5.2 fails on basic tasks like parity checks). ZEH correlates with accuracy but differs in detailed behaviors, offering insights into algorithmic capabilities.

Conclusion: ZEH is a valuable tool for understanding LLM trustworthiness, showing unexpected flaws in simple tasks. Mitigating ZEH's computational cost is feasible, enhancing its practical utility.

Abstract: We propose Zero-Error Horizon (ZEH) for trustworthy LLMs, which represents the maximum range that a model can solve without any errors. While ZEH itself is simple, we demonstrate that evaluating the ZEH of state-of-the-art LLMs yields abundant insights. For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax.

TL;DR: CeFGC is a novel Federated GNN paradigm that reduces communication overhead to three rounds by using generative diffusion models for efficient training on non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing high communication overhead and non-IID data challenges in Federated GNNs.

Method: Leverages generative diffusion models to capture local graph distributions, shared among clients and server, enabling synthetic graph generation for local GNN training and weight aggregation.

Result: CeFGC reduces communication to three rounds and shows superior performance on non-IID graphs.

Conclusion: CeFGC effectively aligns local and global objectives while enriching training data, proving efficient and outperforming competitors.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) unlock new ways of learning from graph-structured data, proving highly effective in capturing complex relationships and patterns. Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs.

TL;DR: The paper surveys the use of LLMs and agentic systems for automating kernel generation and optimization, highlighting advancements, fragmentation in the field, and providing a structured overview and open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems rely on high-quality kernels, but kernel engineering is time-consuming and non-scalable. LLMs and agentic systems offer potential for automation by leveraging expert-level knowledge and iterative optimization.

Method: The survey compiles existing LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, along with datasets and benchmarks, to provide a structured overview of the field.

Result: A systematic perspective on LLM-driven kernel generation is presented, addressing fragmentation and offering insights into current advancements.

Conclusion: The paper aims to serve as a reference for future research in automated kernel optimization, outlining key challenges and maintaining an open-source repository for tracking progress.

Abstract: The performance of modern AI systems is fundamentally constrained by the quality of their underlying kernels, which translate high-level algorithmic semantics into low-level hardware operations. Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization. To keep track of this field, we maintain an open-source GitHub repository at https://github.com/flagos-ai/awesome-LLM-driven-kernel-generation.

TL;DR: GenRel-DDI is a relation-centric learning framework for drug-drug interaction prediction, outperforming existing methods by focusing on transferable interaction patterns rather than drug identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DDI prediction methods struggle with generalization to unseen drugs and scarce interactions in real-world scenarios, highlighting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: GenRel-DDI reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, learning interaction representations independently of drug identities to capture transferable patterns.

Result: GenRel-DDI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in entity-disjoint evaluations, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Relation-centric learning (GenRel-DDI) effectively addresses limitations of molecule-centric models, offering robust and generalizable DDI prediction.

Abstract: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is central to drug discovery and clinical development, particularly in the context of increasingly prevalent polypharmacy. Although existing computational methods achieve strong performance on standard benchmarks, they often fail to generalize to realistic deployment scenarios, where most candidate drug pairs involve previously unseen drugs and validated interactions are scarce. We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction.

Motivation: To address the limitations of LLM-generated labels in active learning, leveraging multiple LLMs can enhance annotation quality and robustness.

Method: The framework replaces human annotators with a Mixture-of-LLMs model, uses annotation discrepancy and negative learning to handle noisy labels, and operates on lightweight LLMs.

Result: The framework achieves performance comparable to human annotation and outperforms single-LLM and other ensemble-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a cost-effective and robust solution for active learning by leveraging multiple LLMs, with practical applicability on local machines.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement and strong generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they have been increasingly incorporated into the active learning pipelines as annotators to reduce annotation costs. However, considering the annotation quality, labels generated by LLMs often fall short of real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a novel active learning framework, Mixture of LLMs in the Loop Active Learning, replacing human annotators with labels generated through a Mixture-of-LLMs-based annotation model, aimed at enhancing LLM-based annotation robustness by aggregating the strengths of multiple LLMs. To further mitigate the impact of the noisy labels, we introduce annotation discrepancy and negative learning to identify the unreliable annotations and enhance learning effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves performance comparable to human annotation and consistently outperforms single-LLM baselines and other LLM-ensemble-based approaches. Moreover, our framework is built on lightweight LLMs, enabling it to operate fully on local machines in real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the fragility of safety guardrails in LLMs by proposing GOSV, a framework to identify safety-critical attention heads through global optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for understanding LLM safety rely on local, greedy attribution, ignoring cooperative interactions between components.

Method: Introduces GOSV, using global optimization with Harmful Patching and Zero Ablation to identify distinct safety vectors.

Result: Identified separate functional pathways for safety in LLMs, with complete safety breakdown occurring when 30% of heads are repatched.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of GOSV through a novel jailbreak method, outperforming existing white-box attacks.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to mitigate risks, their safety guardrails remain fragile against jailbreak attacks. This reveals limited understanding of components governing safety. Existing methods rely on local, greedy attribution that assumes independent component contributions. However, they overlook the cooperative interactions between different components in LLMs, such as attention heads, which jointly contribute to safety mechanisms. We propose \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{O}ptimization for \textbf{S}afety \textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously. We employ two complementary activation repatching strategies: Harmful Patching and Zero Ablation. These strategies identify two spatially distinct sets of safety vectors with consistently low overlap, termed Malicious Injection Vectors and Safety Suppression Vectors, demonstrating that aligned LLMs maintain separate functional pathways for safety purposes. Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching. Our attack substantially outperforms existing white-box attacks across all test models, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed GOSV framework on LLM safety interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray dark-field radiography offers additional diagnostic insights but lacks sufficient data for robust deep learning models.

Method: An Uncertainty-Guided Progressive Generative Adversarial Network is used, incorporating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.

Result: Generated images show high structural fidelity, improved quantitative metrics, and strong generalization in out-of-distribution tests.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-guided generative modeling effectively synthesizes realistic dark-field images, promising clinical utility.

Abstract: X-ray dark-field radiography provides complementary diagnostic information to conventional attenuation imaging by visualizing microstructural tissue changes through small-angle scattering. However, the limited availability of such data poses challenges for developing robust deep learning models. In this work, we present the first framework for generating dark-field images directly from standard attenuation chest X-rays using an Uncertainty-Guided Progressive Generative Adversarial Network. The model incorporates both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to improve interpretability and reliability. Experiments demonstrate high structural fidelity of the generated images, with consistent improvement of quantitative metrics across stages. Furthermore, out-of-distribution evaluation confirms that the proposed model generalizes well. Our results indicate that uncertainty-guided generative modeling enables realistic dark-field image synthesis and provides a reliable foundation for future clinical applications.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the unsustainable scaling of inference costs in large AI models by revealing localized gradient updates and decomposable structures, proposing a method to remove unsupported dependencies for parallel inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce inference cost and system complexity in large AI models by leveraging their inherent structural non-uniformity.

Method: Introduces a post-training statistical criterion and structural annealing to identify and remove unsupported dependencies, revealing stable substructures.

Result: Enables structured, parallel inference without altering model functionality or interfaces.

Conclusion: Establishes a model-agnostic structural view of inference systems, improving scalability.

Abstract: Inference in large-scale AI models is typically performed on dense parameter matrices, leading to inference cost and system complexity that scale unsustainably with model size. This limitation does not arise from insufficient model capacity, but from treating post-training inference systems as monolithic operators while ignoring internal structures formed during learning. We show that gradient update events in large models are highly localized and selective, leaving many parameter dependencies statistically indistinguishable from their initialization distribution after training. As a result, post-training inference systems are structurally non-uniform and inherently decomposable. Based on this observation, we introduce a post-training statistical criterion and a structural annealing procedure that removes unsupported dependencies and reveals stable, independent substructures. This work establishes a post-training, model-agnostic structural view of inference systems and enables structured, parallel inference without modifying model functionality or interfaces.

Conclusion: MIAs are less effective on tabular data than previously thought but remain a significant threat for single-outs and benefit from surrogate models.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are currently a dominant approach for evaluating privacy in machine learning applications. Despite their significance in identifying records belonging to the training dataset, several concerns remain unexplored, particularly with regard to tabular data. In this paper, first, we provide an extensive review and analysis of MIAs considering two main learning paradigms: centralized and federated learning. We extend and refine the taxonomy for both. Second, we demonstrate the efficacy of MIAs in tabular data using several attack strategies, also including defenses. Furthermore, in a federated learning scenario, we consider the threat posed by an outsider adversary, which is often neglected. Third, we demonstrate the high vulnerability of single-outs (records with a unique signature) to MIAs. Lastly, we explore how MIAs transfer across model architectures. Our results point towards a general poor performance of these attacks in tabular data which contrasts with previous state-of-the-art. Notably, even attacks with limited attack performance can still successfully expose a large portion of single-outs. Moreover, our findings suggest that using different surrogate models makes MIAs more effective.

*Simon W. Penninga,Ruud J. G. van Sloun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Iterative Amortized Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder (IA-HVAE), combining amortized inference with iterative refinement for faster, more accurate results in tasks like deblurring and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon traditional Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder (HVAE) by integrating amortized inference with iterative refinement for better performance in real-time applications and inverse problems.

Method: Develops IA-HVAE with a hybrid scheme: initial amortized guess followed by iterative refinement using decoder gradients, leveraging a linearly separable decoder in a transform domain (e.g., Fourier space).

Result: Achieves a 35x speed-up in iterative inference compared to traditional HVAE, outperforms fully amortized and iterative methods in accuracy and speed, and improves reconstruction quality in inverse problems.

Conclusion: IA-HVAE offers a significant advancement over traditional methods by balancing speed and accuracy, making it highly effective for real-time applications and inverse problem-solving.

Abstract: In this paper we propose the Iterative Amortized Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder (IA-HVAE), which expands on amortized inference with a hybrid scheme containing an initial amortized guess and iterative refinement with decoder gradients. We achieve this by creating a linearly separable decoder in a transform domain (e.g. Fourier space), enabling real-time applications with very high model depths. The architectural change leads to a 35x speed-up for iterative inference with respect to the traditional HVAE. We show that our hybrid approach outperforms fully amortized and fully iterative equivalents in accuracy and speed respectively. Moreover, the IAHVAE shows improved reconstruction quality over a vanilla HVAE in inverse problems such as deblurring and denoising.

### [200] [Predicting Healthcare System Visitation Flow by Integrating Hospital Attributes and Population Socioeconomics with Human Mobility Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15977)
*Binbin Lin,Lei Zou,Hao Tian,Heng Cai,Yifan Yang,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study integrates hospital attributes, socioeconomics, and spatial factors to predict healthcare visitation patterns, finding Deep Gravity the best model and highlighting varying influences like convenience and hospital ratings across distances and demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the fragmented approach in existing research by examining hospital capacities, SES, and spatial mobility together to understand visitation flows.

Method: Used SafeGraph mobility data and Google Maps Reviews to train five models (Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, MLPs, Deep Gravity, HGNN) for simulating Houston visitation flows, with SHAP and PDP analyses.

Result: Deep Gravity performed best. Hospital capacities, ICU rates, ratings, and popularity impact visitation differently by distance. SES and demographics (e.g., Hispanic, Black populations) also affect patterns.

Conclusion: Visitation patterns are shaped by a mix of convenience, hospital reputation, and SES, with Deep Gravity offering robust predictions and insights for healthcare planning.

Abstract: Healthcare visitation patterns are influenced by a complex interplay of hospital attributes, population socioeconomics, and spatial factors. However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.

### [201] [Partially Lazy Gradient Descent for Smoothed Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15984)
*Naram Mhaisen,George Iosifidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: $k$-lazyGD is an online learning algorithm balancing greedy OGD and lazy GD, achieving optimal dynamic regret in SOCO with adaptable laziness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between reactive greedy updates (OGD) and stable lazy updates (GD), enabling adaptable performance based on comparator shifts.

Method: Introduces $k$-lazyGD, analyzed via the FTRL framework, with a slack parameter $k$ adjusted up to $Θ(\\sqrt{T/P_T})$.

Result: Achieves optimal dynamic regret $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{(P_T+1)T})$ for adaptable laziness, without sacrificing hitting performance.

Conclusion: $k$-lazyGD formalizes the trade-off between laziness and tracking, enabling stable yet agile learning.

Abstract: We introduce $k$-lazyGD, an online learning algorithm that bridges the gap between greedy Online Gradient Descent (OGD, for $k=1$) and lazy GD/dual-averaging (for $k=T$), creating a spectrum between reactive and stable updates. We analyze this spectrum in Smoothed Online Convex Optimization (SOCO), where the learner incurs both hitting and movement costs. Our main contribution is establishing that laziness is possible without sacrificing hitting performance: we prove that $k$-lazyGD achieves the optimal dynamic regret $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(P_T+1)T})$ for any laziness slack $k$ up to $Θ(\sqrt{T/P_T})$, where $P_T$ is the comparator path length. This result formally connects the allowable laziness to the comparator's shifts, showing that $k$-lazyGD can retain the inherently small movements of lazy methods without compromising tracking ability. We base our analysis on the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework, and derive a matching lower bound. Since the slack depends on $P_T$, an ensemble of learners with various slacks is used, yielding a method that is provably stable when it can be, and agile when it must be.

### [202] [Data-Driven Conditional Flexibility Index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16028)
*Moritz Wedemeyer,Eike Cramer,Alexander Mitsos,Manuel Dahmen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Conditional Flexibility Index (CFI), extending the traditional flexibility index by using contextual information and data-driven admissible uncertainty sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flexibility indices use simple uncertainty sets (e.g., hypercubes) without leveraging contextual data. This limits their ability to provide robust scheduling decisions.

Method: CFI learns parametrized admissible uncertainty sets from historical data and uses contextual information (via normalizing flows) to map latent hyperspheres to data space.

Result: CFI provides more informative flexibility estimates by focusing on relevant uncertainty regions. Illustrative examples show no universal superiority but confirm practical benefits.

Conclusion: CFI improves scheduling quality by incorporating temporal and contextual information, demonstrating its value in applications like security-constrained unit commitment.

Abstract: With the increasing flexibilization of processes, determining robust scheduling decisions has become an important goal. Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information.

*Ricardo N. Ferreira,Cláudia Soares,João Xavier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLASP, an algorithm for COCO, minimizes loss and squared constraint violations, achieving logarithmic guarantees for strongly convex problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of minimizing cumulative loss and constraint violations in COCO by leveraging convex projectors' properties.

Method: Introduce CLASP, using firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors for analysis, optimizing regret and penalties.

Result: For convex losses, CLASP achieves sublinear regret and penalties; for strongly convex cases, it guarantees logarithmic bounds.

Conclusion: CLASP offers improved performance in COCO, especially for strongly convex problems, with logarithmic regret and penalty guarantees.

Abstract: We study Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO), where a learner chooses actions iteratively, observes both unanticipated convex loss and convex constraint, and accumulates loss while incurring penalties for constraint violations. We introduce CLASP (Convex Losses And Squared Penalties), an algorithm that minimizes cumulative loss together with squared constraint violations. Our analysis departs from prior work by fully leveraging the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, a proof strategy not previously applied in this setting. For convex losses, CLASP achieves regret $O\left(T^{\max\{β,1-β\}}\right)$ and cumulative squared penalty $O\left(T^{1-β}\right)$ for any $β\in (0,1)$. Most importantly, for strongly convex problems, CLASP provides the first logarithmic guarantees on both regret and cumulative squared penalty. In the strongly convex case, the regret is upper bounded by $O( \log T )$ and the cumulative squared penalty is also upper bounded by $O( \log T )$.

*Annemarie Jutte,Uraz Odyurt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using Explainable AI (XAI) and SHAP values, the paper analyzes ML models in industrial CPS to identify training gaps, leading to improved predictive performance by adjusting data window sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial CPS reliability is crucial, and ML models' opaque operations necessitate rigorous evaluation to prevent unexpected behaviors. XAI helps uncover model reasoning for better analysis.

Method: The study applies XAI, specifically SHAP values, to analyze time-series data decomposition's impact on ML model predictions, revealing insufficient contextual information during training.

Result: Adjusting the data window size based on XAI findings improved the model's predictive performance.

Conclusion: XAI methods like SHAP can effectively identify and address gaps in ML model training for industrial CPS, enhancing reliability and performance.

Abstract: Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are sensitive infrastructure from both safety and economics perspectives, making their reliability critically important. Machine Learning (ML), specifically deep learning, is increasingly integrated in industrial CPS, but the inherent complexity of ML models results in non-transparent operation. Rigorous evaluation is needed to prevent models from exhibiting unexpected behaviour on future, unseen data. Explainable AI (XAI) can be used to uncover model reasoning, allowing a more extensive analysis of behaviour. We apply XAI to to improve predictive performance of ML models intended for industrial CPS. We analyse the effects of components from time-series data decomposition on model predictions using SHAP values. Through this method, we observe evidence on the lack of sufficient contextual information during model training. By increasing the window size of data instances, informed by the XAI findings, we are able to improve model performance.

*Matthew Shorvon,Frederik Mallmann-Trenn,David S. Watson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAC algorithms for MAP inference, providing provably optimal solutions under computational budgets, with efficient implementation using probabilistic circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAP estimation is fundamental but often intractable; the paper aims to address this by developing PAC algorithms for provable solutions.

Method: Introduces PAC-MAP algorithms using information-theoretic measures and implements them via probabilistic circuits with randomization strategies.

Result: The approach provides tractable, provably optimal MAP solutions and improves heuristic methods with guarantees, supported by experimental validation.

Conclusion: PAC-MAP offers a rigorous and efficient solution to MAP inference, with practical benefits demonstrated across benchmarks.

Abstract: Computing the conditional mode of a distribution, better known as the $\mathit{maximum\ a\ posteriori}$ (MAP) assignment, is a fundamental task in probabilistic inference. However, MAP estimation is generally intractable, and remains hard even under many common structural constraints and approximation schemes. We introduce $\mathit{probably\ approximately\ correct}$ (PAC) algorithms for MAP inference that provide provably optimal solutions under variable and fixed computational budgets. We characterize tractability conditions for PAC-MAP using information theoretic measures that can be estimated from finite samples. Our PAC-MAP solvers are efficiently implemented using probabilistic circuits with appropriate architectures. The randomization strategies we develop can be used either as standalone MAP inference techniques or to improve on popular heuristics, fortifying their solutions with rigorous guarantees. Experiments confirm the benefits of our method in a range of benchmarks.

TL;DR: This study benchmarks five deep learning models for Raman spectroscopy against three open-source datasets, ensuring fair evaluation under standardized training protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of direct comparisons between Raman-specific deep learning models prompted this systematic benchmark to evaluate their performance fairly.

Method: Five deep learning architectures were assessed using unified training and hyperparameter tuning across three open-source Raman datasets, covering standard evaluation, fine-tuning, and distribution-shift testing.

Result: Classification accuracies and macro-averaged F1 scores were reported to ensure reproducible and fair comparisons.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating deep learning models in Raman spectroscopy, promoting transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Deep learning classifiers for Raman spectroscopy are increasingly reported to outperform classical chemometric approaches. However their evaluations are often conducted in isolation or compared against traditional machine learning methods or trivially adapted vision-based architectures that were not originally proposed for Raman spectroscopy. As a result, direct comparisons between existing deep learning models developed specifically for Raman spectral analysis on shared open-source datasets remain scarce. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents one of the first systematic benchmarks comparing three or more published Raman-specific deep learning classifiers across multiple open-source Raman datasets. We evaluate five representative deep learning architectures under a unified training and hyperparameter tuning protocol across three open-source Raman datasets selected to support standard evaluation, fine-tuning, and explicit distribution-shift testing. We report classification accuracies and macro-averaged F1 scores to provide a fair and reproducible comparison of deep learning models for Raman spectra based classification.

### [207] [On the Intrinsic Dimensions of Data in Kernel Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16139)
*Rustem Takhanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores two intrinsic dimensions ($d_\rho$ and $d_K$) in Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), linking them to generalization performance. It shows worst-case eigenvalue decay is characterized by Kolmogorov $n$-widths and provides error bounds. An algorithm estimates $n$-widths from finite samples, with sample complexity bounds. Effective dimension $d_K$ is computed for fractal sets, often smaller than $d_\rho$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization in KRR by understanding intrinsic dimensionality, analyzing eigenvalue decay, and providing practical tools for estimation.

Method: Investigates Minkowski dimension ($d_\rho$) and effective dimension ($d_K$). Analyzes Kolmogorov $n$-widths, eigenvalue decay, and proposes an algorithm for estimating $n$-widths from samples.

Result: Shows $O(n^{-\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + \epsilon})$ excess error bound, sample complexity $O(\epsilon^{-d_\rho}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ for uniform-like distributions, and $d_K$ can be smaller than $d_\rho$.

Conclusion: Effective dimension $d_K$ enhances generalization bounds in KRR, especially for irregular domains, with practical estimation methods.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that the generalization performance of machine learning methods improves significantly when the intrinsic dimension of the input distribution's support is low. In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_ρ$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kernel function $K$ on a domain $Ω$. The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $Ω$. Given a probability measure $μ$ on $Ω$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $φ\to \int_ΩK(\cdot,x)φ(x)dμ(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $Ω$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $μ$ supported on $Ω$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + ε})$ for any $ε> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $μ$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $ε$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\left(ε^{-d_ρ}\log\frac{1}ε\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$. Finally, we compute the effective dimension $d_K$ for various fractal sets and present additional numerical experiments. Our results show that, for kernels such as the Laplace kernel, the effective dimension $d_K$ can be significantly smaller than the Minkowski dimension $d_ρ$, even though $d_K = d_ρ$ provably holds on regular domains.

*Muhammad Ilham Rizqyawan,Peter Macfarlane,Stathis Hadjidemetriou,Fani Deligianni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beat-SSL is a contrastive learning framework designed for ECG data, addressing limitations of existing methods by using dual-context learning and soft targets. It shows strong performance in multilabel classification and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labelled ECG data is scarce for supervised models, and current contrastive learning methods either lack ECG-specific focus or fail to handle feature similarity continuity.

Method: Beat-SSL employs dual-context learning (rhythm-level and heartbeat-level contrasting) with soft targets for pretraining.

Result: Beat-SSL achieves 93% of an ECG foundation model's performance in multilabel classification and outperforms other methods by 4% in segmentation.

Conclusion: Beat-SSL effectively leverages ECG-specific characteristics and soft targets, demonstrating superior performance in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Obtaining labelled ECG data for developing supervised models is challenging. Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising pretraining approach that enables effective transfer learning with limited labelled data. However, existing CL frameworks either focus solely on global context or fail to exploit ECG-specific characteristics. Furthermore, these methods rely on hard contrastive targets, which may not adequately capture the continuous nature of feature similarity in ECG signals. In this paper, we propose Beat-SSL, a contrastive learning framework that performs dual-context learning through both rhythm-level and heartbeat-level contrasting with soft targets. We evaluated our pretrained model on two downstream tasks: 1) multilabel classification for global rhythm assessment, and 2) ECG segmentation to assess its capacity to learn representations across both contexts. We conducted an ablation study and compared the best configuration with three other methods, including one ECG foundation model. Despite the foundation model's broader pretraining, Beat-SSL reached 93% of its performance in multilabel classification task and surpassed all other methods in the segmentation task by 4%.

TL;DR: TTT-Discover uses reinforcement learning at test time to improve LLM performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple domains with an open model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to advance AI's capability to discover optimal solutions for specific scientific problems by leveraging test-time training, rather than relying on generalization or average performance.

Method: The method involves reinforcement learning during test time, focusing on continuous rewards and prioritizing the most promising solutions. It uses an open model (OpenAI gpt-oss-120b) and publicly available code.

Result: TTT-Discover achieved new state-of-the-art results in mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology, with expert-reviewed solutions. These results were reproducible at low cost.

Conclusion: TTT-Discover demonstrates the potential of test-time training for discovering high-quality solutions to specific problems, outperforming prior methods while using open models and maintaining reproducibility.

Abstract: How can we use AI to discover a new state of the art for a scientific problem? Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erdős' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis. Our solutions are reviewed by experts or the organizers. All our results are achieved with an open model, OpenAI gpt-oss-120b, and can be reproduced with our publicly available code, in contrast to previous best results that required closed frontier models. Our test-time training runs are performed using Tinker, an API by Thinking Machines, with a cost of only a few hundred dollars per problem.

TL;DR: Counterfactual training integrates counterfactual explanations into model training to enhance explanatory capacity and adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods generate counterfactual explanations post-hoc, but this work aims to directly train models to produce plausible and actionable counterfactuals inherently.

Method: The proposed counterfactual training regime minimizes divergence between learned representations and desired counterfactual explanations during training.

Result: Empirical and theoretical results show the method produces models with better counterfactual explanations and improved adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: Counterfactual training effectively integrates explanatory goals into model training, yielding inherently explainable and robust models.

Abstract: We propose a novel training regime termed counterfactual training that leverages counterfactual explanations to increase the explanatory capacity of models. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed method facilitates training models that deliver inherently desirable counterfactual explanations and additionally exhibit improved adversarial robustness.

### [211] [Delayed Assignments in Online Non-Centroid Clustering with Stochastic Arrivals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16091)
*Saar Cohen*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online non-centroid clustering framework allowing delayed assignments to minimize distance and delay costs, proposing a constant-competitive algorithm for stochastic arrivals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional online clustering requires immediate decisions, which is restrictive. Allowing delayed assignments with costs aims to balance clustering quality and decision flexibility.

Method: The paper adopts a stochastic arrival model where points come from an unknown distribution. It devises an algorithm to handle delayed assignments while minimizing combined distance and delay costs.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio, meaning its expected cost is bounded relative to an optimal offline solution as points grow.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates feasibility of constant competitiveness in online clustering with delays under stochastic arrivals, surpassing worst-case limitations.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental problem, aiming to partition a set of elements, like agents or data points, into clusters such that elements in the same cluster are closer to each other than to those in other clusters. In this paper, we present a new framework for studying online non-centroid clustering with delays, where elements, that arrive one at a time as points in a finite metric space, should be assigned to clusters, but assignments need not be immediate. Specifically, upon arrival, each point's location is revealed, and an online algorithm has to irrevocably assign it to an existing cluster or create a new one containing, at this moment, only this point. However, we allow decisions to be postponed at a delay cost, instead of following the more common assumption of immediate decisions upon arrival. This poses a critical challenge: the goal is to minimize both the total distance costs between points in each cluster and the overall delay costs incurred by postponing assignments. In the classic worst-case arrival model, where points arrive in an arbitrary order, no algorithm has a competitive ratio better than sublogarithmic in the number of points. To overcome this strong impossibility, we focus on a stochastic arrival model, where points' locations are drawn independently across time from an unknown and fixed probability distribution over the finite metric space. We offer hope for beyond worst-case adversaries: we devise an algorithm that is constant competitive in the sense that, as the number of points grows, the ratio between the expected overall costs of the output clustering and an optimal offline clustering is bounded by a constant.

### [212] [Average Unfairness in Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16187)
*Pan-Yang Su,Arwa Alanqary,Bryce L. Ferguson,Manxi Wu,Alexandre M. Bayen,Shankar Sastry*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces average unfairness as a new fairness measure in routing games, compares it with existing measures, and analyzes its impact on fairness-efficiency tradeoffs, particularly in constrained system optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to complement existing fairness notions in routing games and provide a theoretical foundation for evaluating fairness-efficiency tradeoffs.

Method: The authors define average unfairness, compare it with loaded and UE unfairness, analyze worst-case values, and study the constrained system optimum problem with unfairness constraints.

Result: Average unfairness is always ≤ loaded unfairness, with equality only under fully fair flow. Optimal flows under average unfairness constraints achieve lower total latency than those under loaded unfairness constraints.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis offers insights into fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in routing games, with implications for network routing optimization.

Abstract: We propose average unfairness as a new measure of fairness in routing games, defined as the ratio between the average latency and the minimum latency experienced by users. This measure is a natural complement to two existing unfairness notions: loaded unfairness, which compares maximum and minimum latencies of routes with positive flow, and user equilibrium (UE) unfairness, which compares maximum latency with the latency of a Nash equilibrium. We show that the worst-case values of all three unfairness measures coincide and are characterized by a steepness parameter intrinsic to the latency function class. We show that average unfairness is always no greater than loaded unfairness, and the two measures are equal only when the flow is fully fair. Besides that, we offer a complete comparison of the three unfairness measures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first theoretical analysis in this direction. Finally, we study the constrained system optimum (CSO) problem, where one seeks to minimize total latency subject to an upper bound on unfairness. We prove that, for the same tolerance level, the optimal flow under an average unfairness constraint achieves lower total latency than any flow satisfying a loaded unfairness constraint. We show that such improvement is always strict in parallel-link networks and establish sufficient conditions for general networks. We further illustrate the latter with numerical examples. Our results provide theoretical guarantees and valuable insights for evaluating fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in network routing.
