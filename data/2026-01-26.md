### [1] [GR3EN: Generative Relighting for 3D Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16272)
*Xiaoyan Xing,Philipp Henzler,Junhwa Hur,Runze Li,Jonathan T. Barron,Pratul P. Srinivasan,Dor Verbin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for 3D relighting of large room-scale scenes by distilling a video-to-video diffusion model, avoiding complex inverse rendering problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D relighting methods struggle with under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering, limiting quality in complex scenes.

Method: Distills outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction.

Result: Enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bypasses inverse rendering challenges, offering flexible relighting for complex scenes.

Abstract: We present a method for relighting 3D reconstructions of large room-scale environments. Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that it can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.

*Dohun Lee,Chun-Hao Paul Huang,Xuelin Chen,Jong Chul Ye,Duygu Ceylan,Hyeonho Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memory-V2V enhances video-to-video diffusion models with explicit memory for cross-consistency in multi-turn editing, achieving faster processing and better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editors lack cross-consistency in multi-turn editing, so Memory-V2V introduces a memory-augmented framework to address this.

Method: Memory-V2V uses retrieval, dynamic tokenization, and a learnable token compressor to condition edits on prior results, reducing redundancy by 30%.

Result: Memory-V2V significantly improves cross-consistency and task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Memory-V2V is a simple yet effective solution for multi-turn video editing, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Recent foundational video-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive results in editing user provided videos by modifying appearance, motion, or camera movement. However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Abhijeet Parida,Antonia Alomar,Zhifan Jiang,Pooneh Roshanitabrizi,Austin Tapp,Ziyue Xu,Syed Muhammad Anwar,Maria J. Ledesma-Carbayo,Holger R. Roth,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeTTL improves federated learning for medical imaging by aligning data distributions across institutions, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation in federated learning due to data heterogeneity and domain shifts in medical imaging.

Method: FeTTL: Federated Template and Task Learning, which learns a global template and task model to harmonize data distributions.

Result: FeTTL outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) in retinal fundus segmentation and metastasis classification.

Conclusion: FeTTL provides a robust solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, enhancing model deployment in multi-institutional medical settings.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across geographically distributed medical centers while preserving data privacy. However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task. These findings suggest that FeTTL offers a principled and extensible solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, supporting robust model deployment in real-world, multi-institutional environments.

### [4] [Where is the multimodal goal post? On the Ability of Foundation Models to Recognize Contextually Important Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16333)
*Aditya K Surikuchi,Raquel Fernández,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores foundation models' ability to identify important sub-events in football videos, revealing their limitations and suggesting modular architectures for better multimodal synergy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve models' capability in distinguishing important sub-events in football games, leveraging existing highlight reels for dataset creation.

Method: Constructed a new dataset using football highlight reels and evaluated state-of-the-art multimodal models on their performance in identifying key sub-events.

Result: Current models perform close to chance level, often relying on one dominant modality and failing to synthesize multimodal information effectively.

Conclusion: Modular architectures and complementary training procedures are needed to handle multimodal heterogeneity and enhance cross-modal synergy.

Abstract: Foundation models are used for many real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events. In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy.

### [5] [Coarse-to-Fine Non-rigid Multi-modal Image Registration for Historical Panel Paintings based on Crack Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16348)
*Aline Sindel,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method for aligning images of historical panel paintings, using sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines for improved efficiency and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual alignment of multi-modal images for art technological investigations is laborious and time-consuming. Automated multi-modal image registration can enhance speed and accuracy.

Method: The method employs convolutional neural networks for keypoint detection and description, graph neural networks for descriptor matching, and a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach for mixed-resolution images.

Result: The approach outperforms competing methods in registration accuracy, as demonstrated by a comprehensive ablation study and a large multi-modal dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of multi-modal image registration for historical paintings, offering superior performance in alignment precision and efficiency.

Abstract: Art technological investigations of historical panel paintings rely on acquiring multi-modal image data, including visual light photography, infrared reflectography, ultraviolet fluorescence photography, x-radiography, and macro photography. For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods.

### [6] [Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378)
*Bridget Leonard,Scott O. Murray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'perspective tokens' to improve spatial reasoning in MLMs, showing enhanced performance on perspective-taking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLMs struggle with allocentric reasoning, exhibiting egocentric bias. The study aims to address this by incorporating human-inspired spatial cognition mechanisms.

Method: Specialized embeddings ('perspective tokens') encode orientation via body-keypoint cues or abstract mental rotation. These are integrated into LLaVA-1.5-13B for evaluation.

Result: Perspective tokens improve accuracy on spatial tasks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human agents. Fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity.

Conclusion: Embedding spatial structure into token space offers a lightweight, model-agnostic solution for improving perspective-taking and allocentric reasoning in MLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.

### [7] [VTFusion: A Vision-Text Multimodal Fusion Network for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16381)
*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Cao,Yuqi Cheng,Yiheng Zhang,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTFusion is a vision-text multimodal fusion framework for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD), addressing domain-specific gaps and cross-modal misalignment with adaptive feature extractors and a robust fusion module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSAD methods neglect domain-specific semantics and suffer from superficial cross-modal fusion, leading to compromised robustness against industrial inspection challenges.

Method: VTFusion introduces adaptive feature extractors for domain-specific learning and generates synthetic anomalies. It also includes a fusion module for cross-modal interaction and a segmentation network for pixel-level anomaly mapping.

Result: Achieves 96.8% and 86.2% AUROCs on MVTec AD and VisA datasets (2-shot) and 93.5% AUPRO on a real-world industrial dataset.

Conclusion: VTFusion advances FSAD by effectively addressing domain gaps and cross-modal misalignment, proving practical for industrial applications.

Abstract: Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD) has emerged as a critical paradigm for identifying irregularities using scarce normal references. While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability. Second, a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module is developed, comprising a fusion block that facilitates rich cross-modal information exchange and a segmentation network that generates refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance. VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance, achieving image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in the 2-shot scenario on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. Furthermore, VTFusion achieves an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world dataset of industrial automotive plastic parts introduced in this paper, further demonstrating its practical applicability in demanding industrial scenarios.

### [8] [ResAgent: Entropy-based Prior Point Discovery and Visual Reasoning for Referring Expression Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16394)
*Yihao Wang,Jusheng Zhang,Ziyi Tang,Keze Wang,Meng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: \model improves RES by addressing limitations of MLLM-based methods with entropy-based point discovery and vision-based reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RES methods suffer from coarse bounding boxes and unreliable textual coordinate reasoning, limiting accuracy.

Method: Proposes \model with Entropy-Based Point Discovery (EBD) for high-information points and Vision-Based Reasoning (VBR) for robust validation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, ReasonSeg).

Conclusion: \model effectively generates accurate segmentation masks with minimal prompts by integrating EBD and VBR.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) is a core vision-language segmentation task that enables pixel-level understanding of targets via free-form linguistic expressions, supporting critical applications such as human-robot interaction and augmented reality. Despite the progress of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches, existing RES methods still suffer from two key limitations: first, the coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant or non-discriminative point prompts; second, the prevalent reliance on textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable, as it fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{\model}, a novel RES framework integrating \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{B}ased Point \textbf{D}iscovery (\textbf{EBD}) and \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{R}easoning (\textbf{VBR}). Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation. Built on these components, \model implements a coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization, entropy-guided point discovery, vision-based validation, and mask decoding. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReasonSeg) demonstrate that \model achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all four benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in generating accurate and semantically grounded segmentation masks with minimal prompts.

### [9] [A Cosine Network for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16413)
*Chunwei Tian,Chengyuan Zhang,Bob Zhang,Zhiwu Li,C. L. Philip Chen,David Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CSRNet, a deep convolutional neural network for image super-resolution, featuring odd-even blocks and cosine annealing for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance structural information preservation in image super-resolution by addressing drawbacks of homologous information and optimizing training.

Method: Designs odd-even heterogeneous blocks and uses cosine annealing for training optimization with warm restarts.

Result: CSRNet competes with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution.

Conclusion: CSRNet effectively improves image super-resolution by leveraging structural information and optimized training strategies.

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks can use hierarchical information to progressively extract structural information to recover high-quality images. However, preserving the effectiveness of the obtained structural information is important in image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution.

*Shuying Li,Qiang Ma,San Zhang,Chuang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DCCS-Det, a novel infrared small target detector combining Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) and Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) modules to improve target detection by addressing local-global feature modeling and feature degradation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving infrared small target detection accuracy by overcoming challenges in joint local-global feature modeling and feature degradation.

Method: DCCS-Det integrates DSE for localized perception and direction-aware context aggregation, and LaSEA for cross-scale feature extraction and noise suppression.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency, validated by extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: DCCS-Det effectively enhances target perception and feature representation in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for applications like remote sensing and surveillance, which aims to identify small, low-contrast targets against complex backgrounds. However, existing methods often struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) or feature redundancy and semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality). To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise. Extensive experiments show that DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation under complex scenarios. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/InfraredSmallTargetDetection-IRSTD.DCCS}{DCCS-Det Official Code is Available Here!}

*Jongmin Yu,Hyeontaek Oh,Zhongtian Sun,Angelica I Aviles-Rivero,Moongu Jeon,Jinhong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlphaFace improves face-swapping robustness for extreme poses using vision-language models and contrastive losses without sacrificing real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods degrade quality with extreme facial poses or are impractical for real-time use.

Method: AlphaFace uses CLIP embeddings and contrastive losses for better identity representation and attribute preservation.

Result: AlphaFace outperforms state-of-the-art methods on pose-challenging datasets (FF++, MPIE, LPFF).

Conclusion: AlphaFace offers robust, real-time face-swapping with enhanced identity and attribute accuracy.

Abstract: Existing face-swapping methods often deliver competitive results in constrained settings but exhibit substantial quality degradation when handling extreme facial poses. To improve facial pose robustness, explicit geometric features are applied, but this approach remains problematic since it introduces additional dependencies and increases computational cost. Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable results; however, they are impractical for real-time processing. We introduce AlphaFace, which leverages an open-source vision-language model and CLIP image and text embeddings to apply novel visual and textual semantic contrastive losses. AlphaFace enables stronger identity representation and more precise attribute preservation, all while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive experiments across FF++, MPIE, and LPFF demonstrate that AlphaFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pose-challenging cases. The project is publicly available on `https://github.com/andrewyu90/Alphaface_Official.git'.

### [12] [MDAFNet: Multiscale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16434)
*Shuying Li,Qiang Ma,San Zhang,Wuwei Wang,Chuang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDAFNet, a novel network for IRSTD, addresses edge degradation and frequency interference issues using MSDE and DAFE modules, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRSTD methods suffer from edge pixel degradation and frequency component confusion, leading to poor detection accuracy.

Method: Proposes MDAFNet with MSDE for edge preservation and DAFE for adaptive frequency enhancement and noise suppression.

Result: MDAFNet shows superior detection performance across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: MDAFNet effectively enhances target detection by addressing edge and frequency challenges.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a crucial role in numerous military and civilian applications. However, existing methods often face the gradual degradation of target edge pixels as the number of network layers increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate between frequency components during feature extraction, leading to low-frequency backgrounds interfering with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise triggering false detections. To address these limitations, we propose MDAFNet (Multi-scale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection), which integrates the Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module and Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSDE module, through a multi-scale edge extraction and enhancement mechanism, effectively compensates for the cumulative loss of target edge information during downsampling. The DAFE module combines frequency domain processing mechanisms with simulated frequency decomposition and fusion mechanisms in the spatial domain to effectively improve the network's capability to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets and selectively suppress high-frequency noise. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior detection performance of MDAFNet.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into backbone networks' performance in face recognition with and without masks, offering deployment recommendations.

Abstract: Erratum to the paper (Zhang et al., 2025): corrections to Table IV and the data in Page 3, Section A. In the post-pandemic era, a high proportion of civil aviation passengers wear masks during security checks, posing significant challenges to traditional face recognition models. The backbone network serves as the core component of face recognition models. In standard tests, r100 series models excelled (98%+ accuracy at 0.01% FAR in face comparison, high top1/top5 in search). r50 ranked second, r34_mask_v1 lagged. In masked tests, r100_mask_v2 led (90.07% accuracy), r50_mask_v3 performed best among r50 but trailed r100. Vit-Small/Tiny showed strong masked performance with gains in effectiveness. Through extensive comparative experiments, this paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of several core backbone networks, aiming to reveal the impacts of different models on face recognition with and without masks, and provide specific deployment recommendations.

### [14] [Emotion-LLaMAv2 and MMEVerse: A New Framework and Benchmark for Multimodal Emotion Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16449)
*Xiaojiang Peng,Jingyi Chen,Zebang Cheng,Bao Peng,Fengyi Wu,Yifei Dong,Shuyuan Tu,Qiyu Hu,Huiting Huang,Yuxiang Lin,Jun-Yan He,Kai Wang,Zheng Lian,Zhi-Qi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Emotion-LLaMAv2 and MMEVerse benchmark to advance emotion recognition and reasoning, addressing limitations of previous methods like reliance on face detection, poor fusion strategies, and limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve emotion reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by overcoming data scarcity, lack of benchmarks, and technical limitations.

Method: Emotion-LLaMAv2 uses an end-to-end multiview encoder, Conv Attention pre-fusion module, and perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning. MMEVerse standardizes evaluation with aggregated, re-annotated datasets.

Result: Developed a robust framework with 130k training and 36k testing clips across 18 benchmarks, enhancing emotion recognition and reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed advancements significantly improve multimodal emotion understanding, offering a standardized and scalable solution.

Abstract: Understanding human emotions from multimodal signals poses a significant challenge in affective computing and human-robot interaction. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format. The data are re-annotated via a multi-agent pipeline involving Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, and GPT 4o, producing 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks.

*Peixian Liang,Songhao Li,Shunsuke Koga,Yutong Li,Zahra Alipour,Yucheng Tang,Daguang Xu,Zhi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA-PATH is an interactive, class-aware foundation model for pathology image segmentation, integrating visual context, semantic descriptions, and expert feedback for precise multi-class segmentation. It outperforms existing models and supports human-in-the-loop refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current segmentation foundation models, which treat segmentation as static and poorly align with pathology needs, by developing an interactive, clinically meaningful model.

Method: VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided prompts. It uses a large-scale dataset (VISTA-PATH Data) with 1.6M image-mask-text triplets across 9 organs and 93 tissue classes.

Result: VISTA-PATH outperforms existing models on benchmarks and enables dynamic refinement via expert feedback. It improves tissue analysis through the Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), showing strong associations with patient survival.

Conclusion: VISTA-PATH transforms pathology segmentation into an interactive, clinically grounded task, enhancing digital pathology analysis.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation for histopathology image is crucial for quantitative tissue analysis and downstream clinical modeling. Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhysGame and GameBench, leveraging gameplay glitches for scalable physical reasoning supervision, improving AI models' real-world and general transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models lack human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets are costly or unrealistic. Gameplay glitches offer a scalable alternative.

Method: Proposes PhysGame, a dataset with 140K glitch-centric QA pairs guided by gameplay metadata, and GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark for evaluation.

Result: PhysGame improves Qwen2.5VL's real-world reasoning by 2.5%, general reasoning by 1.9%, and achieves a 3.7% gain on GameBench.

Conclusion: Learning from gameplay anomalies is scalable and effective for advancing multimodal physical reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world, including object dynamics, material properties, and causal interactions, remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence. Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities. These results indicate that learning from gameplay anomalies offers a scalable and effective pathway toward advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of multi-view consistent 3D wound segmentation from 2D images to improve wound care efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Using a NeRF SDF-based approach (WoundNeRF) to generate 3D wound segmentations from automatically annotated 2D images.

Result: WoundNeRF outperforms Vision Transformer networks and rasterisation-based algorithms in accuracy.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for advancing wound segmentation, with code released for further development.

Abstract: Wound care is often challenged by the economic and logistical burdens that consistently afflict patients and hospitals worldwide. In recent decades, healthcare professionals have sought support from computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In particular, wound segmentation has gained interest due to its ability to provide professionals with fast, automatic tissue assessment from standard RGB images. Some approaches have extended segmentation to 3D, enabling more complete and precise healing progress tracking. However, inferring multi-view consistent 3D structures from 2D images remains a challenge. In this paper, we evaluate WoundNeRF, a NeRF SDF-based method for estimating robust wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations. We demonstrate the potential of this paradigm in recovering accurate segmentations by comparing it against state-of-the-art Vision Transformer networks and conventional rasterisation-based algorithms. The code will be released to facilitate further development in this promising paradigm.

### [18] [Expert Knowledge-Guided Decision Calibration for Accurate Fine-Grained Tree Species Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16498)
*Chen Long,Dian Chen,Ruifei Ding,Zhe Chen,Zhen Dong,Bisheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes EKDC-Net, a method inspired by human expert knowledge-seeking behavior, to improve fine-grained tree species classification by addressing long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity. It introduces a dataset (CU-Tree102) and achieves SOTA performance with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained tree species classification is vital for forest inventory but suffers from long-tailed data distributions and high inter-class similarity. Existing methods lack mechanisms to address these challenges.

Method: The authors introduce EKDC-Net, which includes LPKEM for expert knowledge extraction (using CAM) and UDCM for decision calibration (based on uncertainty).

Result: EKDC-Net boosts backbone accuracy by 6.42% and precision by 11.46% with only 0.08M extra parameters. A new dataset, CU-Tree102, is also presented.

Conclusion: EKDC-Net effectively integrates expert knowledge to enhance classification performance, demonstrating its value as a lightweight, plug-and-play solution for challenging tree species classification tasks.

Abstract: Accurate fine-grained tree species classification is critical for forest inventory and biodiversity monitoring. Existing methods predominantly focus on designing complex architectures to fit local data distributions. However, they often overlook the long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity inherent in limited data, thereby struggling to distinguish between few-shot or confusing categories. In the process of knowledge dissemination in the human world, individuals will actively seek expert assistance to transcend the limitations of local thinking. Inspired by this, we introduce an external "Domain Expert" and propose an Expert Knowledge-Guided Classification Decision Calibration Network (EKDC-Net) to overcome these challenges. Our framework addresses two core issues: expert knowledge extraction and utilization. Specifically, we first develop a Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM). By leveraging Class Activation Map (CAM) analysis, LPKEM guides the domain expert to focus exclusively on discriminative features essential for classification. Subsequently, to effectively integrate this knowledge, we design an Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM). This module dynamically corrects the local model's decisions by considering both overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, we present a large-scale classification dataset covering 102 tree species, named CU-Tree102 to address the issue of scarce diversity in current benchmarks. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Crucially, as a lightweight plug-and-play module, EKDC-Net improves backbone accuracy by 6.42% and precision by 11.46% using only 0.08M additional learnable parameters. The dataset, code, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/TreeCLS.

*Tongcheng Fang,Hanling Zhang,Ruiqi Xie,Zhuo Han,Xin Tao,Tianchen Zhao,Pengfei Wan,Wenbo Ding,Wanli Ouyang,Xuefei Ning,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD improves video generation efficiency by combining sparse and linear attention with a gating mechanism, achieving high sparsity and speedup without sacrificing quality or requiring extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational latency of full attention in Diffusion Transformers for video generation motivates the need for efficient attention mechanisms. Existing sparse attention methods either offer limited acceleration or require significant training resources.

Method: SALAD introduces a lightweight linear attention branch alongside sparse attention and uses an input-dependent gating mechanism to balance them. This achieves high sparsity and speedup efficiently.

Result: SALAD attains 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup while maintaining generation quality comparable to full attention. It requires only minimal training resources (2,000 samples, 1,600 steps, batch size 8).

Conclusion: SALAD effectively addresses the computational challenges of video generation with Diffusion Transformers, offering a practical solution with balanced performance and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in video generation. However, the long input sequences result in high computational latency due to the quadratic complexity of full attention. Various sparse attention mechanisms have been proposed. Training-free sparse attention is constrained by limited sparsity and thus offers modest acceleration, whereas training-based methods can reach much higher sparsity but demand substantial data and computation for training. In this work, we propose SALAD, introducing a lightweight linear attention branch in parallel with the sparse attention. By incorporating an input-dependent gating mechanism to finely balance the two branches, our method attains 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup, while maintaining generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline. Moreover, our finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with a batch size of 8.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TangramPuzzle benchmark evaluates MLLMs' compositional spatial reasoning using Tangram game-inspired tasks, revealing their bias towards silhouette matching over geometric precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored precise compositional spatial reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and fill the gap in current benchmarks.

Method: Introduces TangramPuzzle benchmark with Tangram Construction Expression (TCE) for exact geometric specifications. Includes Outline Prediction and End-to-End Code Generation tasks.

Result: Evaluation shows MLLMs favor silhouette matching over adhering to geometric constraints, causing piece distortions.

Conclusion: TangramPuzzle provides a rigorous evaluation tool, highlighting MLLMs' limitations in precise spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual recognition and semantic understanding. Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnchoredDream is a zero-shot pipeline for generating 360° indoor scenes from a single image, leveraging geometry and appearance consistency to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating complete 360° scenes from a single image is challenging due to issues with appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes.

Method: The pipeline uses an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism, including modules like warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a Grouting Block for seamless transitions.

Result: AnchoredDream significantly outperforms existing methods in appearance consistency and geometric plausibility.

Conclusion: Geometric grounding is key to high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation, as demonstrated by AnchoredDream.

Abstract: Single-view indoor scene generation plays a crucial role in a range of real-world applications. However, generating a complete 360° scene from a single image remains a highly ill-posed and challenging problem. Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360° scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner. Our results highlight the potential of geometric grounding for high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in continuous spatial understanding for MLLMs in dynamic environments and enabling real-world embodied system deployment.

Method: Uses finite spatial memory to avoid computational overload and integrates 3D point clouds with semantic data for better object localization.

Result: Effective performance demonstrated on two datasets using the Fuzzy F1-Score metric.

Conclusion: OnlineSI advances MLLMs' spatial reasoning, supporting real-world embodied applications.

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have increasingly been interested in how to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to possess spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, most existing methods overlook the importance of the ability to continuously work in an ever-changing world, and lack the possibility of deployment on embodied systems in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates. We further integrate 3D point cloud information with semantic information, helping MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene. To evaluate our method, we introduce the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score to mitigate ambiguity, and test our method on two representative datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, paving the way towards real-world embodied systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of classifying previously unseen classes and leverage large-scale, mixed datasets with known and unknown classes.

Method: Introduces a teacher-student framework with subtree pseudo-labels and age-gating to handle unknown data and prevent pseudo-label overconfidence.

Result: Outperforms self-supervised pretraining and matches fully supervised performance with minimal labeled data on iNaturalist19.

Conclusion: The semi-supervised approach effectively improves hierarchical open-set classification using pseudo-labeling.

Abstract: Hierarchical open-set classification handles previously unseen classes by assigning them to the most appropriate high-level category in a class taxonomy. We extend this paradigm to the semi-supervised setting, enabling the use of large-scale, uncurated datasets containing a mixture of known and unknown classes to improve the hierarchical open-set performance. To this end, we propose a teacher-student framework based on pseudo-labeling. Two key components are introduced: 1) subtree pseudo-labels, which provide reliable supervision in the presence of unknown data, and 2) age-gating, a mechanism that mitigates overconfidence in pseudo-labels. Experiments show that our framework outperforms self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised adaptation, and even matches the fully supervised counterpart when using only 20 labeled samples per class on the iNaturalist19 benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/walline/semihoc.

TL;DR: The paper proposes HA2F, a dual-module framework for remote sensing change detection, addressing feature alignment and noise sensitivity issues, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from feature matching deviations and noise sensitivity, limiting their effectiveness in remote sensing change detection.

Method: HA2F combines dynamic hierarchical feature calibration (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement (NAFRM) modules to improve feature alignment and noise robustness.

Result: HA2F outperforms existing methods on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets in precision and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed HA2F framework effectively addresses key challenges in remote sensing change detection, demonstrating superior performance and modular efficacy.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify the spatio-temporal changes of land cover, providing critical support for multi-disciplinary applications (e.g., environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and climate change studies). Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency. In addition, ablation experiments show that DHFCM and NAFRM are effective. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/RemoteSensingChangeDetection-RSCD.HA2F}{HA2F Official Code is Available Here!}

Motivation: Existing CoVR frameworks fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage, yielding marginal improvements. The authors aim to enhance performance by leveraging VLMs and introducing progressive fusion and alignment techniques.

Method: Proposes a CoVR framework with X-Aligner, a cross-attention module for progressive fusion of inputs. Uses captions for richer representation and trains in two stages: first, training X-Aligner; second, fine-tuning the textual encoder. Built on BLIP-family models and trained on Webvid-CoVR.

Result: Achieves Recall@1 of 63.93% on Webvid-CoVR-Test and strong zero-shot performance on CIRCO and Fashion-IQ, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The framework advances CoVR by leveraging VLMs and progressive fusion, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) facilitates video retrieval by combining visual and textual queries. However, existing CoVR frameworks typically fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage, achieving only marginal gains over initial baseline. To address this, we propose a novel CoVR framework that leverages the representational power of Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework incorporates a novel cross-attention module X-Aligner, composed of cross-attention layers that progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align their multimodal representation with that of the target video. To further enhance the representation of the multimodal query, we incorporate the caption of the visual query as an additional input. The framework is trained in two stages to preserve the pretrained VLM representation. In the first stage, only the newly introduced module is trained, while in the second stage, the textual query encoder is also fine-tuned. We implement our framework on top of BLIP-family architecture, namely BLIP and BLIP-2, and train it on the Webvid-CoVR data set. In addition to in-domain evaluation on Webvid-CoVR-Test, we perform zero-shot evaluations on the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) data sets CIRCO and Fashion-IQ. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on CoVR obtaining a Recall@1 of 63.93% on Webvid-CoVR-Test, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on CIR tasks.

Result: Outperforms classical baselines in Accuracy, AUC, and F1-score with ~2-3M parameters and low cost. Improved feature discriminability and stability.

Conclusion: Offers a practical, high-performance solution for medical AI in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Intelligent medical image analysis is essential for clinical decision support but is often limited by scarce annotations, constrained computational resources, and suboptimal model generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight medical image classification framework that integrates self-supervised contrastive learning with quantum-enhanced feature modeling. MobileNetV2 is employed as a compact backbone and pretrained using a SimCLR-style self-supervised paradigm on unlabeled images. A lightweight parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is embedded as a quantum feature enhancement module, forming a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, which is subsequently fine-tuned on limited labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only approximately 2-3 million parameters and low computational cost, the proposed method consistently outperforms classical baselines without self-supervised learning or quantum enhancement in terms of Accuracy, AUC, and F1-score. Feature visualization further indicates improved discriminability and representation stability. Overall, this work provides a practical and forward-looking solution for high-performance medical artificial intelligence under resource-constrained settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in detecting small targets in UAV imagery due to imbalanced scales and blurred edges.

Result: BPIM achieves better performance than Yolov5-P2 on VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets with comparable computation load.

Conclusion: BPIM effectively enhances small object detection in UAV applications by leveraging boundary and position cues.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications have become increasingly prevalent in aerial photography and object recognition. However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion. On the VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, experimental results show the better performances of BPIM compared to the baseline Yolov5-P2, and obtains the promising performance in the state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent diffusion models struggle with preserving edge structures during edits, which is critical for tasks like photorealistic style transfer and tone adjustment.

Method: The authors propose SPL, a training-free approach using local linear models to quantify structural differences, combined with post-processing, masking, and color preservation loss.

Result: Experiments show SPL significantly improves structural fidelity in edited images.

Conclusion: SPL effectively addresses structural preservation challenges in latent-diffusion-based editing, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing leverage latent diffusion models (LDMs) for versatile, text-prompt-driven edits across diverse tasks. Yet, maintaining pixel-level edge structures-crucial for tasks such as photorealistic style transfer or image tone adjustment-remains as a challenge for latent-diffusion-based editing. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) that leverages local linear models to quantify structural differences between input and edited images. Our training-free approach integrates SPL directly into the diffusion model's generative process to ensure structural fidelity. This core mechanism is complemented by a post-processing step to mitigate LDM decoding distortions, a masking strategy for precise edit localization, and a color preservation loss to preserve hues in unedited areas. Experiments confirm SPL enhances structural fidelity, delivering state-of-the-art performance in latent-diffusion-based image editing.

Conclusion: ReWeaver provides high-fidelity garment representations suitable for physical simulation and robotic manipulation, bridging the sim-to-real gap effectively.

Abstract: High-quality 3D garment reconstruction plays a crucial role in mitigating the sim-to-real gap in applications such as digital avatars, virtual try-on and robotic manipulation. However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies. Extensive experiments show that ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of topology accuracy, geometry alignment and seam-panel consistency.

TL;DR: ACLNet improves skeleton-based activity recognition by refining contrastive learning with affinity metrics and dynamic temperature scheduling, outperforming existing methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack exploitation of inter-class structural similarities and neglect anomalous positive samples, prompting the need for ACLNet.

Method: ACLNet introduces affinity metrics for similarity refinement, activity superclasses, dynamic temperature schedules, and margin-based contrastive strategies.

Result: ACLNet demonstrates superior performance on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B datasets.

Conclusion: ACLNet effectively enhances feature discrimination in skeleton-based activity recognition through advanced contrastive learning techniques.

Abstract: In skeleton-based human activity understanding, existing methods often adopt the contrastive learning paradigm to construct a discriminative feature space. However, many of these approaches fail to exploit the structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples. In this study, we introduce ACLNet, an Affinity Contrastive Learning Network that explores the intricate clustering relationships among human activity classes to improve feature discrimination. Specifically, we propose an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements, thereby forming activity superclasses that provide more informative contrastive signals. A dynamic temperature schedule is also introduced to adaptively adjust the penalty strength for various superclasses. In addition, we employ a margin-based contrastive strategy to improve the separation of hard positive and negative samples within classes. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate the superiority of our method in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

### [33] [CER-HV: A CER-Based Human-in-the-Loop Framework for Cleaning Datasets Applied to Arabic-Script HTR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16713)
*Sana Al-azzawi,Elisa Barney,Marcus Liwicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in Arabic-script handwritten text recognition (HTR) by proposing CER-HV, a framework to detect and clean label errors in datasets, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic-script HTR lags behind Latin-script HTR due to data quality issues in existing datasets. The study aims to identify and rectify these issues to enhance recognition accuracy.

Method: The authors introduce CER-HV, combining a CER-based noise detector (using a CRNN with early stopping) and human verification to clean dataset labels.

Result: Their CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, and CER-HV improves CER by 0.3-1.8%, uncovering underreported dataset errors.

Conclusion: CER-HV effectively improves dataset quality and HTR performance for Arabic-script languages, with potential applicability to other scripts.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) for Arabic-script languages still lags behind Latin-script HTR, despite recent advances in model architectures, datasets, and benchmarks. We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.
  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones. Although our experiments focus on documents written in an Arabic-script language, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Ajami, and Pashto, the framework is general and can be applied to other text recognition datasets.

*Yann Le Gall,Nicolas Burlet,Mathieu Simon,Fabien Novella,Samantha Dugelay,Jean-Philippe Malkasse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores shadow retrieval from Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) data to enhance target analysis and 3D reconstruction, using sub-aperture filtering and fixed focus shadow enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSAS offers 360° azimuth views but loses shadow information, which is crucial for target recognition. The paper aims to recover this data to improve analysis and 3D reconstruction.

Method: Sub-aperture filtering generates multiple viewpoints; fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) sharpens shadows. An interactive interface visualizes shadows, and space-carving reconstructs 3D shapes.

Result: The approach successfully retrieves shadow information, enhancing target analysis and enabling 3D reconstruction from CSAS data.

Conclusion: Shadows in CSAS data are valuable for improving target recognition and 3D shape reconstruction, demonstrating practical utility in mine warfare.

Abstract: Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) provides a 360° azimuth view of the seabed, surpassing the limited aperture and mono-view image of conventional side-scan SAS. This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory. A space-carving reconstruction method is applied to infer the 3D shape of the object from the segmented shadows. The results demonstrate the potential of shadows in circular SAS for improving target analysis and 3D reconstruction.

*Renjie Ding,Yaonan Wang,Min Liu,Jialin Zhu,Jiazheng Wang,Jiahao Zhao,Wenting Shen,Feixiang He,Xiang Che*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes overlooked optimization details in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), introduces decoupled techniques, and proposes AdamW-GS for improved efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address under-explored optimization issues in 3DGS, such as update step coupling and gradient coupling, which hinder performance.

Method: Decouples optimization into Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization, and Decoupled Attribute Regularization, then re-couples beneficial components into AdamW-GS.

Result: Empirical analysis shows improved optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness with AdamW-GS.

Conclusion: The proposed AdamW-GS outperforms existing methods by decoupling and re-coupling optimization components.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time novel view synthesis. As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.

*Cuong Le,Pavló Melnyk,Bastian Wandt,Mårten Wadenbäck*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMPose is a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method using flow matching and graph convolutional networks, outperforming diffusion-based methods in speed and accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the ill-posed nature of 3D pose estimation from monocular views by incorporating uncertainty and leveraging probabilistic approaches for more accurate results.

Method: Uses flow matching generative approach with continuous normalizing flows and graph convolutional networks conditioned on 2D cues for feature aggregation.

Result: Demonstrates faster and more accurate 3D pose estimations compared to state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW benchmarks.

Conclusion: FMPose effectively improves 3D human pose estimation by integrating probabilistic modeling and optimal transport, setting new benchmarks in the field.

Abstract: Recovering 3D human poses from a monocular camera view is a highly ill-posed problem due to the depth ambiguity. Earlier studies on 3D human pose lifting from 2D often contain incorrect-yet-overconfident 3D estimations. To mitigate the problem, emerging probabilistic approaches treat the 3D estimations as a distribution, taking into account the uncertainty measurement of the poses. Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. The 2D lifting condition is modeled via graph convolutional networks, leveraging the learnable connections between human body joints as the graph structure for feature aggregation. Compared to diffusion-based methods, the FMPose with optimal transport produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations. Experimental results show major improvements of our FMPose over current state-of-the-art methods on three common benchmarks for 3D human pose estimation, namely Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW.

*Jiahao Li,Yunpeng Bai,Yongkang Dai,Hao Guo,Hongping Gan,Yilei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrepARG introduces a novel method to encode B-rep geometry and topology into holistic token sequences, enabling sequence-based generation with transformer architectures, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based B-rep representations decouple geometric and topological features, limiting the use of sequence-based generative frameworks like transformers, which excel in other domains.

Method: BrepARG encodes B-rep into geometry, position, and face index tokens, constructs hierarchical token sequences, and uses a transformer-based autoregressive model for generation.

Result: Experiments show BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art performance, proving the feasibility of holistic token sequence representation for B-rep.

Conclusion: BrepARG successfully validates the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, paving the way for new B-rep generation approaches.

Abstract: Previous representation and generation approaches for the B-rep relied on graph-based representations that disentangle geometric and topological features through decoupled computational pipelines, thereby precluding the application of sequence-based generative frameworks, such as transformer architectures that have demonstrated remarkable performance. In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BrepARG validates the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation.

*Shuai Huang,Xuhan Lin,Yuwu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP) for few-shot class-incremental learning, leveraging pretrained knowledge and attention mechanisms to improve generalization and reduce forgetting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to adapt models to new classes with very limited samples while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Prompt-based methods show promise but need better transfer and generalization under extreme few-shot settings.

Method: CASP introduces trainable bias parameters into CLS token projections to modulate attention weights. It also uses attention perturbation and Manifold Token Mixup to enhance generalization.

Result: CASP outperforms existing methods on CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets without fine-tuning in incremental phases and reduces parameter overhead.

Conclusion: CASP effectively addresses few-shot class-incremental learning by leveraging pretrained knowledge and attention mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a core challenge in continual learning, requiring models to rapidly adapt to new classes with very limited samples while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead.

TL;DR: A new method for detecting spinal ligament landmarks achieves high accuracy and broad applicability across spinal regions, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate representation of ligament attachments is crucial for realistic biomechanical simulations, but current automated methods are limited in scope or precision.

Method: The approach involves shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae followed by domain-specific rules to identify ligament attachment points.

Result: The method showed high accuracy with a mean absolute error of 0.7 mm and a root mean square error of 1.1 mm on two spinal datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms existing techniques in accuracy and generalization, making it a reliable solution for spine modeling.

Abstract: In biomechanical modeling, the representation of ligament attachments is crucial for a realistic simulation of the forces acting between the vertebrae. These forces are typically modeled as vectors connecting ligament landmarks on adjacent vertebrae, making precise identification of these landmarks a key requirement for constructing reliable spine models. Existing automated detection methods are either limited to specific spinal regions or lack sufficient accuracy. This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by achieving high accuracy and demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions. Validation on two independent spinal datasets from multiple patients yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 mm and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 mm.

TL;DR: A dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework combines visual features and eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of interior spaces, outperforming existing methods and highlighting the role of eye-tracking in enhancing predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding aesthetic experiences in interior spaces is challenging due to subjective perception and complex visual responses. This study aims to improve predictions by integrating visual and gaze data.

Method: The study uses a dual-branch CNN-LSTM model trained on a dataset of 224 interior design videos with synchronized gaze data and ratings from 28 participants across 15 aesthetic dimensions.

Result: The model achieves 72.2% accuracy for objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% for subjective ones (e.g., relaxation), outperforming benchmarks. Eye-tracking data enhances predictions, especially for subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: Incorporating eye-tracking as privileged training information improves practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design, with gaze and visual cues playing distinct roles in objective and subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Understanding how people perceive and evaluate interior spaces is essential for designing environments that promote well-being. However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.

TL;DR: ColorConceptBench evaluates color-concept associations in T2I models, revealing their lack of sensitivity to abstract semantics and resistance to standard improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how T2I models associate colors with implicit concepts, which remains underexplored despite model advancements.

Method: Introduces ColorConceptBench, a human-annotated benchmark with 1,281 implicit color concepts and 6,369 annotations, evaluating seven T2I models via probabilistic color distributions.

Result: Current models show insensitivity to abstract semantics, unaffected by scaling or guidance, indicating limitations beyond model size.

Conclusion: Achieving human-like color semantics necessitates fundamental changes in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced considerably, their capability to associate colors with implicit concepts remains underexplored. To address the gap, we introduce ColorConceptBench, a new human-annotated benchmark to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through the lens of probabilistic color distributions. ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance). This demonstrates that achieving human-like color semantics requires more than larger models, but demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for validation data in checkpoint selection, reducing computational overhead and simplifying deployment.

Method: Use the Frobenius norm of classifier-head gradients from a single forward-backward pass as a proxy for performance, with normalization techniques for stability.

Result: This method closes most of the gap to oracle performance (4.24% +/- 2.00%) and works across CNNs, Transformers, and diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed gradient norm proxy is an efficient, label-free tool for checkpoint selection and monitoring, suitable for diverse models and tasks.

Abstract: We propose a validation-free checkpointing signal from a single forward-backward pass: the Frobenius norm of the classifier-head gradient on one detached-feature batch, ||g||_F = ||dL/dW||_F. Across ImageNet-1k CNNs and Transformers, this proxy is strongly negative with Top-1 and positive with loss. Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor. Validation labels are never used beyond reporting. The probe adds much less than 0.1% of an epoch and works as a drop-in for validation-free checkpoint selection and early stopping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised framework for training Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models using unlabeled data, improving localization in large-scale environments by extending pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VGGT models rely on ground truth labels, limiting their adaptability to unlabeled and unseen scenes. The goal is to enhance localization capability without labeled data.

Method: The framework extends pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. It samples multiple source frames, projects them onto target frames, and uses photometric and geometric consistency as optimization loss.

Result: The model converges quickly and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization, with both attention layers and camera/depth heads effectively capturing multi-view geometry.

Conclusion: The self-supervised approach successfully trains VGGT models without ground truth labels, demonstrating improved performance in large-scale environments.

Abstract: Transformer-based general visual geometry frameworks have shown promising performance in camera pose estimation and 3D scene understanding. Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization. Our code will be released at https://github.com/X-yangfan/GPA-VGGT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems in surgery lack multimodal understanding. VLMs, integrating vision and language, offer potential for comprehensive surgical scene modeling.

Method: Three VLMs (Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, InternVL3.5) are evaluated on the GraSP dataset for surgical tool detection under zero-shot and LoRA fine-tuning settings.

Result: Qwen2.5 outperforms other VLMs and Grounding DINO in detection performance, showing better zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned results.

Conclusion: Qwen2.5 is promising for surgical tool detection, excelling in recognition, while Grounding DINO performs better in localization.

Abstract: Surgery is a highly complex process, and artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in supporting surgical guidance and decision-making. However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.

Result: Successfully generates long videos (up to 12 hours) with minimal quality decay, achieving real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively suppresses sink-collapse while maintaining high generation quality, setting a benchmark for long-form video generation.

Abstract: Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.

### [47] [Reward-Forcing: Autoregressive Video Generation with Reward Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16933)
*Jingran Zhang,Ning Li,Yuanhao Ban,Andrew Bai,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using reward signals instead of teacher models for autoregressive video generation, achieving comparable performance to existing methods with simpler training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior autoregressive video generation models rely heavily on teacher models, which limit performance and output quality. This paper explores an alternative approach using reward signals to improve efficiency and scalability.

Method: The method replaces teacher models with reward signals to guide the autoregressive generation process, simplifying training while maintaining visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Result: Experiments show the method performs comparably to state-of-the-art autoregressive models (84.92 vs. 84.31 on VBench) and sometimes surpasses bidirectional models by avoiding teacher model constraints.

Conclusion: Reward-guided autoregressive generation offers a simpler, efficient alternative to teacher-dependent methods, achieving competitive performance without reliance on strong teacher models.

Abstract: While most prior work in video generation relies on bidirectional architectures, recent efforts have sought to adapt these models into autoregressive variants to support near real-time generation. However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework using a Copy-Paste Mechanism and Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy to handle scarce labels and unknown domain gaps in medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of scarce expert annotations and mixed-domain data in medical image segmentation, where existing methods assume single domain shifts or explicit domain labels.

Method: Combines a Copy-Paste Mechanism for data augmentation and a CMMD block for feature alignment in a teacher-student framework to enhance domain-invariant representations.

Result: Outperforms semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks, achieving robust segmentation with few labeled examples.

Conclusion: Establishes a viable solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation, overcoming domain gaps and label scarcity.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable progress in medical image semantic segmentation, yet its success heavily depends on large-scale expert annotations and consistent data distributions. In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisGym, a suite of 17 environments to evaluate and train Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in multi-step visual tasks, revealing significant limitations in current models and proposing solutions like supervised finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor characterization of VLMs in multi-step visual interactions and understand their limitations in integrating perception, memory, and action over long horizons.

Method: Developed VisGym with diverse environments (symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, manipulation) and evaluated frontier models using multi-step solvers and structured demonstrations.

Result: Frontier models perform poorly in interactive settings (46.6% success in easy, 26.0% in hard setups), struggle with long context, and find text-based tasks harder visually.

Conclusion: Supervised finetuning with explicit goals, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations improves performance, highlighting pathways for enhancing multi-step visual decision-making.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain poorly characterized in multi-step visual interactions, particularly in how they integrate perception, memory, and action over long horizons. We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

*David Serrano-Lozano,Anand Bhattad,Luis Herranz,Jean-François Lalonde,Javier Vazquez-Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncLight is a novel method for consistent, parametric relighting across uncalibrated multi-view scenes, addressing the limitations of existing single-view approaches by enabling high-fidelity lighting control without needing camera poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative relighting methods struggle with maintaining lighting consistency across multiple views, which is crucial for applications like multi-camera broadcasts and virtual production.

Method: SyncLight uses a multi-view diffusion transformer trained with a latent bridge matching formulation and leverages a hybrid dataset of synthetic and real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity relighting of entire image sets in one inference step and generalizes zero-shot to arbitrary viewpoints without camera pose information.

Conclusion: SyncLight provides practical relighting workflows for multi-view systems, overcoming the challenges of lighting consistency in existing approaches.

Abstract: We present SyncLight, the first method to enable consistent, parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene. While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models struggle with multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in dynamic environments, prompting the development of AnyView.

Method: AnyView uses diffusion-based video generation trained on monocular, multi-view static, and multi-view dynamic datasets to synthesize videos from arbitrary viewpoints.

Result: AnyView achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks and excels in extreme dynamic view synthesis, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: AnyView demonstrates robust spatiotemporal consistency and generalizability across diverse real-world scenarios, setting a new benchmark for dynamic view synthesis.

Abstract: Modern generative video models excel at producing convincing, high-quality outputs, but struggle to maintain multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we introduce \textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \emph{any} viewpoint.

TL;DR: GameTalk trains LLMs for strategic multi-agent decision-making via dialogue, outperforming untrained models, especially with DPO fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of optimizing long-term objectives in multi-agent settings through dialogue, beyond single-turn tasks.

Method: Adapts fine-tuning methods (GRPO, DPO, STaR) to incorporate global reward signals across conversations, evaluated on complex games.

Result: GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, with DPO showing the strongest performance gains under reward shaping.

Conclusion: Conversational fine-tuning is promising for enhancing LLMs' reasoning, negotiation, and action in interactive environments.

Abstract: Strategic decision-making in multi-agent settings is a key challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly when coordination and negotiation must unfold over extended conversations. While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce \textbf{GameTalk}, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains. These findings position conversational fine-tuning as a promising path for LLMs to reason, negotiate, and act in interactive environments.

TL;DR: ChiEngMixBench is a new benchmark evaluating code-mixing ability in authentic contexts, focusing on spontaneity and naturalness, revealing structured cognitive alignment between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work treats code-mixing as translation, failing to assess context-appropriate switching. ChiEngMixBench addresses this gap by evaluating alignment with human conventions.

Method: Built using a scalable pipeline, ChiEngMixBench measures spontaneity and naturalness as signals of cognitive alignment in code-mixing.

Result: Metrics distinguish model performance, and an emergent Terminology Layering Strategy aligns with MLF theory, showing structured cognitive alignment.

Conclusion: ChiEngMixBench provides a systematic way to evaluate code-mixing, revealing insights into model-human cognitive alignment.

Abstract: Code-mixing is increasingly prevalent in interactions between humans and large language models, yet existing work often reduces it to a translation or convertibility problem, making it difficult to assess whether a model's switching behavior is context-appropriate and aligned with human conventions. We introduce ChiEngMixBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate code-mixing ability in authentic community contexts, built upon a general construction pipeline that enables scalable dataset development across domains and bilingual pairs. ChiEngMixBench formulates code-mixing as a cognitive alignment problem, characterized by two complementary signals: Spontaneity and Naturalness. Empirical evaluation shows that our metrics can systematically distinguish code-mixing performance across models. Beyond benchmarking, we further uncover an implicitly emergent Terminology Layering Strategy, a phenomenon consistent with the Matrix Language Frame (MLF) theory, indicating structured cognitive alignment between multilingual large language models and human communication.

TL;DR: M3Kang is a multilingual, multimodal math reasoning dataset for VLMs, derived from a global math contest, benchmarking models against human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore VLMs' multilingual math reasoning capabilities compared to humans, as current research lacks focus here.

Method: Introduce M3Kang dataset (1,747 multilingual problems with diagrams), benchmark SOTA models, and compare with student data.

Result: Models struggle with basic math and diagrams; multilingual techniques improve performance.

Conclusion: M3Kang enables direct human-model comparison; open-sourcing dataset and tools fosters further research.

Abstract: Despite state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, their performance in multilingual mathematical reasoning remains underexplored, particularly when compared to human performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce M3Kang, the first massively multilingual, multimodal mathematical reasoning dataset for VLMs. It is derived from the Kangaroo Math Competition, the world's largest mathematics contest, which annually engages over six million participants under the age of 18 across more than 90 countries. M3Kang includes 1,747 unique multiple-choice problems organized by grade-level difficulty, with translations into 108 culturally diverse languages, some of them including diagrams essential for solving them. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive benchmarking on both closed- and open-source SOTA models. We observe that, despite recent advances, models still struggle with basic math and diagram-based reasoning, with performance scaling with language presence and model size, but not with grade level. We also find that multilingual techniques can be effectively extended to the multimodal setting, resulting in significant improvements over baseline approaches. Our analysis also incorporates performance data from over 68,000 students, enabling direct comparison with human performance. We are open-sourcing M3Kang, including the English-only subset M2Kang, along with the framework and codebase used to construct the dataset.

TL;DR: An offline distillation method optimizes LLMs for domain-specific tasks with minimal data (500 lines) and hardware, achieving high accuracy (96.7%) and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific tasks due to hallucinations from lack of training data. The goal is to create efficient, specialized models under hardware constraints.

Method: Uses offline response-based distillation with Unsloth library to optimize Qwen-2.5-7B. Tests three data strategies: general domain adaptation, unstructured injection, and context-aware synthetic data.

Result: The 500-line context-aware dataset outperforms larger datasets, achieving 96.7% accuracy and robust rejection, proving data quality matters more than quantity.

Conclusion: Specialized LLMs can be trained effectively with small, high-quality datasets, supporting the LIMA hypothesis for low-resource domain adaptation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but often struggle with hallucinations when handling domain-specific or institutional knowledge absent from their pre-training. We present an offline response-based knowledge distillation method that develops high-accuracy specialized assistants under constrained hardware resources. We evaluate three distinct data strategies: general domain adaptation (15,000 lines), unstructured knowledge injection (2,000 lines), and a context-aware synthetic dataset (500 lines) generated by a teacher model. To minimize computational costs, we utilize the Unsloth library to optimize the Qwen-2.5-7B student model, reducing NVIDIA A100 GPU memory requirements from 40 GB to 16 GB. Experimental results demonstrate that while larger unstructured datasets suffer from persistent hallucinations, the 500-line context-aware dataset achieves a 96.7% accuracy rate and robust rejection capability. These findings validate the LIMA hypothesis, showing that data quality and structural alignment are more critical than quantity for domain adaptation in low-resource settings.

Motivation: To enhance sampling speed and coherence in language generation compared to autoregressive LLMs.

Method: Introduces Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), adapting continuous diffusion models for discrete state spaces by learning a data-driven forward process.

Result: Reduces likelihood gap with autoregressive models of similar size and matches sample quality of previous latent diffusion models.

Conclusion: NFDM offers an efficient and coherent approach to language generation, bridging gaps with autoregressive models.

NFDM learns a multivariate forward process from the data, ensuring that the forward process and generative trajectory are a good fit for language modeling. Our model substantially reduces the likelihood gap with autoregressive models of the same size, while achieving sample quality comparable to that of previous latent diffusion models.

TL;DR: Smaller models trained on synthetic data from multilingual LLMs outperform the LLMs themselves, especially in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if synthetic data from LLMs can distill their capabilities into smaller models for efficient multilingual performance.

Method: Generated synthetic datasets in 11 languages and 4 tasks using a multilingual LLM, then trained smaller models via fine-tuning, instruction tuning, or synthetic examples.

Result: Small models trained on synthetic data outperform the large LLM, particularly in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: LLMs serve better as data generators (teachers) than classifiers, enabling efficient multilingual models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual capabilities, making them promising tools in both high- and low-resource languages. One particularly valuable use case is generating synthetic samples that can be used to train smaller models in low-resource scenarios where human-labelled data is scarce. In this work, we investigate whether these synthetic data generation capabilities can serve as a form of distillation, producing smaller models that perform on par with or even better than massive LLMs across languages and tasks. To this end, we use a state-of-the-art multilingual LLM to generate synthetic datasets covering 11 languages and 4 classification tasks. These datasets are then used to train smaller models via fine-tuning or instruction tuning, or as synthetic in-context examples for compact LLMs. Our experiments show that even small amounts of synthetic data enable smaller models to outperform the large generator itself, particularly in low-resource languages. Overall, the results suggest that LLMs are best utilised as generators (teachers) rather than classifiers, producing data that empowers smaller and more efficient multilingual models.

Motivation: To provide a comprehensive resource for transnational analyses of wartime discourse and competing narratives across global media.

Method: Created a corpus of 246K news articles from 11 outlets in 5 countries, annotated with metadata and evaluated for downstream tasks like stance detection and sentiment analysis.

Result: Demonstrated polarized interpretations in media coverage, reflecting geopolitical interests and divergent narratives.

Conclusion: DNIPRO is a foundational resource for computational journalism and understanding conflicting narratives in global information ecosystems.

Abstract: We introduce DNIPRO, a novel longitudinal corpus of 246K news articles documenting the Russo-Ukrainian war from Feb 2022 to Aug 2024, spanning eleven media outlets across five nation states (Russia, Ukraine, U.S., U.K., and China) and three languages (English, Russian, and Mandarin Chinese). This multilingual resource features consistent and comprehensive metadata, and multiple types of annotation with rigorous human evaluations for downstream tasks relevant to systematic transnational analyses of contentious wartime discourse. DNIPRO's distinctive value lies in its inclusion of competing geopolitical perspectives, making it uniquely suited for studying narrative divergence, media framing, and information warfare. To demonstrate its utility, we include use case experiments using stance detection, sentiment analysis, topical framing, and contradiction analysis of major conflict events within the larger war. Our explorations reveal how outlets construct competing realities, with coverage exhibiting polarized interpretations that reflect geopolitical interests. Beyond supporting computational journalism research, DNIPRO provides a foundational resource for understanding how conflicting narratives emerge and evolve across global information ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack polymer-specific knowledge and coverage for polymer design tasks, limiting their effectiveness in AI4Science applications.

Method: Introduces PolyBench, a dataset with 125K+ tasks and 13M+ data points, paired with knowledge-augmented reasoning distillation and CoT augmentation.

Result: SLMs (7B-14B parameters) trained on PolyBench outperform similar-sized models and frontier LLMs on polymer design tasks.

Conclusion: PolyBench and its distillation method effectively bridge the polymer knowledge gap in AI models, enabling better performance in polymer design.

Abstract: Research in AI4Science has shown promise in many science applications, including polymer design. However, current LLMs prove ineffective on this problem space because: (i) most models lack polymer-specific knowledge (ii) existing aligned models lack coverage of knowledge and capabilities relevant to polymer design. Addressing this, we introduce PolyBench, a large scale training and test benchmark dataset of more than 125K polymer design related tasks, leveraging a knowledge base of 13M+ data points obtained from experimental and synthetic sources to ensure broad coverage of polymers and their properties. For effective alignment using PolyBench, we introduce a knowledge-augmented reasoning distillation method that augments this dataset with structured CoT. Furthermore, tasks in PolyBench are organized from simple to complex analytical reasoning problems, enabling generalization tests and diagnostic probes across the problem space. Experiments show that small language models (SLMs), of 7B to 14B parameters, trained on PolyBench data outperform similar sized models, and even closed source frontier LLMs on PolyBench test dataset while demonstrating gains on other polymer benchmarks as well.

TL;DR: LLMs enable automated, rubric-driven evaluation of open-ended exam responses, matching human rater performance and offering personalized feedback, as demonstrated in Estonia’s national exams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient, consistent grading of large-scale exams like nation-wide graduation tests, especially in digitally advanced societies transitioning to electronic systems.

Method: Operationalized an official rubric on two Estonian exam essay datasets, comparing LLM and NLP-based scoring with human panel scores, while evaluating bias and risks.

Result: Automated scoring matched human rater performance, fell within human scoring ranges, and provided fine-grained subscores for feedback.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted, human-in-the-loop assessment is viable for high-stakes exams, scalable even in small-language contexts, and aligns with educational standards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable rapid and consistent automated evaluation of open-ended exam responses, including dimensions of content and argumentation that have traditionally required human judgment. This is particularly important in cases where a large amount of exams need to be graded in a limited time frame, such as nation-wide graduation exams in various countries. Here, we examine the applicability of automated scoring on two large datasets of trial exam essays of two full national cohorts from Estonia. We operationalize the official curriculum-based rubric and compare LLM and statistical natural language processing (NLP) based assessments with human panel scores. The results show that automated scoring can achieve performance comparable to that of human raters and tends to fall within the human scoring range. We also evaluate bias, prompt injection risks, and LLMs as essay writers. These findings demonstrate that a principled, rubric-driven, human-in-the-loop scoring pipeline is viable for high-stakes writing assessment, particularly relevant for digitally advanced societies like Estonia, which is about to adapt a fully electronic examination system. Furthermore, the system produces fine-grained subscore profiles that can be used to generate systematic, personalized feedback for instruction and exam preparation. The study provides evidence that LLM-assisted assessment can be implemented at a national scale, even in a small-language context, while maintaining human oversight and compliance with emerging educational and regulatory standards.

Result: GPT-3.5 had the highest bias score (9.5), while Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored lowest (2.5), showing significant bias variation across models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the impact of regional bias on LLM reliability and fairness, advocating for inclusive evaluation frameworks and bias mitigation strategies.

Abstract: This study investigates regional bias in large language models (LLMs), an emerging concern in AI fairness and global representation. We evaluate ten prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.0 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3, Gemma 7B, Mistral 7B, and Vicuna-13B using a dataset of 100 carefully designed prompts that probe forced-choice decisions between regions under contextually neutral scenarios. We introduce FAZE, a prompt-based evaluation framework that measures regional bias on a 10-point scale, where higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to favor specific regions. Experimental results reveal substantial variation in bias levels across models, with GPT-3.5 exhibiting the highest bias score (9.5) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet scoring the lowest (2.5). These findings indicate that regional bias can meaningfully undermine the reliability, fairness, and inclusivity of LLM outputs in real-world, cross-cultural applications. This work contributes to AI fairness research by highlighting the importance of inclusive evaluation frameworks and systematic approaches for identifying and mitigating geographic biases in language models.

*Suhong Moon,Minwoo Kang,Joseph Suh,Mustafa Safdari,John Canny*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how deep binding of base LLMs with rich narrative identities improves simulation fidelity of human behaviors in social dilemmas, outperforming prior weak-binding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better simulate nuanced human actions by incorporating identity and contextual factors, addressing gaps in prior work focused on weak binding of chat models.

Method: Deep binding of base LLMs with extended backstories, using instruction-tuned models for consistency checks, and modeling contextual factors like time, question framing, and participant pools.

Result: Improved fidelity in simulating human behaviors, with LLMs effectively capturing omitted details that impact study replication.

Conclusion: LLMs enhance exploration of human study nuances, offering a tool to replicate and analyze overlooked contextual and identity-based factors.

Abstract: Humans act via a nuanced process that depends both on rational deliberation and also on identity and contextual factors. In this work, we study how large language models (LLMs) can simulate human action in the context of social dilemma games. While prior work has focused on "steering" (weak binding) of chat models to simulate personas, we analyze here how deep binding of base models with extended backstories leads to more faithful replication of identity-based behaviors. Our study has these findings: simulation fidelity vs human studies is improved by conditioning base LMs with rich context of narrative identities and checking consistency using instruction-tuned models. We show that LLMs can also model contextual factors such as time (year that a study was performed), question framing, and participant pool effects. LLMs, therefore, allow us to explore the details that affect human studies but which are often omitted from experiment descriptions, and which hamper accurate replication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAS is a training-free method to improve multilingual performance by modulating neuron activations, achieving 2.3% and 3.4% improvements in classification and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance gaps between dominant and non-dominant languages in multilingual models by targeting shared and language-specific neurons.

Method: Propose Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS), which modulates neuron activations during inference without training.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 2.3% (Accuracy) and 3.4% (F1) on benchmarks while maintaining high-resource language performance.

Conclusion: Targeted activation steering can enhance multilingual capabilities without modifying model weights, leveraging functional divergence.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit strong multilingual capabilities, yet significant performance gaps persist between dominant and non-dominant languages. Prior work attributes this gap to imbalances between shared and language-specific neurons in multilingual representations. We propose Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS), a training-free inference-time intervention that selectively modulates neuron activations. We evaluate CLAS on classification and generation benchmarks, achieving average improvements of 2.3% (Acc.) and 3.4% (F1) respectively, while maintaining high-resource language performance. We discover that effective transfer operates through functional divergence rather than strict alignment; performance gains correlate with increased language cluster separation. Our results demonstrate that targeted activation steering can unlock latent multilingual capacity in existing models without modification to model weights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free framework for source attribution in clinical summarization using decoder attentions, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure transparency in clinical summarization by attributing statements to their sources without retraining or post-hoc methods.

Method: Uses decoder attentions for direct citation of text spans or images, with two multimodal strategies: raw image mode and caption-as-span mode.

Result: Outperforms embedding-based and self-attribution baselines by +15% F1, with caption-based attribution being lightweight yet effective.

Conclusion: Attention-guided attribution enhances interpretability and practicality in clinical summarization systems.

Abstract: Trustworthy clinical summarization requires not only fluent generation but also transparency about where each statement comes from. We propose a training-free framework for generation-time source attribution that leverages decoder attentions to directly cite supporting text spans or images, overcoming the limitations of post-hoc or retraining-based methods. We introduce two strategies for multimodal attribution: a raw image mode, which directly uses image patch attentions, and a caption-as-span mode, which substitutes images with generated captions to enable purely text-based alignment. Evaluations on two representative domains: clinician-patient dialogues (CliConSummation) and radiology reports (MIMIC-CXR), show that our approach consistently outperforms embedding-based and self-attribution baselines, improving both text-level and multimodal attribution accuracy (e.g., +15% F1 over embedding baselines). Caption-based attribution achieves competitive performance with raw-image attention while being more lightweight and practical. These findings highlight attention-guided attribution as a promising step toward interpretable and deployable clinical summarization systems.

*Zongwan Cao,Bingbing Wen,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoA (Clarify-or-Answer) is an agent that decides whether to ask for clarification or answer directly in ambiguous VQA tasks, improving accuracy by 15.3 points over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world VQA often lacks context, leading to incorrect predictions without clarification.

Method: CoA models the decision to ask or answer, generates focused clarification questions, and uses reinforcement learning (GRPO-CR) to optimize question quality.

Result: CoA improves VQA accuracy by an average of +15.3 points across three models and datasets.

Conclusion: Clarification mechanisms like CoA enhance VQA performance in ambiguous contexts.

Abstract: Real-world visual question answering (VQA) is often context-dependent: an image-question pair may be under-specified, such that the correct answer depends on external information that is not observable in the image. In such cases, directly answering can lead to confident but incorrect predictions. We propose CoA(Clarify-or-Answer), an ask-or-answer agent that separately models the decision to ask or answer, and what to ask if needed. CoA first determines whether clarification is necessary; if so, it asks a single focused question and then incorporates the response to produce the final answer. We introduce CONTEXTCLARIFY with a set of ambiguous VQA questions and the contrast set that is non-ambiguous. We further introduce GRPO-CR (Clarification Reasoning), a reinforcement learning approach that optimizes clarification question generation with multiple reward signals encouraging well-formed, focused, non-trivial questions that resolve ambiguity. Across three VLLMs and three datasets, CoA achieves consistent improvements at both the module and system levels, improving end-to-end VQA accuracy by an average of +15.3 points (83%) over prompting-based baselines

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Jacobian Scopes is a suite of gradient-based methods for interpreting LLM predictions by quantifying token-level influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding which prior tokens most influence LLM predictions due to complex architectures.

Method: Proposes Jacobian Scopes, using gradient-based analysis of linearized relations between final hidden state and inputs. Introduces three variants: Semantic, Fisher, and Temperature Scopes.

Result: Uncovers findings like implicit political biases and provides insights into in-context learning and time-series forecasting mechanisms.

Conclusion: Jacobian Scopes offer valuable tools for interpreting LLM predictions and understanding their underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make next-token predictions based on clues present in their context, such as semantic descriptions and in-context examples. Yet, elucidating which prior tokens most strongly influence a given prediction remains challenging due to the proliferation of layers and attention heads in modern architectures. We propose Jacobian Scopes, a suite of gradient-based, token-level causal attribution methods for interpreting LLM predictions. By analyzing the linearized relations of final hidden state with respect to inputs, Jacobian Scopes quantify how input tokens influence a model's prediction. We introduce three variants - Semantic, Fisher, and Temperature Scopes - which respectively target sensitivity of specific logits, the full predictive distribution, and model confidence (inverse temperature). Through case studies spanning instruction understanding, translation and in-context learning (ICL), we uncover interesting findings, such as when Jacobian Scopes point to implicit political biases. We believe that our proposed methods also shed light on recently debated mechanisms underlying in-context time-series forecasting. Our code and interactive demonstrations are publicly available at https://github.com/AntonioLiu97/JacobianScopes.

*Qinglong Cao,Yuntian Chen,Chao Ma,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with domain-specific tasks despite textual domain knowledge injection, highlighting the need for optimization-level integration via reinforcement fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific knowledge through language alone, limiting their effectiveness in specialized domains.

Method: Proposes a reinforcement fine-tuning framework integrating domain knowledge as constraints and rewards, optimizing model behavior.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in remote sensing and medical domains, demonstrating significant improvements.

Conclusion: Optimization-level domain knowledge integration is essential, revealing limitations of textual conditioning in current MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multimodal perception and understanding tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks. Our results highlight the necessity of optimization-level domain knowledge integration and reveal a fundamental limitation of textual domain conditioning in current MLLMs.

### [69] [Exploring the Effects of Alignment on Numerical Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16444)
*Ayako Sato,Hwichan Kim,Zhousi Chen,Masato Mita,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study identifies that alignment in LLMs causes numerical bias in evaluation tasks and tests mitigation strategies, with score range adjustment being the most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs used as evaluators exhibit numerical bias, disproportionately favoring certain scores, which reduces their evaluation performance. This study aims to understand and mitigate this bias.

Method: The study compares outputs from pre- and post-alignment LLMs to test if alignment causes numerical bias. It also explores mitigation strategies like temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment.

Result: Alignment increases numerical bias in LLMs. Among mitigation strategies, score range adjustment is the most effective in reducing bias and improving evaluation performance.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for further research on optimal score range selection and robust strategies to mitigate numerical bias in aligned LLMs.

Abstract: ``LLM-as-a-judge,'' which utilizes large language models (LLMs) as evaluators, has proven effective in many evaluation tasks. However, evaluator LLMs exhibit numerical bias, a phenomenon where certain evaluation scores are generated disproportionately often, leading reduced evaluation performance. This study investigates the cause of this bias. Given that most evaluator LLMs are aligned through instruction tuning and preference tuning, and that prior research suggests alignment reduces output diversity, we hypothesize that numerical bias arises from alignment. To test this, we compare outputs from pre- and post-alignment LLMs, and observe that alignment indeed increases numerical bias. We also explore mitigation strategies for post-alignment LLMs, including temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment. Among these, score range adjustment is most effective in reducing bias and improving performance, though still heuristic. Our findings highlight the need for further work on optimal score range selection and more robust mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoGos, an LLM fine-tuned for Go gameplay, combining expert knowledge with general reasoning to achieve professional-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel in general reasoning tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like Go. This work aims to bridge the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific expertise.

Method: The approach involves mixed fine-tuning with structured Go expertise and Chain-of-Thought reasoning data, followed by reinforcement learning to integrate domain knowledge.

Result: LoGos achieves performance comparable to human professional Go players, surpassing other LLMs.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of enhancing LLMs for specialized tasks and provides resources like a Go dataset and benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding, matching or surpassing human capabilities. However, these impressive reasoning abilities face significant challenges in specialized domains. Taking Go as an example, although AlphaGo has established the high performance ceiling of AI systems in Go, mainstream LLMs still struggle to reach even beginner-level proficiency, let alone perform natural language reasoning. This performance gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain experts is significantly limiting the application of LLMs on a wider range of domain-specific tasks. In this work, we aim to bridge the divide between LLMs' general reasoning capabilities and expert knowledge in domain-specific tasks. We perform mixed fine-tuning with structured Go expertise and general long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data as a cold start, followed by reinforcement learning to integrate expert knowledge in Go with general reasoning capabilities. Through this methodology, we present \textbf{LoGos}, a powerful LLM that not only maintains outstanding general reasoning abilities, but also conducts Go gameplay in natural language, demonstrating effective strategic reasoning and accurate next-move prediction. LoGos achieves performance comparable to human professional players, substantially surpassing all existing LLMs. Through this work, we aim to contribute insights on applying general LLM reasoning capabilities to specialized domains. We will release the first large-scale Go dataset for LLM training, the first LLM Go evaluation benchmark, and the first general LLM that reaches human professional-level performance in Go at: https://github.com/Entarochuan/LoGos.

TL;DR: GraphAnchor introduces a dynamic graph-based knowledge indexing system for RAG to better integrate and interpret scattered evidence, improving LLM performance on multi-hop QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of integrating and interpreting key evidence in noisy documents for RAG systems to reduce hallucinations in LLMs.

Method: GraphAnchor dynamically updates a graph structure during retrieval to anchor salient entities and relations, guiding the LLM in knowledge evaluation and subquery formulation.

Result: Effective performance on multi-hop QA benchmarks, with improved attention to key information in retrieved documents.

Conclusion: GraphAnchor enhances RAG by transforming static graphs into active knowledge indices, improving LLM accuracy and attention modulation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Nevertheless, effectively integrating and interpreting key evidence scattered across noisy documents remains a critical challenge for existing RAG systems. In this paper, we propose GraphAnchor, a novel Graph-Anchored Knowledge Indexing approach that reconceptualizes graph structures from static knowledge representations into active, evolving knowledge indices. GraphAnchor incrementally updates a graph during iterative retrieval to anchor salient entities and relations, yielding a structured index that guides the LLM in evaluating knowledge sufficiency and formulating subsequent subqueries. The final answer is generated by jointly leveraging all retrieved documents and the final evolved graph. Experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAnchor, and reveal that GraphAnchor modulates the LLM's attention to more effectively associate key information distributed in retrieved documents. All code and data are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/GraphAnchor.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PHISH, a framework highlighting vulnerabilities in LLM personas, showing how adversarial inputs can manipulate traits without compromising overall utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies overlook how adversarial conversational history alone can reshape LLM personas, raising concerns for robustness in critical domains like mental health and education.

Method: Proposes PHISH, a black-box framework using semantically loaded cues in user queries to gradually induce reverse personas, validated across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs.

Result: PHISH successfully shifts personas, triggers collateral trait changes, and excels in multi-turn settings, with minimal impact on reasoning performance.

Conclusion: The findings reveal new vulnerabilities in LLM personas, emphasizing the need for context-resilient safeguards despite current brittle guardrails.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains such as education, mental health and customer support, where stable and consistent personas are critical for reliability. Yet, existing studies focus on narrative or role-playing tasks and overlook how adversarial conversational history alone can reshape induced personas. Black-box persona manipulation remains unexplored, raising concerns for robustness in realistic interactions. In response, we introduce the task of persona editing, which adversarially steers LLM traits through user-side inputs under a black-box, inference-only setting. To this end, we propose PHISH (Persona Hijacking via Implicit Steering in History), the first framework to expose a new vulnerability in LLM safety that embeds semantically loaded cues into user queries to gradually induce reverse personas. We also define a metric to quantify attack success. Across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs, PHISH predictably shifts personas, triggers collateral changes in correlated traits, and exhibits stronger effects in multi-turn settings. In high-risk domains mental health, tutoring, and customer support, PHISH reliably manipulates personas, validated by both human and LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Importantly, PHISH causes only a small reduction in reasoning benchmark performance, leaving overall utility largely intact while still enabling significant persona manipulation. While current guardrails offer partial protection, they remain brittle under sustained attack. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities in personas and highlight the need for context-resilient persona in LLMs. Our codebase and dataset is available at: https://github.com/Jivnesh/PHISH

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes DeepEra, a Deep Evidence Reranking Agent, to address semantic similarity but logical irrelevance issues in retrieval-augmented generation for scientific question answering, supported by a new dataset, SciRAG-SSLI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval methods struggle with semantically similar but logically irrelevant passages, reducing factual reliability in scientific question answering.

Method: The authors introduce DeepEra, integrating step-by-step reasoning to better evaluate candidate passages, and create SciRAG-SSLI, a large-scale dataset with 300K SciQA instances.

Result: DeepEra outperforms leading rerankers, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

Conclusion: This work is the first to comprehensively address SSLI issues in RAG frameworks, validated empirically with DeepEra and SciRAG-SSLI.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of scientific literature, scientific question answering (SciQA) has become increasingly critical for exploring and utilizing scientific knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating knowledge from external sources, thereby providing credible evidence for scientific question answering. But existing retrieval and reranking methods remain vulnerable to passages that are semantically similar but logically irrelevant, often reducing factual reliability and amplifying hallucinations.To address this challenge, we propose a Deep Evidence Reranking Agent (DeepEra) that integrates step-by-step reasoning, enabling more precise evaluation of candidate passages beyond surface-level semantics. To support systematic evaluation, we construct SciRAG-SSLI (Scientific RAG - Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant), a large-scale dataset comprising about 300K SciQA instances across 10 subjects, constructed from 10M scientific corpus. The dataset combines naturally retrieved contexts with systematically generated distractors to test logical robustness and factual grounding. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that our approach achieves superior retrieval performance compared to leading rerankers. To our knowledge, this work is the first to comprehensively study and empirically validate innegligible SSLI issues in two-stage RAG frameworks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TL-GRPO improves reasoning tasks like iterative optimization by enabling turn-level fine-grained optimization, outperforming standard GRPO and Bayesian methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with iterative optimization tasks where trajectory value depends on the best turn-level reward, not cumulative returns.

Method: Proposes Turn-Level GRPO (TL-GRPO), a lightweight RL algorithm using turn-level group sampling for fine-grained optimization.

Result: TL-GRPO outperforms standard GRPO and Bayesian optimization in analog circuit sizing, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 30B model.

Conclusion: TL-GRPO effectively addresses iterative optimization challenges, demonstrating strong generalization and practical utility.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in complex tasks through tool integration, which is typically framed as a Markov Decision Process and optimized with trajectory-level RL algorithms such as GRPO. However, a common class of reasoning tasks, iterative optimization, presents distinct challenges: the agent interacts with the same underlying environment state across turns, and the value of a trajectory is determined by the best turn-level reward rather than cumulative returns. Existing GRPO-based methods cannot perform fine-grained, turn-level optimization in such settings, while black-box optimization methods discard prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Turn-Level GRPO (TL-GRPO), a lightweight RL algorithm that performs turn-level group sampling for fine-grained optimization. We evaluate TL-GRPO on analog circuit sizing (ACS), a challenging scientific optimization task requiring multiple simulations and domain expertise. Results show that TL-GRPO outperforms standard GRPO and Bayesian optimization methods across various specifications. Furthermore, our 30B model trained with TL-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACS tasks under same simulation budget, demonstrating both strong generalization and practical utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Timely Machine, a framework redefining test-time scaling as wall-clock time for LLMs in agentic scenarios. It highlights the limitations of traditional methods and proposes Timely-RL to improve time budget awareness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the breakdown of traditional generation-length-based definitions in agentic scenarios with frequent tool calls, where tool latency affects inference time. The goal is to enhance LLMs' ability to dynamically adjust strategies based on time budgets.

Method: The paper proposes Timely Machine, which uses wall-clock time for test-time scaling, and Timely-Eval, a benchmark for evaluating performance. Timely-RL combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve temporal planning and adaptability.

Result: Results show smaller models perform better with fast feedback, while larger models excel in high-latency settings. Existing models struggle with time budget adaptation, but Timely-RL improves performance across Timely-Eval.

Conclusion: The work provides a new perspective on test-time scaling for LLMs in agentic scenarios, emphasizing the importance of time budget awareness and dynamic strategy adjustment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly tackle complex reasoning tasks, test-time scaling has become critical for enhancing capabilities. However, in agentic scenarios with frequent tool calls, the traditional generation-length-based definition breaks down: tool latency decouples inference time from generation length. We propose Timely Machine, redefining test-time as wall-clock time, where models dynamically adjust strategies based on time budgets. We introduce Timely-Eval, a benchmark spanning high-frequency tool calls, low-frequency tool calls, and time-constrained reasoning. By varying tool latency, we find smaller models excel with fast feedback through more interactions, while larger models dominate high-latency settings via superior interaction quality. Moreover, existing models fail to adapt reasoning to time budgets. We propose Timely-RL to address this gap. After cold-start supervised fine-tuning, we use reinforcement learning to enhance temporal planning. Timely-RL improves time budget awareness and consistently boosts performance across Timely-Eval. We hope our work offers a new perspective on test-time scaling for the agentic era.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for RAG systems in the medical domain.

Method: Developed the MRAG benchmark covering tasks in English and Chinese, using Wikipedia and Pubmed, and created the MRAG-Toolkit for systematic exploration of RAG components.

Result: RAG improves LLM reliability and reasoning quality but slightly reduces readability for long-form questions. Performance depends on retrieval methods, model sizes, and prompting strategies.

Conclusion: The MRAG benchmark and toolkit will be released to support further research and applications in the medical domain.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been swiftly adopted in scientific and clinical QA systems, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark in the medical domain is lacking. To address this gap, we introduce the Medical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) benchmark, covering various tasks in English and Chinese languages, and building a corpus with Wikipedia and Pubmed. Additionally, we develop the MRAG-Toolkit, facilitating systematic exploration of different RAG components. Our experiments reveal that: (a) RAG enhances LLM reliability across MRAG tasks. (b) the performance of RAG systems is influenced by retrieval approaches, model sizes, and prompting strategies. (c) While RAG improves usefulness and reasoning quality, LLM responses may become slightly less readable for long-form questions. We will release the MRAG-Bench's dataset and toolkit with CCBY-4.0 license upon acceptance, to facilitate applications from both academia and industry.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA benchmark reframes commonsense reasoning as logical composition over statement pairs, revealing models' limitations in negation-based questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks rely on single-label evaluation, missing nuanced plausibility relationships like joint plausibility or mutual exclusivity.

Method: The paper introduces LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA, evaluating models (instruction-tuned, reasoning-specialized, etc.) under zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: Models perform reasonably on conjunctive, moderately on disjunctive reasoning, but poorly on negation-based questions.

Conclusion: LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA highlights fundamental reasoning gaps and offers a framework for improving compositional commonsense reasoning.

Abstract: Commonsense reasoning often involves evaluating multiple plausible interpretations rather than selecting a single atomic answer, yet most benchmarks rely on single-label evaluation, obscuring whether statements are jointly plausible, mutually exclusive, or jointly implausible. We introduce LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA, a benchmark that re-frames commonsense reasoning as logical composition over pairs of atomic statements using plausibility-level operators (AND, OR, NEITHER/NOR). Evaluating instruction-tuned, reasoning-specialized, and fine-tuned models under zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, we find that while models perform reasonably on conjunctive and moderately on disjunctive reasoning, performance degrades sharply on negation-based questions. LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA exposes fundamental reasoning limitations and provides a controlled framework for advancing compositional commonsense reasoning.

TL;DR: Static single-prompt evaluations miss conversational vulnerabilities; multi-turn testing reveals length- and scaffold-dependent issues in LLM responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarking relies on single-prompt tests, missing real-world conversational dynamics where harm occurs.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on BoolQ dataset with varying conversation lengths and scaffolding conditions.

Result: Found model-specific vulnerabilities invisible in single-turn tests, showing limitations of static evaluations.

Conclusion: Multi-turn conversational settings are necessary to expose deployment-relevant vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Single-prompt evaluations dominate current LLM benchmarking, yet they fail to capture the conversational dynamics where real-world harm occurs. In this study, we examined whether conversation length affects response veracity by evaluating LLM performance on the BoolQ dataset under varying length and scaffolding conditions. Our results across three distinct LLMs revealed model-specific vulnerabilities that are invisible under single-turn testing. The length-dependent and scaffold-specific effects we observed demonstrate a fundamental limitation of static evaluations, as deployment-relevant vulnerabilities could only be spotted in a multi-turn conversational setting.

*Hoang-Quoc Nguyen-Son,Minh-Son Dao,Koji Zettsu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SearchLLM is a novel approach to detect LLM-paraphrased text by using search engines to find original sources and comparing similarities, improving existing detectors' accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the challenge of LLMs paraphrasing text while potentially distorting original meaning, and traditional methods failing to detect such paraphrased content.

Method: SearchLLM leverages search engines to locate original text sources and analyzes similarities between input and regenerated versions to identify LLM-paraphrased text.

Result: Experiments show SearchLLM enhances accuracy of existing detectors in identifying paraphrased text and helps prevent paraphrasing attacks.

Conclusion: SearchLLM effectively addresses the limitations of traditional detection methods by integrating seamlessly with existing detectors and improving their performance.

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), it has become common practice for users to draft text and utilize LLMs to enhance its quality through paraphrasing. However, this process can sometimes result in the loss or distortion of the original intended meaning. Due to the human-like quality of LLM-generated text, traditional detection methods often fail, particularly when text is paraphrased to closely mimic original content. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel approach named SearchLLM, designed to identify LLM-paraphrased text by leveraging search engine capabilities to locate potential original text sources. By analyzing similarities between the input and regenerated versions of candidate sources, SearchLLM effectively distinguishes LLM-paraphrased content. SearchLLM is designed as a proxy layer, allowing seamless integration with existing detectors to enhance their performance. Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate that SearchLLM consistently enhances the accuracy of recent detectors in detecting LLM-paraphrased text that closely mimics original content. Furthermore, SearchLLM also helps the detectors prevent paraphrasing attacks.

*Gaurav Maheshwari,Kevin El Haddad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using LLMs to dynamically generate supervision for training lightweight classifiers outperforms traditional zero and few-shot methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high inference cost and latency of deploying large language models (LLMs) for classification tasks.

Method: An iterative, agentic loop where the LLM curates training data, analyzes model performance, and synthesizes targeted examples to fix errors.

Result: Outperforms standard zero and few-shot baselines across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively act as data curators, enabling efficient classification without large-model deployment costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and high-capacity encoders have advanced zero and few-shot classification, but their inference cost and latency limit practical deployment. We propose training lightweight text classifiers using dynamically generated supervision from an LLM. Our method employs an iterative, agentic loop in which the LLM curates training data, analyzes model successes and failures, and synthesizes targeted examples to address observed errors. This closed-loop generation and evaluation process progressively improves data quality and adapts it to the downstream classifier and task. Across four widely used benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms standard zero and few-shot baselines. These results indicate that LLMs can serve effectively as data curators, enabling accurate and efficient classification without the operational cost of large-model deployment.

*Mingwei Sun,Qianlong Wang,Ruifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Retrieve-Refine-Calibrate (RRC) framework using LLMs to improve fact-checking accuracy by minimizing noise from irrelevant entities or evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fact-checking methods suffer from noise introduced by decomposition, leading to degraded accuracy.

Method: The RRC framework retrieves relevant evidence using claim entities, refines it to remove irrelevance, and calibrates low-confidence predictions.

Result: Experiments on HOVER and FEVEROUS-S datasets show superior performance over baseline methods.

Conclusion: The RRC framework effectively reduces noise and enhances verification accuracy in fact-checking.

Abstract: Fact-checking aims to verify the truthfulness of a claim based on the retrieved evidence. Existing methods typically follow a decomposition paradigm, in which a claim is broken down into sub-claims that are individually verified. However, the decomposition paradigm may introduce noise to the verification process due to irrelevant entities or evidence, ultimately degrading verification accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a Retrieve-Refine-Calibrate (RRC) framework based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the framework first identifies the entities mentioned in the claim and retrieves evidence relevant to them. Then, it refines the retrieved evidence based on the claim to reduce irrelevant information. Finally, it calibrates the verification process by re-evaluating low-confidence predictions. Experiments on two popular fact-checking datasets (HOVER and FEVEROUS-S) demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance compared with competitive baselines.

TL;DR: Attention-MoA is a novel MoA framework leveraging Inter-agent Semantic Attention and adaptive mechanisms to enhance collaboration among LLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoA methods lack deep semantic interaction, limiting their ability to correct hallucinations and refine logic.

Method: Introduces Inter-agent Semantic Attention and an Inter-layer Residual Module with Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism.

Result: Achieves superior performance on benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0 (91.15% LC Win Rate) and MT-Bench (8.83 score).

Conclusion: Attention-MoA enables smaller models to outperform larger proprietary ones, proving its efficacy.

Abstract: As the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts from parameter scaling to inference-time collaboration, the Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) framework has emerged as a general paradigm to harness collective intelligence by layering diverse models. While recent MoA variants have introduced dynamic routing and residual connections to improve efficiency, these methods often fail to facilitate deep semantic interaction between agents, limiting the system's ability to actively correct hallucinations and refine logic. In this paper, we introduce Attention-MoA, a novel MoA-based framework that redefines collaboration through Inter-agent Semantic Attention. Complemented by an Inter-layer Residual Module with Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism, our architecture mitigates information degradation in deep layers while improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK demonstrate that Attention-MoA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 91.15% Length-Controlled Win Rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and dominating in 10 out of 12 capabilities on FLASK. Notably, Attention-MoA enables an ensemble of small open-source models to outperform massive proprietary models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, achieving an MT-Bench score of 8.83 and an AlpacaEval 2.0 LC Win Rate of 77.36%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage VLLMs in industrial applications despite their drawbacks like high computational costs and slower speeds.

Method: Introduces AuroraEdge-V-2B with a compression-fusion method to improve inference efficiency.

Result: Achieves higher scores on benchmarks, reduces visual tokens and FLOPs, and enables easier deployment.

Conclusion: AuroraEdge-V-2B effectively addresses VLLM limitations for industrial use.

Abstract: Recently, due to the advancement of multimodal technology, people are attempting to use visual large language models (VLLMs) in industrial production. Many deep learning models (DLMs) deployed in the production environment are gradually being replaced by VLLMs. Compared with DLMs, VLLMs have some advantages in industrial applications: (1) Their strong generalization ability enables them to perform well across a wide range of tasks. (2) They are flexible and can deal with unfamiliar samples through context learning quickly. However, VLLMs also have obvious drawbacks: (1) VLLMs do not perform as well as custom-developed DLMs in specific domains. (2) The number of parameters in VLLMs is generally quite large, and their deployment requires substantial computational resources. (3) VLLMs generally operate much slower than DLMs, making real-time response challenging to achieve. To better utilize VLLMs in industrial applications, we introduce AuroraEdge-V-2B in this work, a compact, robust, and high-speed VLLM designed for edge deployment. To make the model run faster, we also propose a compression-fusion method to improve inference efficiency. AuroraEdge-V-2B has the following notable features: (1) Easy deployment and faster: It has only 2B parameters and is highly suitable for edge deployment, offering better real-time performance. (2) Fewer visual tokens and cheaper: It significantly reduces the number of visual tokens in the decoding process, thereby reducing the floating-point operations by half during inference and making it cheaper to use. (3) Strong performance: It gets a higher score on 9 benchmarks than models with the same number of parameter (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B, InternVL-2.5-2B).

Method: Fine-tunes LLMs with CVSS corpus, uses tri-task learning and chain of modality, generates preference pairs via self-sampling and back-translation, and applies preference optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm PROST-LLM's effectiveness in improving S2ST capabilities.

Conclusion: PROST-LLM successfully bridges the gap in LLMs' S2ST performance.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many tasks, their application to Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) is underexplored and hindered by data scarcity. To bridge this gap, we propose PROST-LLM (PROgressive Speech-to-speech Translation) to enhance the S2ST capabilities in LLMs progressively. First, we fine-tune the LLMs with the CVSS corpus, employing designed tri-task learning and chain of modality methods to boost the initial performance. Then, leveraging the fine-tuned model, we generate preference pairs through self-sampling and back-translation without human evaluation. Finally, these preference pairs are used for preference optimization to enhance the model's S2ST capability further. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed PROST-LLM in improving the S2ST capability of LLMs.

Result: RP-Reasoner outperforms baselines on RPEval, resolving 80% of bad cases in a commercial assistant, demonstrating the effectiveness of pragmatic reasoning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of pragmatic reasoning to mitigate irrational personalization, improving LLM-powered assistants' performance and user experience.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered assistants have recently integrated memory mechanisms that record user preferences, leading to more personalized and user-aligned responses. However, irrelevant personalized memories are often introduced into the context, interfering with the LLM's intent understanding. To comprehensively investigate the dual effects of personalization, we develop RPEval, a benchmark comprising a personalized intent reasoning dataset and a multi-granularity evaluation protocol. RPEval reveals the widespread phenomenon of irrational personalization in existing LLMs and, through error pattern analysis, illustrates its negative impact on user experience. Finally, we introduce RP-Reasoner, which treats memory utilization as a pragmatic reasoning process, enabling the selective integration of personalized information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms carefully designed baselines on RPEval, and resolves 80% of the bad cases observed in a large-scale commercial personalized assistant, highlighting the potential of pragmatic reasoning to mitigate irrational personalization.

Motivation: Addresses the lack of diversity in MultiLexNorm by incorporating Asian languages from varied scripts, highlighting the challenge of NLP model performance on informal, sociolectic-rich social media data.

Method: Extends MultiLexNorm with 5 Asian languages across 4 scripts, tests SOTA model, and introduces a new LLM-based architecture for improved robustness.

Result: SOTA model underperforms on new languages; proposed LLM-based architecture demonstrates more robust performance.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for diverse benchmarks and robust models for lexical normalization, with insights for future task improvements.

Abstract: Social media data has been of interest to Natural Language Processing (NLP) practitioners for over a decade, because of its richness in information, but also challenges for automatic processing. Since language use is more informal, spontaneous, and adheres to many different sociolects, the performance of NLP models often deteriorates. One solution to this problem is to transform data to a standard variant before processing it, which is also called lexical normalization. There has been a wide variety of benchmarks and models proposed for this task. The MultiLexNorm benchmark proposed to unify these efforts, but it consists almost solely of languages from the Indo-European language family in the Latin script. Hence, we propose an extension to MultiLexNorm, which covers 5 Asian languages from different language families in 4 different scripts. We show that the previous state-of-the-art model performs worse on the new languages and propose a new architecture based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which shows more robust performance. Finally, we analyze remaining errors, revealing future directions for this task.

Motivation: Addressing the underperformance of massively multilingual models on low-resource and unseen languages efficiently.

Method: Typologically Informed Parameter Aggregation (TIPA) constructs proxy adapters by weighting existing adapters based on typological similarity, integrated into MAD-X.

Result: TIPA outperforms baselines like English-only fine-tuning across five NLP tasks and 230+ languages, especially benefiting languages without dedicated adapters.

Conclusion: Typological aggregation offers a viable, training-free alternative to language-specific modules.

Abstract: Massively multilingual language models enable cross-lingual generalization but underperform on low-resource and unseen languages. While adapter-based fine-tuning offers a parameter-efficient solution, training language-specific adapters at scale remains costly. We introduce Typologically Informed Parameter Aggregation (TIPA), a training-free method that constructs proxy language adapters by aggregating existing ones, weighted by typological similarity. Integrated into the MAD-X framework, these proxies enable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer without additional training. We evaluate TIPA on five NLP tasks and over 230 languages. TIPA consistently outperforms or matches baselines such as English-only fine-tuning or selecting the typologically closest language adapter. We see the largest gains for languages lacking dedicated adapters. Our results demonstrate that typologically informed aggregation provides a viable alternative to language-specific modules without any training needed.

Result: Sycophancy signals are most separable in attention heads, and probes trained on TruthfulQA transfer well to other benchmarks. Limited overlap with 

Conclusion: Targeted linear interventions in attention activations can effectively mitigate sycophancy, leveraging the internal geometry of these signals.

Abstract: We find that correct-to-incorrect sycophancy signals are most linearly separable within multi-head attention activations. Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, we train linear probes across the residual stream, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and attention layers to analyze where these signals emerge. Although separability appears in the residual stream and MLPs, steering using these probes is most effective in a sparse subset of middle-layer attention heads. Using TruthfulQA as the base dataset, we find that probes trained on it transfer effectively to other factual QA benchmarks. Furthermore, comparing our discovered direction to previously identified "truthful" directions reveals limited overlap, suggesting that factual accuracy, and deference resistance, arise from related but distinct mechanisms. Attention-pattern analysis further indicates that the influential heads attend disproportionately to expressions of user doubt, contributing to sycophantic shifts. Overall, these findings suggest that sycophancy can be mitigated through simple, targeted linear interventions that exploit the internal geometry of attention activations.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates methods for making gradient-based influence estimation in large language models more tractable, favoring a greedily selected subset of model components over full gradients or random projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based influence estimation in large language models is computationally challenging due to high-dimensional gradients, and current subset selection methods lack systematic evaluation.

Method: The study compares low-dimensional representations from architecturally informed component subsets and random projections, using a novel benchmark to assess effectiveness.

Result: A greedily selected subset of components captures influence information more effectively and efficiently than full gradients or random projections.

Conclusion: Targeted component selection is a practical and efficient strategy for improving the computational feasibility of instance-based explanations in large models.

Abstract: Gradient-based methods for instance-based explanation for large language models (LLMs) are hindered by the immense dimensionality of model gradients. In practice, influence estimation is restricted to a subset of model parameters to make computation tractable, but this subset is often chosen ad hoc and rarely justified by systematic evaluation. This paper investigates if it is better to create low-dimensional representations by selecting a small, architecturally informed subset of model components or by projecting the full gradients into a lower-dimensional space. Using a novel benchmark, we show that a greedily selected subset of components captures the information about training data influence needed for a retrieval task more effectively than either the full gradient or random projection. We further find that this approach is more computationally efficient than random projection, demonstrating that targeted component selection is a practical strategy for making instance-based explanations of large models more computationally feasible.

TL;DR: PLawBench is introduced to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice, revealing their limitations in fine-grained legal reasoning despite assessing 10 state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal benchmarks fail to capture the complexity and reasoning demands of real legal practice, necessitating a more practical evaluation framework.

Method: PLawBench models real-world legal workflows through three task categories (public consultation, case analysis, document generation) with 850 questions and expert-designed rubrics.

Result: None of the 10 evaluated LLMs performed strongly, highlighting gaps in their fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: PLawBench underscores the need for improved evaluation and development of legal LLMs to better address real-world legal challenges.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to legal domain-specific tasks, evaluating their ability to perform legal work in real-world settings has become essential. However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of evaluating long-term memory in agents by creating a dynamic benchmark that avoids fixed questions and covers diverse memory skills.

Method: EMemBench generates questions from agent trajectories in text and visual game environments, using templates with verifiable ground truth. It evaluates agents with LMs/VLMs via in-context prompting.

Result: Results show unsaturated performance, with induction and spatial reasoning as key bottlenecks. Persistent memory helps text-based agents but not consistently VLMs, indicating visual episodic memory remains challenging.

Conclusion: EMemBench highlights gaps in agent memory, particularly in visual settings, and confirms its difficulty through human studies, suggesting future work is needed.

Abstract: We introduce EMemBench, a programmatic benchmark for evaluating long-term memory of agents through interactive games. Rather than using a fixed set of questions, EMemBench generates questions from each agent's own trajectory, covering both text and visual game environments. Each template computes verifiable ground truth from underlying game signals, with controlled answerability and balanced coverage over memory skills: single/multi-hop recall, induction, temporal, spatial, logical, and adversarial. We evaluate memory agents with strong LMs/VLMs as backbones, using in-context prompting as baselines. Across 15 text games and multiple visual seeds, results are far from saturated: induction and spatial reasoning are persistent bottlenecks, especially in visual setting. Persistent memory yields clear gains for open backbones on text games, but improvements are less consistent for VLM agents, suggesting that visually grounded episodic memory remains an open challenge. A human study further confirms the difficulty of EMemBench.

Motivation: Address algorithmic bias in AES systems against ESL learners, particularly high-proficiency ones, due to spurious correlations learned from native-speaker corpora.

Method: Used a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model and applied contrastive learning with triplet construction (Contrastive Learning with Matched Essay Pairs) on 17,161 matched essay pairs.

Result: Reduced scoring disparity for high-proficiency ESL essays by 39.9% (from 10.3% to 6.2%) while keeping QWK at 0.76. Linguistic analysis showed disentanglement of sentence complexity from grammatical errors.

Conclusion: Contrastive learning effectively mitigates bias in AES systems for ESL learners without compromising scoring accuracy.

Abstract: As Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems are increasingly used in high-stakes educational settings, concerns regarding algorithmic bias against English as a Second Language (ESL) learners have increased. Current Transformer-based regression models trained primarily on native-speaker corpora often learn spurious correlations between surface-level L2 linguistic features and essay quality. In this study, we conduct a bias study of a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model using the ASAP 2.0 and ELLIPSE datasets, revealing a constrained score scaling for high-proficiency ESL writing where high-proficiency ESL essays receive scores 10.3% lower than Native speaker essays of identical human-rated quality. To mitigate this, we propose applying contrastive learning with a triplet construction strategy: Contrastive Learning with Matched Essay Pairs. We constructed a dataset of 17,161 matched essay pairs and fine-tuned the model using Triplet Margin Loss to align the latent representations of ESL and Native writing. Our approach reduced the high-proficiency scoring disparity by 39.9% (to a 6.2% gap) while maintaining a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.76. Post-hoc linguistic analysis suggests the model successfully disentangled sentence complexity from grammatical error, preventing the penalization of valid L2 syntactic structures.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM-based pipeline for automating the annotation of longitudinal information in radiology reports, outperforming existing methods with higher F1-scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for annotating temporal changes in radiology reports are labor-intensive and lack standardization, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: An LLM-based pipeline identifies relevant sentences and tracks disease progression, evaluated using Qwen2.5-32B on 500 manually annotated reports.

Result: The pipeline achieved 11.3% and 5.3% higher F1-scores for longitudinal detection and disease tracking, respectively, compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: LLM-based annotation is efficient and effective, providing a standardized benchmark for evaluating radiology report generation models.

Abstract: Longitudinal information in radiology reports refers to the sequential tracking of findings across multiple examinations over time, which is crucial for monitoring disease progression and guiding clinical decisions. Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models.

*Debtanu Datta,Mohan Kishore Chilukuri,Yash Kumar,Saptarshi Ghosh,Muhammad Bilal Zafar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs fail due to hallucinations and low-resource effects, revealing that hallucination detectors remain relatively accurate in low-resource languages compared to task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether hallucination detectors are affected by the low-resource effect, given LLMs' pervasive hallucination and language performance gaps.

Method: Experiments conducted on five tasks across three domains using four LLMs and three hallucination detectors, comparing performance in high- and low-resource languages.

Result: Task accuracy drops significantly in low-resource languages, but detector accuracy drops are much smaller, suggesting LLMs encode uncertainty signals internally.

Conclusion: Hallucination detectors are robust within languages but struggle cross-lingually without supervision, indicating LLMs retain uncertainty awareness even in low-resource settings.

Abstract: LLMs, while outperforming humans in a wide range of tasks, can still fail in unanticipated ways. We focus on two pervasive failure modes: (i) hallucinations, where models produce incorrect information about the world, and (ii) the low-resource effect, where the models show impressive performance in high-resource languages like English but the performance degrades significantly in low-resource languages like Bengali. We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English). However, the drop in detectors' accuracy is often several times smaller than the drop in task accuracy. Our findings suggest that even in low-resource languages, the internal mechanisms of LLMs might encode signals about their uncertainty. Further, the detectors are robust within language (even for non-English) and in multilingual setups, but not in cross-lingual settings without in-language supervision.

*Paul Youssef,Jörg Schlötterer,Christin Seifert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-Tokens replace costly IKE demonstrations for updating LLMs, offering comparable or better performance with greater efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the inefficiency and high cost of in-context knowledge editing (IKE) by introducing persuasion tokens (P-Tokens) as a more practical alternative.

Method: P-Tokens are special tokens trained to mimic IKE demonstrations, eliminating the need for fact-specific examples. They were tested on two editing datasets and three LLMs.

Result: P-Tokens perform similarly or better than IKE, show robustness to distractors, and improve with more tokens.

Conclusion: P-Tokens provide a scalable and efficient solution for knowledge editing in LLMs, overcoming IKE's limitations.

Abstract: In-context knowledge editing (IKE) is a promising technique for updating Large Language Models (LLMs) with new information. However, IKE relies on lengthy, fact-specific demonstrations which are costly to create and consume significant context window space. In this paper, we introduce persuasion tokens (P-Tokens) -- special tokens trained to replicate the effect of IKE demonstrations, enabling efficient knowledge editing without requiring fact-specific demonstrations. We evaluate P-Tokens across two editing datasets and three LLMs, demonstrating performance comparable to, and often exceeding, IKE. We further find that editing performance is robust to distractors with small negative effects to neighboring facts, and that increasing the number of P-Tokens improves performance. Our work addresses key limitations of IKE and provides a more practical and scalable alternative for editing LLMs.

*Gaurav Negi,MA Waskow,Paul Buitelaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can serve as automatic annotators for fine-grained opinion analysis, reducing human effort and cost in creating labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for fine-grained opinion analysis is labor-intensive and costly, especially across diverse domains. The study explores using LLMs to address this challenge.

Method: A declarative annotation pipeline is used to reduce variability in manual prompt engineering. The pipeline includes adjudication of multiple labels by LLMs for final annotations, tested on ASTE and ACOS tasks.

Result: LLMs achieve high Inter-Annotator Agreement, demonstrating feasibility as automatic annotators and adjudicators for fine-grained opinion analysis.

Conclusion: LLMs significantly reduce the cost and effort required to create fine-grained opinion-annotated datasets, making them practical for diverse applications.

Abstract: Fine-grained opinion analysis of text provides a detailed understanding of expressed sentiments, including the addressed entity. Although this level of detail is sound, it requires considerable human effort and substantial cost to annotate opinions in datasets for training models, especially across diverse domains and real-world applications. We explore the feasibility of LLMs as automatic annotators for fine-grained opinion analysis, addressing the shortage of domain-specific labelled datasets. In this work, we use a declarative annotation pipeline. This approach reduces the variability of manual prompt engineering when using LLMs to identify fine-grained opinion spans in text. We also present a novel methodology for an LLM to adjudicate multiple labels and produce final annotations. After trialling the pipeline with models of different sizes for the Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) and Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment (ACOS) analysis tasks, we show that LLMs can serve as automatic annotators and adjudicators, achieving high Inter-Annotator Agreement across individual LLM-based annotators. This reduces the cost and human effort needed to create these fine-grained opinion-annotated datasets.

*Carolin Holtermann,Florian Schneider,Anne Lauscher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Surface-over-Semantics (SoS) tendencies in T2I models, revealing that most models prioritize surface language forms over semantics, leading to stereotypical depictions across languages and cultures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive analysis on T2I models' sensitivity to input languages and their tendency to produce culturally stereotypical outputs.

Method: Created prompts covering 171 cultural identities in 14 languages, tested on seven T2I models, and introduced a novel measure to quantify SoS tendencies.

Result: All but one model showed strong SoS tendencies in at least two languages, with effects intensifying across T2I text encoders. Stereotypical visual depictions were frequent.

Conclusion: T2I models often prioritize surface language forms over semantics, leading to culturally biased outputs, highlighting the need for improved model robustness.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly employed by users worldwide. However, prior research has pointed to the high sensitivity of T2I towards particular input languages - when faced with languages other than English (i.e., different surface forms of the same prompt), T2I models often produce culturally stereotypical depictions, prioritizing the surface over the prompt's semantics. Yet a comprehensive analysis of this behavior, which we dub Surface-over-Semantics (SoS), is missing. We present the first analysis of T2I models' SoS tendencies. To this end, we create a set of prompts covering 171 cultural identities, translated into 14 languages, and use it to prompt seven T2I models. To quantify SoS tendencies across models, languages, and cultures, we introduce a novel measure and analyze how the tendencies we identify manifest visually. We show that all but one model exhibit strong surface-level tendency in at least two languages, with this effect intensifying across the layers of T2I text encoders. Moreover, these surface tendencies frequently correlate with stereotypical visual depictions.

*Leonard S. Pleiss,Maximilian Schiffer,Robert K. von Weizsäcker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show a decline in performance as tasks require more fluid intelligence (reasoning) rather than crystallized intelligence (recall), highlighting limitations in systematic generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs' capabilities stem from recall (crystallized intelligence) or reasoning (fluid intelligence), using chess as a controlled testbed.

Method: Evaluated various GPT models on chess positions ranging from memorization-based to novel, requiring first-principles reasoning, using scalable engine evaluations.

Result: Performance degrades with increasing reasoning demands, collapsing to random levels in out-of-distribution tasks. Newer models show limited improvement for such tasks.

Conclusion: Current LLM architectures lack robust fluid intelligence, indicating the need for mechanisms beyond scaling to achieve systematic generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet it remains unclear to what extent these reflect sophisticated recall (crystallized intelligence) or reasoning ability (fluid intelligence). We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity. These results suggest current architectures remain limited in systematic generalization, highlighting the need for mechanisms beyond scale to achieve robust fluid intelligence.

*João A. Leite,Olesya Razuvayevskaya,Kalina Bontcheva,Carolina Scarton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces persuasive adversarial attacks on AFC systems using generative LLMs, showing significant performance degradation in claim verification and evidence retrieval on FEVER benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial frameworks overlook persuasion techniques used in disinformation, leaving AFC systems vulnerable.

Method: A generative LLM rephrases claims using 15 persuasion techniques across 6 categories, tested via decoupled evaluation on FEVER and FEVEROUS benchmarks.

Result: Persuasion attacks notably reduce verification accuracy and evidence retrieval effectiveness.

Conclusion: Persuasion techniques are potent adversarial tools, underscoring the need for more robust AFC systems.

Abstract: Automated fact-checking (AFC) systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, enabling false claims to evade detection. Existing adversarial frameworks typically rely on injecting noise or altering semantics, yet no existing framework exploits the adversarial potential of persuasion techniques, which are widely used in disinformation campaigns to manipulate audiences. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of persuasive adversarial attacks on AFCs by employing a generative LLM to rephrase claims using persuasion techniques. Considering 15 techniques grouped into 6 categories, we study the effects of persuasion on both claim verification and evidence retrieval using a decoupled evaluation strategy. Experiments on the FEVER and FEVEROUS benchmarks show that persuasion attacks can substantially degrade both verification performance and evidence retrieval. Our analysis identifies persuasion techniques as a potent class of adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for more robust AFC systems.

*Elias Schuhmacher,Andrianos Michail,Juri Opitz,Rico Sennrich,Simon Clematide*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework evaluates biases in embedding models, revealing positional and language biases. An attention calibration method is proposed to improve discoverability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in embedding models' reflection of document segments, ensuring fair representation.

Method: Introduces a permutation-based evaluation framework and an inference-time attention calibration method.

Result: Finds systematic biases favoring early segments and higher-resource languages; calibration improves fairness.

Conclusion: Proposed methods enhance segment discoverability and reduce biases in embedding-based searches.

Abstract: To be discoverable in an embedding-based search process, each part of a document should be reflected in its embedding representation. To quantify any potential reflection biases, we introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework. With this, we observe that state-of-the-art embedding models exhibit systematic positional and language biases when documents are longer and consist of multiple segments. Specifically, early segments and segments in higher-resource languages like English are over-represented, while later segments and segments in lower-resource languages are marginalized. In our further analysis, we find that the positional bias stems from front-loaded attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings, where early tokens receive more attention. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an inference-time attention calibration method that redistributes attention more evenly across document positions, increasing discoverabiltiy of later segments. Our evaluation framework and attention calibration is available at https://github.com/impresso/fair-sentence-transformers

### [102] [Strategies for Span Labeling with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16946)
*Danil Semin,Ondřej Dušek,Zdeněk Kasner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Generative LLMs lack explicit input referencing for span labeling tasks, leading to inconsistent prompting strategies. The paper categorizes these into tagging, indexing, and matching, and introduces LogitMatch to improve alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in prompting strategies for span labeling tasks in generative LLMs due to their lack of explicit input referencing mechanisms.

Method: Categorizes strategies into tagging, indexing, and matching. Introduces LogitMatch, a constrained decoding method enforcing output alignment with valid input spans.

Result: Tagging is robust, but LogitMatch improves matching-based methods by eliminating span matching issues and outperforms others in some setups.

Conclusion: LogitMatch enhances generative LLMs for span labeling, addressing limitations of existing strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text analysis tasks, such as named entity recognition or error detection. Unlike encoder-based models, however, generative architectures lack an explicit mechanism to refer to specific parts of their input. This leads to a variety of ad-hoc prompting strategies for span labeling, often with inconsistent results. In this paper, we categorize these strategies into three families: tagging the input text, indexing numerical positions of spans, and matching span content. To address the limitations of content matching, we introduce LogitMatch, a new constrained decoding method that forces the model's output to align with valid input spans. We evaluate all methods across four diverse tasks. We find that while tagging remains a robust baseline, LogitMatch improves upon competitive matching-based methods by eliminating span matching issues and outperforms other strategies in some setups.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SemanticALLI addresses inefficiency in AI pipelines by caching structured intermediates, boosting hit rates and reducing LLM calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI pipelines redundantly reconstruct identical logic despite novel phrasing, which conventional caching fails to address.

Method: SemanticALLI decomposes generation into Analytic Intent Resolution and Visualization Synthesis, making intermediates cacheable.

Result: Structured caching achieves an 83.10% hit rate vs. 38.7% baseline, reducing 4,023 LLM calls with low latency.

Conclusion: Caching at structured checkpoints maximizes efficiency, even when user inputs vary.

Abstract: Agentic AI pipelines suffer from a hidden inefficiency: they frequently reconstruct identical intermediate logic, such as metric normalization or chart scaffolding, even when the user's natural language phrasing is entirely novel. Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.
  We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.
  The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The NSED protocol introduces a dynamic MoM architecture using a knapsack-like model selection and macro-scale RNN for iterative refinement, enabling small models to outperform large ones efficiently while ensuring alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon traditional MoE by dynamically selecting expert models during runtime, optimizing performance and alignment without scaling hardware demands.

Method: Uses a Dynamic Expertise Broker for model selection, a macro-scale RNN for deliberation, and peer review with quadratic voting for consensus.

Result: Small models (less than 20B) match or exceed 100B+ models in performance, with improved alignment and reduced sycophancy.

Conclusion: NSED establishes a new efficiency frontier, proving dynamic, trustless collaboration among small models can outperform monolithic large models.

Abstract: This paper introduces the N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) protocol, a Runtime Mixture-of-Models (MoM) architecture that constructs emergent composite models from a plurality of distinct expert agents. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier. Furthermore, testing on the DarkBench safety suite reveals intrinsic alignment properties, with peer-mediated correction reducing sycophancy scores below that of any individual agent.

TL;DR: DSGym introduces a standardized, modular framework for evaluating and training data science agents, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks with a live, extensible testbed and expanded task coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data science benchmarks suffer from fragmented evaluation interfaces, narrow task coverage, and lack of rigorous data grounding, hindering cross-benchmark comparisons and allowing tasks to be solved without data.

Method: DSGym offers a modular architecture for adding tasks, agents, and tools, alongside curated task suites like DSGym-Tasks, DSBio, and DSPredict. It supports agent training via an execution-verified data synthesis pipeline.

Result: A case study trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: DSGym provides a rigorous, end-to-end evaluation and training platform for data science agents, enabling realistic assessment of their ability to plan, implement, and validate analyses.

Abstract: Data science agents promise to accelerate discovery and insight-generation by turning data into executable analyses and findings. Yet existing data science benchmarks fall short due to fragmented evaluation interfaces that make cross-benchmark comparison difficult, narrow task coverage and a lack of rigorous data grounding. In particular, we show that a substantial portion of tasks in current benchmarks can be solved without using the actual data. To address these limitations, we introduce DSGym, a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments. Unlike static benchmarks, DSGym provides a modular architecture that makes it easy to add tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools, positioning it as a live, extensible testbed. We curate DSGym-Tasks, a holistic task suite that standardizes and refines existing benchmarks via quality and shortcut solvability filtering. We further expand coverage with (1) DSBio: expert-derived bioinformatics tasks grounded in literature and (2) DSPredict: challenging prediction tasks spanning domains such as computer vision, molecular prediction, and single-cell perturbation. Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline. As a case study, we build a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks. Overall, DSGym enables rigorous end-to-end measurement of whether agents can plan, implement, and validate data analyses in realistic scientific context.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Doc2AHP bridges LLMs' generalization with decision theory rigor, using AHP principles to ensure structural consistency and reasoning reliability without expert intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack structural consistency in complex tasks, while classical methods like AHP are labor-intensive. Doc2AHP aims to combine LLMs' generalization with AHP's rigor.

Method: Doc2AHP leverages AHP principles to guide LLMs in a structured search, introduces multi-agent weighting, and adaptive consistency optimization for numerical consistency.

Result: Empirical results show Doc2AHP enables non-experts to build high-quality decision models and outperforms generative baselines in logical completeness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Doc2AHP effectively combines LLMs and AHP, improving decision-making scalability and reliability without expert dependency.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable proficiency in semantic understanding, they often struggle to ensure structural consistency and reasoning reliability in complex decision-making tasks that demand rigorous logic. Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an "expert bottleneck" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the risk of LLMs acquiescing to inappropriate patient requests in clinical settings, despite their potential for decision support.

Method: A multi-agent simulation framework (SycoEval-EM) tests 20 LLMs across 1,875 encounters in three Choosing Wisely scenarios, measuring acquiescence rates under adversarial persuasion.

Result: Acquiescence rates varied widely (0-100%), with higher vulnerability for imaging requests (38.8%) than opioids (25.0%). Persuasion tactics were equally effective (30.0-36.0%), showing general susceptibility.

Conclusion: Static benchmarks fail to predict LLM safety under social pressure, underscoring the need for adversarial multi-turn testing in clinical AI certification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in clinical decision support yet risk acquiescing to patient pressure for inappropriate care. We introduce SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework evaluating LLM robustness through adversarial patient persuasion in emergency medicine. Across 20 LLMs and 1,875 encounters spanning three Choosing Wisely scenarios, acquiescence rates ranged from 0-100\%. Models showed higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8\%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0\%), with model capability poorly predicting robustness. All persuasion tactics proved equally effective (30.0-36.0\%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness. Our findings demonstrate that static benchmarks inadequately predict safety under social pressure, necessitating multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI certification.

TL;DR: Traditional ML outperforms transformer-based methods in medical classification, while fine-tuned Gemma variants performed worst. Gemini 2.5 showed mixed results, excelling only in image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare traditional ML with contemporary transformer-based techniques in medical classification tasks using multimodal datasets.

Method: Evaluated three model classes: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants) on four datasets with consistent metrics.

Result: Classical ML performed best overall, especially on text tasks. Gemini 2.5 was competitive in image tasks, while LoRA-tuned Gemma variants underperformed consistently.

Conclusion: Traditional ML remains reliable for medical classification; foundation models are not universally superior, and PEFT effectiveness depends heavily on adaptation strategy.

Abstract: The combination of multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up new possibilities for medical classification. This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding which underlying capabilities (e.g., planning, state tracking) are most critical for improving AI agents' performance in long-horizon, multi-turn tasks.

Method: Developed an oracle counterfactual framework and procedurally generated tasks to isolate and measure the impact of specific oracle skills (e.g., perfect planning) on agent performance.

Result: Planning consistently boosted performance, while other skills' usefulness depended on the environment and language model.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into prioritizing skill advancements for AI agents in complex multi-turn environments.

Abstract: Large language models can perform well on many isolated tasks, yet they continue to struggle on multi-turn, long-horizon agentic problems that require skills such as planning, state tracking, and long context processing. In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model. Our work sheds light on the challenges of multi-turn agentic environments to guide the future efforts in the development of AI agents and language models.

TL;DR: AgentsEval is a multi-agent framework designed to evaluate medical imaging reports by mimicking radiologists' diagnostic workflow, providing structured and interpretable feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for medical imaging reports lack structured diagnostic logic, leading to unreliable and clinically irrelevant judgments.

Method: AgentsEval divides evaluation into steps like criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, using multi-agent stream reasoning.

Result: The framework delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations, robust under various perturbations.

Conclusion: AgentsEval advances transparent and clinically grounded assessment, enhancing trust in AI-generated medical reports.

Abstract: Evaluating the clinical correctness and reasoning fidelity of automatically generated medical imaging reports remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods often fail to capture the structured diagnostic logic that underlies radiological interpretation, resulting in unreliable judgments and limited clinical relevance. We introduce AgentsEval, a multi-agent stream reasoning framework that emulates the collaborative diagnostic workflow of radiologists. By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback. We also construct a multi-domain perturbation-based benchmark covering five medical report datasets with diverse imaging modalities and controlled semantic variations. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations. This framework represents a step toward transparent and clinically grounded assessment of medical report generation systems, fostering trustworthy integration of large language models into clinical practice.

TL;DR: LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 is a 560B-parameter open-source MoE model excelling in agentic reasoning, generalization, and robustness through advanced training frameworks and noise-resistant design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model capable of handling complex tool interactions and noisy real-world environments.

Method: Unified training framework combining domain-parallel expert training, fusion, and co-design of data/environments/algorithms. Uses DORA for stable multi-environment training and Heavy Thinking mode for test-time scaling.

Result: Achieves top performance on agentic benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization and robustness in noisy environments.

Conclusion: The model's success lies in its innovative training approach, noise-resistant design, and advanced reasoning capabilities, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601, a 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model with superior agentic reasoning capability. LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.

### [112] [An Efficient Insect-inspired Approach for Visual Point-goal Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16806)
*Lu Yihe,Barbara Webb*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An insect-inspired agent for visual point-goal navigation combines models of insect brain structures for associative learning and path integration, achieving SOTA performance at much lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to replicate insect navigation abilities, particularly learning and refining paths between food and nest, using simplified models of insect brain structures.

Method: The agent abstracts two insect brain structures implicated in associative learning and path integration, tested in Habitat's point-goal navigation task and realistic simulations.

Result: The agent matches recent SOTA models' performance with significantly lower computational cost and remains robust under perturbations in realistic environments.

Conclusion: Insect-inspired navigation models offer efficient, robust alternatives to computationally expensive SOTA approaches.

Abstract: In this work we develop a novel insect-inspired agent for visual point-goal navigation. This combines abstracted models of two insect brain structures that have been implicated, respectively, in associative learning and path integration. We draw an analogy between the formal benchmark of the Habitat point-goal navigation task and the ability of insects to learn and refine visually guided paths around obstacles between a discovered food location and their nest. We demonstrate that the simple insect-inspired agent exhibits performance comparable to recent SOTA models at many orders of magnitude less computational cost. Testing in a more realistic simulated environment shows the approach is robust to perturbations.

*Ian B. de Haan,Peter van der Putten,Max van Duijn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes reasoning-oriented LLMs' performance in Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, showing increased robustness but no fundamental new ToM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether reasoning-oriented LLMs demonstrate fundamentally new Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities or simply improved robustness in solving tasks.

Method: Novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and established benchmarks are used to evaluate reasoning models trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).

Result: Reasoning models show consistent robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations, but gains are attributed to better solution-finding rather than new ToM reasoning.

Conclusion: The study suggests evaluating LLMs' social-cognitive behavior should focus on robustness improvements, not assuming fundamental ToM advancements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) tests, prompting debate about the nature and true performance of the underlying capabilities. At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.

### [114] [MAGE-KT: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing with Subgraph Retrieval and Asymmetric Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16886)
*Chi Yu,Hongyu Yuan,Zhiyi Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGE-KT proposes a multi-agent graph-enhanced framework for Knowledge Tracing, improving KC-relation accuracy and next-question prediction by leveraging multi-view heterogeneous graphs and avoiding attention diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based KT methods inadequately explore inter-concept relations and face challenges like computational cost and noise-proneness due to full-graph encoding.

Method: MAGE-KT constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph using a multi-agent KC relation extractor and student-question interaction graph. It retrieves high-value subgraphs and integrates them with an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module.

Result: Experiments on three KT datasets show significant improvements in KC-relation accuracy and next-question prediction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MAGE-KT effectively addresses limitations of previous KT methods, offering enhanced performance through optimized graph utilization and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model a student's learning trajectory and predict performance on the next question. A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods.

### [115] [Preventing the Collapse of Peer Review Requires Verification-First AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16909)
*Lei You,Lele Cao,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for AI-assisted peer review to prioritize verification over mimicking human reviews, introducing 'truth-coupling' as the key metric. It identifies factors leading to unreliable evaluations and suggests AI's role should be adversarial auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and pitfalls in peer review systems, particularly the shift from truth-seeking to proxy optimization.

Method: Formalizes concepts like verification pressure and signal shrinkage, using a minimal model to derive coupling laws and incentive-collapse conditions.

Result: Identifies conditions where rational effort shifts away from truth-seeking, despite reliable decisions.

Conclusion: Recommends AI tools focus on adversarial auditing and expanding verification bandwidth to counter claim inflation.

Abstract: This paper argues that AI-assisted peer review should be verification-first rather than review-mimicking. We propose truth-coupling, i.e. how tightly venue scores track latent scientific truth, as the right objective for review tools. We formalize two forces that drive a phase transition toward proxy-sovereign evaluation: verification pressure, when claims outpace verification capacity, and signal shrinkage, when real improvements become hard to separate from noise. In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable. These results motivate actions for tool builders and program chairs: deploy AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands effective verification bandwidth, rather than as a score predictor that amplifies claim inflation.

### [116] [Spatial-Agent: Agentic Geo-spatial Reasoning with Scientific Core Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16965)
*Riyang Bao,Cheng Yang,Dazhou Yu,Zhexiang Tang,Gengchen Mai,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spatial-Agent is an AI agent grounded in spatial information science, outperforming existing baselines in geospatial computation by parsing questions into executable workflows called GeoFlow Graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial reasoning is crucial for applications like urban analytics and disaster response, but current LLM-based agents often hallucinate spatial relationships instead of genuine computation.

Method: The approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as concept transformation, parsing questions into GeoFlow Graphs (DAGs with spatial concepts and transformations). It uses spatial information theory to extract concepts, assign roles, and compose transformations.

Result: Experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks show Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms baselines like ReAct and Reflexion, producing interpretable workflows.

Conclusion: Spatial-Agent advances geospatial computation by grounding workflows in spatial theory, offering both high performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Geospatial reasoning is essential for real-world applications such as urban analytics, transportation planning, and disaster response. However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.

TL;DR: An AI-powered platform aids biomedical technicians in LMICs by providing real-time troubleshooting for medical devices, reducing downtime and improving healthcare delivery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address underutilization and non-functionality of medical equipment in LMICs due to maintenance challenges, aiming to enhance patient care.

Method: Developed an AI system integrating LLM with a web interface for error code interpretation and corrective action suggestions, validated using Philips HDI 5000.

Result: Achieved 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in corrective actions.

Conclusion: AI-driven systems show promise for improving medical device maintenance in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.

*Vy Vo,He Zhao,Trung Le,Edwin V. Bonilla,Dinh Phung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends score matching for causal discovery to discrete data, introducing a new leaf discriminant criterion to improve DAG structure learning from observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning DAG structures from observational data is challenging, especially for discrete data. Current methods leverage score matching but are limited to continuous data.

Method: Extends the score matching framework to discrete data and introduces a novel leaf discriminant criterion for topological order identification.

Result: Simulated and real-world experiments show accurate inference of causal orders and improved performance of existing causal discovery baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances causal discovery for discrete data, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements across various settings.

Abstract: Learning DAG structures from purely observational data remains a long-standing challenge across scientific domains. An emerging line of research leverages the score of the data distribution to initially identify a topological order of the underlying DAG via leaf node detection and subsequently performs edge pruning for graph recovery. This paper extends the score matching framework for causal discovery, which is originally designated for continuous data, and introduces a novel leaf discriminant criterion based on the discrete score function. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our theory enables accurate inference of true causal orders from observed discrete data and the identified ordering can significantly boost the accuracy of existing causal discovery baselines on nearly all of the settings.

TL;DR: Wearable tech like Fitbit shows promise for detecting college students' mental health issues (anxiety, depression, stress) using heart rate and sleep data, achieving F1 scores up to 0.79.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: College students face high stress and mental health issues; wearables offer unobtrusive monitoring for early detection.

Method: Collected StudentMEH Fitbit dataset during the pandemic, assessed predictive ML models using various Fitbit modalities (heart rate, sleep).

Result: Achieved F1 scores of 0.79 for anxiety, 0.77 for stress, and 0.78 for depression using physiological data.

Conclusion: Wearables hold potential for continuous mental health monitoring, emphasizing the need for optimal data aggregation and modality selection.

Abstract: College students experience many stressors, resulting in high levels of anxiety and depression. Wearable technology provides unobtrusive sensor data that can be used for the early detection of mental illness. However, current research is limited concerning the variety of psychological instruments administered, physiological modalities, and time series parameters. In this research, we collect the Student Mental and Environmental Health (StudentMEH) Fitbit dataset from students at our institution during the pandemic. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the ability of predictive machine learning models to screen for depression, anxiety, and stress using different Fitbit modalities. Our findings indicate potential in physiological modalities such as heart rate and sleep to screen for mental illness with the F1 scores as high as 0.79 for anxiety, the former modality reaching 0.77 for stress screening, and the latter modality achieving 0.78 for depression. This research highlights the potential of wearable devices to support continuous mental health monitoring, the importance of identifying best data aggregation levels and appropriate modalities for screening for different mental ailments.

*Felipe Tobar,Elsa Cazelles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training GPs with projected likelihood (PL) improves accuracy and efficiency over exact GP training and sparse GPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Gaussian Process (GP) training by reducing computational complexity and maintaining accuracy.

Method: Introduces a projected likelihood (PL) objective using lower-dimensional linear projections and evaluates it with random projections on the unit sphere.

Result: PL shows superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to exact GP training and variational free energy approaches.

Conclusion: Projected likelihood is a promising objective for GP training, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a novel training objective for GPs constructed using lower-dimensional linear projections of the data, referred to as \emph{projected likelihood} (PL). We provide a closed-form expression for the information loss related to the PL and empirically show that it can be reduced with random projections on the unit sphere. We show the superiority of the PL, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, over the exact GP training and the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs over different optimisers, kernels and datasets of moderately large sizes.

### [121] [Analyzing Neural Network Information Flow Using Differential Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16366)
*Shuhang Tan,Jayson Sia,Paul Bogdan,Radoslav Ivanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph theory-based method using Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) to identify critical connections in neural networks (NNs), demonstrating its effectiveness in pruning experiments across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a novel approach for analyzing NN data flow by identifying important connections using graph curvature, aiding tasks like robustness analysis and model repair.

Method: 1) Constructs an NN-induced graph and defines neural curvature (NC) using ORC. 2) Calculates curvatures via activation patterns. 3) Evaluates NC's ability to rank edge importance through pruning experiments.

Result: Pruning negative-ORC edges significantly degrades NN performance, while positive-ORC edges have minimal impact. The method outperforms state-of-the-art pruning techniques in identifying unimportant edges.

Conclusion: The proposed NC-based method effectively identifies critical NN connections, offering a promising tool for symbolic NN analysis and pruning.

Abstract: This paper provides a fresh view of the neural network (NN) data flow problem, i.e., identifying the NN connections that are most important for the performance of the full model, through the lens of graph theory. Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods.

### [122] [A Regularized Actor-Critic Algorithm for Bi-Level Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16399)
*Sihan Zeng,Sujay Bhatt,Sumitra Ganesh,Alec Koppel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm is proposed for structured bi-level optimization in MDPs, using penalty-based reformulation and entropy regularization for efficient convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in existing bi-level optimization and RL methods, such as reliance on second-order information or nested-loop procedures, by developing a more efficient algorithm.

Method: Introduces a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm with penalty-based reformulation and attenuating entropy regularization in the lower-level RL objective.

Result: Demonstrates convergence to a stationary point of the unregularized bi-level problem, validated by experiments on GridWorld and RLHF tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a practical and efficient solution for structured bi-level optimization in MDPs, with theoretical and experimental support.

Abstract: We study a structured bi-level optimization problem where the upper-level objective is a smooth function and the lower-level problem is policy optimization in a Markov decision process (MDP). The upper-level decision variable parameterizes the reward of the lower-level MDP, and the upper-level objective depends on the optimal induced policy. Existing methods for bi-level optimization and RL often require second-order information, impose strong regularization at the lower level, or inefficiently use samples through nested-loop procedures. In this work, we propose a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm that optimizes the bi-level objective via a penalty-based reformulation. We introduce into the lower-level RL objective an attenuating entropy regularization, which enables asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level optimization problem through a novel lower-level residual analysis under a special type of Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. We validate the performance of our method through experiments on a GridWorld goal position problem and on happy tweet generation through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

*Zhaochun Li,Mingyang Yi,Yue Wang,Shisheng Cui,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the theoretical generalization properties of RLHF in aligning LLMs with human intent, proving a generalization bound under a feature coverage condition using algorithmic stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the theoretical generalization of RLHF methods in high-dimensional settings, filling a gap despite their empirical success.

Method: The authors use algorithmic stability under a linear reward model and analyze end-to-end learning frameworks, focusing on feature coverage and gradient-based algorithms like GA and SGA.

Result: They prove a generalization bound of order O(n^(-1/2)) for empirical optima of the policy model under feature coverage, applicable to gradient-based algorithms.

Conclusion: Conclusions suggest their findings provide theoretical support for the observed empirical generalization of LLMs post-RLHF.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have emerged as the dominant approaches for aligning Large Language Models with human intent. While empirically effective, the theoretical generalization properties of these methods in high-dimensional settings remain to be explored. To this end, we build the generalization theory on RLHF of LLMs under the linear reward model, through the framework of algorithmic stability. In contrast to the existing works built upon the consistency of maximum likelihood estimations on reward model, our analysis is presented under an end-to-end learning framework, which is consistent with practice. Concretely, we prove that under a key \textbf{feature coverage} condition, the empirical optima of policy model have a generalization bound of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-\frac{1}{2}})$. Moreover, the results can be extrapolated to parameters obtained by gradient-based learning algorithms, i.e., Gradient Ascent (GA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Thus, we argue that our results provide new theoretical evidence for the empirically observed generalization of LLMs after RLHF.

*Vitaly Bulgakov,Alexander Turchin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LPCORP is a two-stage framework combining reasoning-enhanced prediction and confidence-based correction to address extreme class imbalance in rare-event prediction, improving precision and reducing operational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare-event prediction suffers from extreme class imbalance, biasing conventional models toward majority-class predictions and limiting recall, calibration, and usefulness.

Method: LPCORP uses a reasoning model for enriched predictions and a logistic-regression classifier to correct biases, without resampling.

Result: The method transforms imbalanced settings into balanced ones, improving precision and reducing rare-event damage costs by over 50% in some cases.

Conclusion: LPCORP effectively mitigates prevalence-driven bias in rare-event prediction, enhancing performance and cost efficiency.

Abstract: Rare-event prediction is critical in domains such as healthcare, finance, reliability engineering, customer support, aviation safety, where positive outcomes are infrequent yet potentially catastrophic. Extreme class imbalance biases conventional models toward majority-class predictions, limiting recall, calibration, and operational usefulness. We propose LPCORP (Low-Prevalence CORrector for Prediction)*, a two-stage framework that combines reasoningenhanced prediction with confidence-based outcome correction. A reasoning model first produces enriched predictions from narrative inputs, after which a lightweight logistic-regression classifier evaluates and selectively corrects these outputs to mitigate prevalence-driven bias. We evaluate LPCORP on real-world datasets from medical and consumer service domains. The results show that this method transforms a highly imbalanced setting into a well-balanced one while preserving the original number of samples and without applying any resampling strategies. Test-set evaluation demonstrates substantially improved performance, particularly in precision, which is a known weakness in low-prevalence data. We further provide a costreduction analysis comparing the expenses associated with rare-event damage control without preventive measures to those incurred when low-cost, prediction-based preventive interventions are applied that showed more than 50% reduction in some cases. * Patent pending: U.S. Provisional 63/933,518, filed 8 December 2025.

TL;DR: The paper revisits the probabilistic component of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis theorem, replacing Hoeffding's inequality with a normal approximation to sharpen deviation estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine the probabilistic analysis of the VC theorem, improving the rate of uniform convergence estimates.

Method: Uses normal approximation with explicit Berry-Esseen error control instead of Hoeffding's inequality.

Result: Achieves a moderate-deviation sharpening, introducing an additional factor of (ε√n)^-1 in the leading exponential term when ε√n is large.

Conclusion: The refined approach offers improved deviation estimates for uniform convergence in the VC framework.

Abstract: Vapnik--Chervonenkis' theorem is a seminal result in machine learning. It establishes sufficient conditions for empirical probabilities to converge to theoretical probabilities, uniformly over families of events. It also provides an estimate for the rate of such uniform convergence.
  We revisit the probabilistic component of the classical argument. Instead of applying Hoeffding's inequality at the final step, we use a normal approximation with explicit Berry--Esseen error control. This yields a moderate-deviation sharpening of the usual VC estimate, with an additional factor of order $(\varepsilon\sqrt{n})^{-1}$ in the leading exponential term when $\varepsilon\sqrt{n}$ is large.

### [127] [Bayesian Experimental Design for Model Discrepancy Calibration: A Rivalry between Kullback--Leibler Divergence and Wasserstein Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16425)
*Huchen Yang,Xinghao Dong,Jin-Long Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares KL divergence and Wasserstein distance as utility functions in Bayesian experimental design (BED), highlighting their trade-offs and practical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the long-standing challenge of selecting utility functions in BED, focusing on the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein distance.

Method: Uses a toy example to illustrate issues with Wasserstein distance and conducts a systematic comparison through a classical source inversion problem in BED.

Result: KL divergence leads to faster convergence without model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics offer robustness with significant model discrepancy.

Conclusion: The findings clarify trade-offs and provide practical guidelines for choosing between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics in BED applications.

Abstract: Designing experiments that systematically gather data from complex physical systems is central to accelerating scientific discovery. While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications.

### [128] [Safe Multitask Molecular Graph Networks for Vapor Pressure and Odor Threshold Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16426)
*Shuang Wu,Meijie Wang,Lun Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates odor-related property modeling (VP and OP), evaluates OOD capability with scaffold splits, compares molecular graph features (A20/E17) and backbones (GINE, PNA), and introduces a safe multitask approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve modeling of vapor pressure (VP) and odor threshold (OP) properties by evaluating out-of-distribution capabilities and comparing feature-rich molecular graphs and backbone architectures.

Method: Uses Bemis-Murcko scaffold split for OOD evaluation, introduces A20/E17 molecular graph features, compares GINE and PNA backbones, and proposes a safe multitask approach (VP primary, OP auxiliary).

Result: PNA achieves Val MSE ≈ 0.21 for VP; A20/E17 with robust training achieves Val MSE ≈ 0.60-0.61 for OP. Safe multitask avoids harming VP while improving generalization.

Conclusion: The study provides reproducible results, ablation studies, and error analysis, highlighting the impact of data noise and method limitations.

Abstract: We investigate two important tasks in odor-related property modeling: Vapor Pressure (VP) and Odor Threshold (OP). To evaluate the model's out-of-distribution (OOD) capability, we adopt the Bemis-Murcko scaffold split. In terms of features, we introduce the rich A20/E17 molecular graph features (20-dimensional atom features + 17-dimensional bond features) and systematically compare GINE and PNA backbones. The results show: for VP, PNA with a simple regression head achieves Val MSE $\approx$ 0.21 (normalized space); for the OP single task under the same scaffold split, using A20/E17 with robust training (Huber/winsor) achieves Val MSE $\approx$ 0.60-0.61. For multitask training, we propose a **"safe multitask"** approach: VP as the primary task and OP as the auxiliary task, using delayed activation + gradient clipping + small weight, which avoids harming the primary task and simultaneously yields the best VP generalization performance. This paper provides complete reproducible experiments, ablation studies, and error-similarity analysis while discussing the impact of data noise and method limitations.

*Kanishk Gandhi,Shivam Garg,Noah D. Goodman,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Endless Terminals is an autonomous pipeline generating diverse terminal tasks for RL training, showing significant performance gains for models like Llama-3.2-3B and Qwen variants without complex agentic scaffolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current terminal benchmarks lack scalability for training RL agents, necessitating a fully autonomous pipeline to generate diverse tasks.

Method: The pipeline involves generating task descriptions, building containerized environments, creating completion tests, and filtering solvable tasks.

Result: Trained agents improved significantly (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B from 10.7% to 53.3%) and transferred gains to human-curated benchmarks.

Conclusion: Simple RL succeeds with scalable environments, outperforming complex approaches.

Abstract: Environments are the bottleneck for self-improving agents. Current terminal benchmarks were built for evaluation, not training; reinforcement learning requires a scalable pipeline, not just a dataset. We introduce Endless Terminals, a fully autonomous pipeline that procedurally generates terminal-use tasks without human annotation. The pipeline has four stages: generating diverse task descriptions, building and validating containerized environments, producing completion tests, and filtering for solvability. From this pipeline we obtain 3255 tasks spanning file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database operations. We train agents using vanilla PPO with binary episode level rewards and a minimal interaction loop: no retrieval, multi-agent coordination, or specialized tools. Despite this simplicity, models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains: on our held-out dev set, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 4.0% to 18.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 10.7% to 53.3%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 42.6% to 59.0%. These improvements transfer to human-curated benchmarks: models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains on held out human curated benchmarks: on TerminalBench 2.0, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 0.0% to 2.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 2.2% to 3.4%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 1.1% to 6.7%, in each case outperforming alternative approaches including models with more complex agentic scaffolds. These results demonstrate that simple RL succeeds when environments scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BrownianReLU, a stochastic activation function inspired by Brownian motion, improves gradient stability in LSTMs for noisy financial time series, outperforming traditional activations like ReLU in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional activation functions (e.g., ReLU) struggle with gradient instability in noisy, non-stationary financial data, prompting the development of BrownianReLU for better performance.

Method: BrownianReLU integrates Brownian motion to ensure smooth, adaptive responses for negative inputs. It was tested using Monte Carlo simulations and evaluated on financial datasets (Apple, GCB, S&P 500) and LendingClub loan data.

Result: BrownianReLU achieved lower Mean Squared Error and higher $R^2$ values, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization. Activation choice also impacted accuracy-sensitivity trade-offs.

Conclusion: BrownianReLU enhances LSTM performance for financial time series, addressing gradient instability and outperforming conventional activation functions.

Abstract: Deep learning models are effective for sequential data modeling, yet commonly used activation functions such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, and PReLU often exhibit gradient instability when applied to noisy, non-stationary financial time series. This study introduces BrownianReLU, a stochastic activation function induced by Brownian motion that enhances gradient propagation and learning stability in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Using Monte Carlo simulation, BrownianReLU provides a smooth, adaptive response for negative inputs, mitigating the dying ReLU problem. The proposed activation is evaluated on financial time series from Apple, GCB, and the S&P 500, as well as LendingClub loan data for classification. Results show consistently lower Mean Squared Error and higher $R^2$ values, indicating improved predictive accuracy and generalization. Although ROC-AUC metric is limited in classification tasks, activation choice significantly affects the trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity, with Brownian ReLU and the selected activation functions yielding practically meaningful performance.

TL;DR: CRISPNAM-FG is an interpretable deep learning survival model combining Neural Additive Models and Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive performance and transparency for medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of interpretability in deep learning models for survival analysis, particularly in medical settings where clinician trust is critical.

Method: Uses Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, predicting Cumulative Incidence Function via Fine-Gray formulation.

Result: Validated on benchmark datasets and diabetic foot complication prediction, achieving competitive performance with transparent outputs.

Conclusion: CRISPNAM-FG balances high predictive power and interpretability, making it viable for clinical integration.

Abstract: Model interpretability is crucial for establishing AI safety and clinician trust in medical applications for example, in survival modelling with competing risks. Recent deep learning models have attained very good predictive performance but their limited transparency, being black-box models, hinders their integration into clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose an intrinsically interpretable survival model called CRISPNAM-FG. Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions. We validated the model on several benchmark datasets and applied our model to predict future foot complications in diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023). Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other deep survival models while providing transparency through shape functions and feature importance plots.

### [132] [On the Expressive Power of Floating-Point Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16450)
*Sejun Park,Yeachan Park,Geonho Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the representability of transformers under floating-point operations, revealing deviations from exact-operation theories, including non-equivariant capabilities and limitations with long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how floating-point approximations affect transformers' theoretical properties, especially permutation equivariance.

Method: Analyze transformers using floating-point parameters and operations, focusing on representability and equivariance under bounded and unbounded sequence lengths.

Result: Floating-point transformers can represent non-permutation-equivariant functions and handle bounded sequences, but fail with long sequences. Minimal equivariance structures are identified.

Conclusion: Floating-point operations introduce representational trade-offs, affecting transformers' equivariance and positional encoding effectiveness.

Abstract: The study on the expressive power of transformers shows that transformers are permutation equivariant, and they can approximate all permutation-equivariant continuous functions on a compact domain. However, these results are derived under real parameters and exact operations, while real implementations on computers can only use a finite set of numbers and inexact machine operations with round-off errors. In this work, we investigate the representability of floating-point transformers that use floating-point parameters and floating-point operations. Unlike existing results under exact operations, we first show that floating-point transformers can represent a class of non-permutation-equivariant functions even without positional encoding. Furthermore, we prove that floating-point transformers can represent all permutation-equivariant functions when the sequence length is bounded, but they cannot when the sequence length is large. We also found the minimal equivariance structure in floating-point transformers, and show that all non-trivial additive positional encoding can harm the representability of floating-point transformers.

### [133] [On the Effects of Adversarial Perturbations on Distribution Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16464)
*Yipei Wang,Zhaoying Pan,Xiaoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the tradeoff between adversarial and distribution robustness, revealing that while adversarial training can harm distribution robustness, moderate ℓ∞ perturbations on biased data may enhance it, especially when feature separability is high.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the interplay between adversarial robustness (resisting input perturbations) and distribution robustness (performance under data shifts), highlighting gaps in prior work that revealed a tradeoff between the two.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical analysis using surrogate models trained on perturbed data, focusing on ℓ∞ perturbations and their impact on feature separability and robustness.

Result: Key findings include a nuanced effect where moderate ℓ∞ perturbations on biased data can improve distribution robustness, particularly when feature separability is strong. However, adversarial training often exacerbates reliance on spurious features, harming distribution robustness.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes the importance of considering feature separability in robustness analyses, as overlooking it can lead to misleading conclusions. While the tradeoff persists, understanding its nuances is critical for reliable model performance.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness refers to a model's ability to resist perturbation of inputs, while distribution robustness evaluates the performance of the model under data shifts. Although both aim to ensure reliable performance, prior work has revealed a tradeoff in distribution and adversarial robustness. Specifically, adversarial training might increase reliance on spurious features, which can harm distribution robustness, especially the performance on some underrepresented subgroups. We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\ell_\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability. Despite the tradeoff that persists in many cases, overlooking the role of feature separability may lead to misleading conclusions about robustness.

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning (SSL) framework R-NCE outperforms traditional methods in deriving Alzheimer's disease biomarkers from structural MRI, showing biological relevance through genetic associations and cellular enrichment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover more sensitive and biologically grounded biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease using structural MRI data, overcoming limitations of hand-crafted features like cortical thickness.

Method: Introduces Residual Noise Contrastive Estimation (R-NCE), a SSL framework incorporating FreeSurfer features and maximizing augmentation-invariant information.

Result: R-NCE surpasses traditional and existing SSL methods in disease classification, conversion prediction, and amyloid status prediction, with high heritability and genetic associations.

Conclusion: R-NCE demonstrates potential for uncovering powerful biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease, with biological relevance validated through genetic and cellular analyses.

Abstract: Discovery of sensitive and biologically grounded biomarkers is essential for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structural MRI is widely available but typically relies on hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness or volume. We ask whether self-supervised learning (SSL) can uncover more powerful biomarkers from the same data. Existing SSL methods underperform FreeSurfer-derived features in disease classification, conversion prediction, and amyloid status prediction. We introduce Residual Noise Contrastive Estimation (R-NCE), a new SSL framework that integrates auxiliary FreeSurfer features while maximizing additional augmentation-invariant information. R-NCE outperforms traditional features and existing SSL methods across multiple benchmarks, including AD conversion prediction. To assess biological relevance, we derive Brain Age Gap (BAG) measures and perform genome-wide association studies. R-NCE-BAG shows high heritability and associations with MAPT and IRAG1, with enrichment in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, indicating sensitivity to neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular processes.

### [135] [Robust Categorical Data Clustering Guided by Multi-Granular Competitive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16491)
*Shenghong Cai,Yiqun Zhang,Xiaopeng Luo,Yiu-Ming Cheung,Hong Jia,Peng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses clustering challenges in categorical data by introducing MGCPL and CAME, resulting in an effective and scalable solution called MCDC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Categorical data's qualitative nature complicates clustering due to undefined distance spaces and overlapping clusters.

Method: Proposes MGCPL for interactive cluster tuning and CAME for encoding and final clustering.

Result: MCDC effectively explores nested clusters and scales well with linear complexity.

Conclusion: MCDC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness and scalability for categorical data clustering.

Abstract: Data set composed of categorical features is very common in big data analysis tasks. Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing. Extensive experiments with statistical evidence demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art counterparts on various real public data sets.

TL;DR: BoostFGL is a fairness-aware federated graph learning framework addressing performance disparities in disadvantaged node groups through client-side node and topology boosting, and server-side model boosting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGL methods often hide severe performance degradation in disadvantaged node groups behind high overall accuracy, necessitating a fairness-focused approach.

Method: BoostFGL employs client-side node boosting to emphasize underserved nodes, client-side topology boosting to optimize propagation structures, and server-side model boosting for reliable aggregation.

Result: BoostFGL achieves significant fairness improvements (8.43% Overall-F1) while maintaining competitive overall performance on 9 datasets.

Conclusion: BoostFGL effectively addresses fairness disparities in FGL without compromising overall performance, demonstrating its practical viability.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across decentralized subgraphs without exposing raw data. While existing FGL methods often achieve high overall accuracy, we show that this average performance can conceal severe degradation on disadvantaged node groups. From a fairness perspective, these disparities arise systematically from three coupled sources: label skew toward majority patterns, topology confounding in message propagation, and aggregation dilution of updates from hard clients. To address this, we propose \textbf{BoostFGL}, a boosting-style framework for fairness-aware FGL. BoostFGL introduces three coordinated mechanisms: \ding{182} \emph{Client-side node boosting}, which reshapes local training signals to emphasize systematically under-served nodes; \ding{183} \emph{Client-side topology boosting}, which reallocates propagation emphasis toward reliable yet underused structures and attenuates misleading neighborhoods; and \ding{184} \emph{Server-side model boosting}, which performs difficulty- and reliability-aware aggregation to preserve informative updates from hard clients while stabilizing the global model. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets show that BoostFGL delivers substantial fairness gains, improving Overall-F1 by 8.43\%, while preserving competitive overall performance against strong FGL baselines.

TL;DR: The abstract presents an adaptive graph model combining HNSW with a pre-computed voting mechanism to overcome kNN's computational trade-offs, achieving real-time inference speeds without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The kNN algorithm faces limitations in large-scale applications due to trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Existing solutions improve speed but harm precision and lack adaptability in choosing the optimal neighborhood size.

Method: The proposed method integrates a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, shifting neighbor selection and weighting computations to the training phase.

Result: Benchmarked against eight baselines across six datasets, the framework achieves real-time inference speeds without sacrificing classification accuracy.

Conclusion: This adaptive graph model resolves kNN's inference bottleneck, offering a scalable and robust solution for graph-based nonparametric learning.

Abstract: The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a cornerstone of non-parametric classification in artificial intelligence, yet its deployment in large-scale applications is persistently constrained by the computational trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Existing approximate nearest neighbor solutions accelerate retrieval but often degrade classification precision and lack adaptability in selecting the optimal neighborhood size (k). Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy. These findings offer a scalable, robust solution to the long-standing inference bottleneck of kNN, establishing a new structural paradigm for graph-based nonparametric learning.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a shallow Transformer's performance, showing logarithmic width scaling with sample size and independence of optimization error from sequence length, contrasting recurrent architectures. Memory grows with sequence length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand Transformers' superior performance despite non-convex optimization challenges.

Method: Analyzed a shallow Transformer with m heads trained by projected gradient descent in the kernel regime.

Result: Found logarithmic width scaling with sample size and optimization error independent of sequence length, validated numerically.

Conclusion: Transformers outperform recurrent architectures in optimization stability but require more memory for longer sequences.

Abstract: Understanding why Transformers perform so well remains challenging due to their non-convex optimization landscape. In this work, we analyze a shallow Transformer with $m$ independent heads trained by projected gradient descent in the kernel regime. Our analysis reveals two main findings: (i) the width required for nonasymptotic guarantees scales only logarithmically with the sample size $n$, and (ii) the optimization error is independent of the sequence length $T$. This contrasts sharply with recurrent architectures, where the optimization error can grow exponentially with $T$. The trade-off is memory: to keep the full context, the Transformer's memory requirement grows with the sequence length. We validate our theoretical results numerically in a teacher-student setting and confirm the predicted scaling laws for Transformers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DANCE, a new paradigm for Text-Attributed Graph Federated Learning (TAG-FGL) that addresses challenges of overhead, suboptimal performance, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TAG-FGL methods struggle with high computational costs from LLMs, suboptimal performance due to static graph condensation, and lack of interpretability.

Method: DANCE uses round-wise, model-in-the-loop graph condensation refresh and preserves interpretability by storing locally inspectable evidence packs.

Result: DANCE improves accuracy by 2.33% at an 8% condensation ratio and reduces token usage by 33.42% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: DANCE effectively tackles the challenges in TAG-FGL by balancing efficiency, adaptability, and interpretability.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables collaborative training on graph data across multiple clients. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), textual attributes in FGL graphs are gaining attention. Text-attributed graph federated learning (TAG-FGL) improves FGL by explicitly leveraging LLMs to process and integrate these textual features. However, current TAG-FGL methods face three main challenges: \textbf{(1) Overhead.} LLMs for processing long texts incur high token and computation costs. To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates. However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult. To address the above issues, we propose \textbf{DANCE}, a new TAG-FGL paradigm with GC. To improve \textbf{suboptimal} performance, DANCE performs round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh using the latest global model. To enhance \textbf{interpretability}, DANCE preserves provenance by storing locally inspectable evidence packs that trace predictions to selected neighbors and source text spans. Across 8 TAG datasets, DANCE improves accuracy by \textbf{2.33\%} at an \textbf{8\%} condensation ratio, with \textbf{33.42\%} fewer tokens than baselines.

*Xianya Fang,Feiyang Ren,Xiang Chen,Yu Tian,Zhen Bi,Haiyang Yu,Sheng-Jun Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SARE, a method to address structural fragility in multimodal LLMs' unlearning processes, ensuring robust removal of object hallucinations while preserving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs often hallucinate non-existent objects, undermining reliability. Existing unlearning methods fail to address structural fragility, leading to superficial suppression and catastrophic resurgences.

Method: Proposes SARE, a targeted min-max optimization framework using Targeted-SAM to flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts, ensuring geometric stability under perturbations.

Result: SARE outperforms baselines in erasure efficacy, maintains generation quality, and resists hallucinations against relearning and parameter updates.

Conclusion: SARE's geometric stabilization effectively addresses structural fragility in unlearning, providing persistent hallucination suppression.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are powerful but prone to object hallucinations, which describe non-existent entities and harm reliability. While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SARE significantly outperforms baselines in erasure efficacy while preserving general generation quality. Crucially, it maintains persistent hallucination suppression against relearning and parameter updates, validating the effectiveness of geometric stabilization.

### [141] [A Collision-Free Hot-Tier Extension for Engram-Style Conditional Memory: A Controlled Study of Training Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16531)
*Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension for Engram-style conditional memory, doesn't consistently improve validation loss despite isolating key collisions. Collisions may act as implicit regularization, and gating mismatch limits performance more than lookup precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if high-frequency key collisions are the primary bottleneck in Engram-style conditional memory and whether eliminating them improves performance.

Method: Introduced Engram-Nine, a two-tier system using MPHF for frequent n-grams (hot tier) and multi-head hashed lookup (cold tier), evaluated under iso-parameter conditions and route-stratified analysis.

Result: Collision-free designs don't consistently reduce validation loss. Hot-tier positions initially outperform cold-tier ones but later lag, with collisions delaying this flip. Gating mismatch persists, favoring hot positions even when they underperform.

Conclusion: Lookup precision improvements alone aren't sufficient; gating credit assignment is a bigger limitation. Collision-induced noise may benefit training as implicit regularization.

Abstract: We investigate whether high-frequency key collisions are a primary bottleneck in Engram-style conditional memory. To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.
  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent "hot-to-cold advantage flip" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.
  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated.

*Xiaobin Li,Run Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JORC-UMAP improves UMAP by addressing its sensitivity to k-nearest neighbor graphs using Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Jaccard similarity, reducing topological tearing and structural collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMAP's reliance on local Euclidean distance often fails to capture true manifold geometry, causing tearing and collapse.

Method: Introduces Ollivier-Ricci curvature to reinforce edges at bottlenecks and Jaccard similarity for neighborhood consistency.

Result: JORC-UMAP outperforms standard UMAP in reducing tearing and collapse, verified by SVM accuracy and triplet preservation scores.

Conclusion: JORC-UMAP enhances UMAP for more accurate high-dimensional data visualization while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly UMAP, are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data. However, UMAP's local Euclidean distance assumption often fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to topological tearing and structural collapse. We identify UMAP's sensitivity to the k-nearest neighbor graph as a key cause. To address this, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior, reinforcing edges at geometric bottlenecks and reducing redundant links. Since curvature estimation is noise-sensitive, we also incorporate a topological prior using Jaccard similarity to ensure neighborhood consistency. The resulting method, JORC-UMAP, better distinguishes true manifold structure from spurious connections. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that JORC-UMAP reduces tearing and collapse more effectively than standard UMAP and other DR methods, as measured by SVM accuracy and triplet preservation scores, while maintaining computational efficiency. This work offers a geometry-aware enhancement to UMAP for more faithful data visualization.

### [143] [Predicting Startup Success Using Large Language Models: A Novel In-Context Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16568)
*Abdurahman Maarouf,Alket Bakiaj,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using LLMs and a novel kNN-ICL framework, the paper improves early-stage startup success prediction with minimal labeled data, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting early-stage startup success is hard due to limited data, making traditional ML ineffective. The paper aims to address this using in-context learning.

Method: Proposes kNN-ICL, a framework combining k-nearest-neighbor with in-context learning, using minimal labeled startup examples for predictions.

Result: kNN-ICL outperforms supervised ML and vanilla in-context learning, achieving high accuracy with as few as 50 labeled examples.

Conclusion: In-context learning is viable for VC firms facing data scarcity, offering an effective decision-making tool.

Abstract: Venture capital (VC) investments in early-stage startups that end up being successful can yield high returns. However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A public dataset combining Finnish railway operations with synchronized weather data (2018-2024) is introduced, featuring 28 engineered features and 38.5M observations. It supports delay prediction and weather impact analysis, with XGBoost achieving a 2.73-minute MAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack integrated meteorological and operational train data, especially in Nordic regions. This study fills that gap to improve railway reliability analysis.

Method: The dataset integrates Finnish railway data with weather measurements using spatial-temporal alignment. Preprocessing includes missing data handling, cyclical encoding, and robust scaling.

Result: Seasonal patterns show winter delays exceeding 25%, with high-delay clusters in central/northern Finland. XGBoost achieved a 2.73-minute MAE for delay prediction.

Conclusion: The dataset is a valuable resource for machine learning in railway operations, enabling delay prediction, weather impact assessment, and infrastructure analysis.

Abstract: Train delays result from complex interactions between operational, technical, and environmental factors. While weather impacts railway reliability, particularly in Nordic regions, existing datasets rarely integrate meteorological information with operational train data. This study presents the first publicly available dataset combining Finnish railway operations with synchronized meteorological observations from 2018-2024. The dataset integrates operational metrics from Finland Digitraffic Railway Traffic Service with weather measurements from 209 environmental monitoring stations, using spatial-temporal alignment via Haversine distance. It encompasses 28 engineered features across operational variables and meteorological measurements, covering approximately 38.5 million observations from Finland's 5,915-kilometer rail network. Preprocessing includes strategic missing data handling through spatial fallback algorithms, cyclical encoding of temporal features, and robust scaling of weather data to address sensor outliers. Analysis reveals distinct seasonal patterns, with winter months exhibiting delay rates exceeding 25\% and geographic clustering of high-delay corridors in central and northern Finland. Furthermore, the work demonstrates applications of the data set in analysing the reliability of railway traffic in Finland. A baseline experiment using XGBoost regression achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 2.73 minutes for predicting station-specific delays, demonstrating the dataset's utility for machine learning applications. The dataset enables diverse applications, including train delay prediction, weather impact assessment, and infrastructure vulnerability mapping, providing researchers with a flexible resource for machine learning applications in railway operations research.

TL;DR: E2Former-V2 improves scalability of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks by introducing algebraic sparsity and hardware-aware execution, achieving 20x speedup without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream EGNNs face scalability issues due to explicit geometric feature construction or dense tensor products on every edge.

Method: Introduces Equivariant Axis-Aligned Sparsification (EAAS) and On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention implemented via a custom Triton kernel.

Result: Achieves a 20x improvement in TFLOPS and maintains comparable predictive performance on SPICE and OMol25 datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates efficient training of large equivariant transformers on widely accessible GPU platforms.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have become a widely used approach for modeling 3D atomistic systems. However, mainstream architectures face critical scalability bottlenecks due to the explicit construction of geometric features or dense tensor products on \textit{every} edge. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{E2Former-V2}, a scalable architecture that integrates algebraic sparsity with hardware-aware execution. We first propose \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{A}xis-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{S}parsification (EAAS). EAAS builds on Wigner-$6j$ convolution by exploiting an $\mathrm{SO}(3) \rightarrow \mathrm{SO}(2)$ change of basis to transform computationally expensive dense tensor contractions into efficient, sparse parity re-indexing operations. Building on this representation, we introduce \textbf{On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention}, a fully node-centric mechanism implemented via a custom fused Triton kernel. By eliminating materialized edge tensors and maximizing SRAM utilization, our kernel achieves a \textbf{20$\times$ improvement in TFLOPS} compared to standard implementations. Extensive experiments on the SPICE and OMol25 datasets demonstrate that E2Former-V2 maintains comparable predictive performance while notably accelerating inference. This work demonstrates that large equivariant transformers can be trained efficiently using widely accessible GPU platforms.

*Haonan Yang,Jianchao Tang,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DPAD, a model-agnostic framework for time series forecasting that dynamically disentangles temporal patterns and enhances context-aware adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting methods often learn static, averaged representations, failing to leverage complex temporal patterns dynamically. DPAD addresses this by disentangling and adapting patterns contextually.

Method: DPAD uses a Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework with a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP) for common and rare patterns, a Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism, and a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss).

Result: DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances forecasting models by dynamically disentangling and leveraging temporal patterns.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has witnessed significant progress with deep learning. While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.

*Jamie Duell,Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probabilistically Safe CEs (PSCE) generates counterfactual explanations with formal guarantees of safety ($δ$-safe) and robustness ($ε$-robust) under model updates, outperforming existing Bayesian CE methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanations become unreliable when models are updated frequently. PSCE aims to provide reliable and robust explanations under such dynamic conditions.

Method: PSCE integrates Bayesian principles and uncertainty-aware constraints into an optimization framework to generate $δ$-safe and $ε$-robust counterfactual explanations (CEs).

Result: Empirical validation shows PSCE produces more plausible, discriminative, and provably robust CEs compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian CE methods.

Conclusion: PSCE advances the reliability of counterfactual explanations in dynamic real-world settings where models are frequently updated.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) offer interpretable insights into machine learning predictions by answering ``what if?" questions. However, in real-world settings where models are frequently updated, existing counterfactual explanations can quickly become invalid or unreliable. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistically Safe CEs (PSCE), a method for generating counterfactual explanations that are $δ$-safe, to ensure high predictive confidence, and $ε$-robust to ensure low predictive variance. Based on Bayesian principles, PSCE provides formal probabilistic guarantees for CEs under model changes which are adhered to in what we refer to as the $\langle δ, ε\rangle$-set. Uncertainty-aware constraints are integrated into our optimization framework and we validate our method empirically across diverse datasets. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art Bayesian CE methods, where PSCE produces counterfactual explanations that are not only more plausible and discriminative, but also provably robust under model change.

*Adrick Tench,Thomas Demeester*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flexible ensemble method for causal discovery in healthcare, incorporating dynamically requested expert knowledge to address challenges like noisy data and algorithm assumptions. It evaluates imperfect experts like LLMs and provides practical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate causal models are vital in healthcare for interpretability, counterfactual reasoning, and treatment effect estimation. However, choosing among many causal discovery algorithms is challenging, and real-world scenarios often violate algorithm assumptions, necessitating expert knowledge.

Method: The authors propose a model averaging method that dynamically requests expert knowledge from sources like LLMs to ensemble diverse causal discovery algorithms. This approach aims to handle noisy data and violated assumptions.

Result: Experiments show the method's effectiveness with imperfect experts (e.g., LLMs) on clean and noisy data. The study also examines expert correctness levels and LLMs' potential in clinical causal discovery.

Conclusion: The flexible ensemble method, aided by expert knowledge, improves causal discovery robustness in healthcare. Insights on LLMs' role and expert correctness provide guidance for practitioners.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships is critical for healthcare. Accurate causal models provide a means to enhance the interpretability of predictive models, and furthermore a basis for counterfactual and interventional reasoning and the estimation of treatment effects. However, would-be practitioners of causal discovery face a dizzying array of algorithms without a clear best choice. This abundance of competitive algorithms makes ensembling a natural choice for practical applications. At the same time, real-world use cases frequently face challenges that violate the assumptions of common causal discovery algorithms, forcing heavy reliance on expert knowledge. Inspired by recent work on dynamically requested expert knowledge and LLMs as experts, we present a flexible model averaging method leveraging dynamically requested expert knowledge to ensemble a diverse array of causal discovery algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method with imperfect experts such as LLMs on both clean and noisy data. We also analyze the impact of different degrees of expert correctness and assess the capabilities of LLMs for clinical causal discovery, providing valuable insights for practitioners.

TL;DR: A sequential penalty method is proposed to handle strict constraints in learning tasks, with convergence guarantees and practical viability demonstrated in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize strict constraints in learning tasks rather than relying on arbitrary penalties.

Method: Sequential penalty method that properly deals with constraints.

Result: Convergence guarantees under reasonable assumptions and successful application in image processing tasks.

Conclusion: The method is viable for practical use in deep learning scenarios.

Abstract: In many learning tasks, certain requirements on the processing of individual data samples should arguably be formalized as strict constraints in the underlying optimization problem, rather than by means of arbitrary penalties. We show that, in these scenarios, learning can be carried out exploiting a sequential penalty method that allows to properly deal with constraints. The proposed algorithm is shown to possess convergence guarantees under assumptions that are reasonable in deep learning scenarios. Moreover, the results of experiments on image processing tasks show that the method is indeed viable to be used in practice.

*Robin Young,Srinivasan Keshav*

TL;DR: The paper introduces Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs) for reliable biomass mapping with GEDI mission data, addressing the limitations of traditional machine learning methods in handling spatial heterogeneity and uncertainty calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like Random Forest and XGBoost fail to account for spatial context and produce unreliable uncertainty estimates in heterogeneous landscapes.

Method: The authors propose ANPs, a probabilistic meta-learning framework that leverages local observation sets and geospatial embeddings to adapt predictions spatially.

Result: ANPs achieve competitive accuracy and maintain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates across diverse biomes, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: ANPs offer a scalable and theoretically robust solution for mapping biomass at continental scales, with strong performance in few-shot adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable wall-to-wall biomass mapping from NASA's GEDI mission requires interpolating sparse LiDAR observations across heterogeneous landscapes. While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.
  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data. This work provides a scalable, theoretically rigorous alternative to ensemble variance for continental scale earth observation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To show how human expertise can enhance LLM-generated solutions in theoretical computer science, addressing long-standing open problems.

Method: Using FunSearch algorithm outputs, iteratively refining them with human oversight to derive adversarial instances for heuristics.

Result: Improved constructions for hierarchical $k$-median clustering, bin packing, knapsack, and Lovász's gasoline problem, breaking decade-old barriers.

Conclusion: LLMs are powerful collaborative tools when combined with human expertise, enabling rigorous and insightful mathematical constructions.

Abstract: We demonstrate the power of human-LLM collaboration in tackling open problems in theoretical computer science. Focusing on combinatorial optimization, we refine outputs from the FunSearch algorithm [Romera-Paredes et al., Nature 2023] to derive state-of-the-art lower bounds for standard heuristics. Specifically, we target the generation of adversarial instances where these heuristics perform poorly. By iterating on FunSearch's outputs, we identify improved constructions for hierarchical $k$-median clustering, bin packing, the knapsack problem, and a generalization of Lovász's gasoline problem - some of these have not seen much improvement for over a decade, despite intermittent attention. These results illustrate how expert oversight can effectively extrapolate algorithmic insights from LLM-based evolutionary methods to break long-standing barriers.
  Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs provide critical initial patterns, human expertise is essential for transforming these patterns into mathematically rigorous and insightful constructions. This work highlights that LLMs are a strong collaborative tool in mathematics and computer science research.

TL;DR: The paper studies learning Transformer-based models using black-box access to outputs. It presents algorithms for learning single-head attention models efficiently and explores limitations in multi-head attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how Transformer-based models can be learned efficiently using only black-box access to their outputs, focusing on single-head and multi-head attention scenarios.

Method: The authors propose algorithms for learning single-head attention models with exact parameter recovery using quadratic queries. They also explore learning with compressed sensing for lower-dimensional heads and study robustness to noise.

Result: For single-head attention, exact learning is achievable with quadratic queries, while compressed sensing reduces query complexity for low-dimensional heads. Multi-head attention lacks identifiability guarantees.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates efficient learning for single-head attention but highlights fundamental limitations in multi-head settings, suggesting structural assumptions are needed for further advances.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Transformer-based sequence models with black-box access to their outputs. In this setting, a learner may adaptively query the oracle with any sequence of vectors and observe the corresponding real-valued output. We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance. Finally, we show that multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries in general -- distinct parameterisations can induce the same input-output map. Hence, guarantees analogous to the single-head setting are impossible without additional structural assumptions.

TL;DR: The paper derives exact formulae for minimal weight perturbations in DNNs to achieve output changes, compares these with multi-layer guarantees, and applies them to backdoor attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the minimal perturbations needed for output changes in DNNs and assess their robustness.

Method: Derives single-layer exact formulae and contrasts them with multi-layer Lipschitz-based guarantees.

Result: Both methods yield similar efficacy. Applied results show provable thresholds for backdoor attacks and reliable low-rank compression.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into layer-wise sensitivity and certifiable guarantees for parameter updates.

Abstract: The minimal norm weight perturbations of DNNs required to achieve a specified change in output are derived and the factors determining its size are discussed. These single-layer exact formulae are contrasted with more generic multi-layer Lipschitz constant based robustness guarantees; both are observed to be of the same order which indicates similar efficacy in their guarantees. These results are applied to precision-modification-activated backdoor attacks, establishing provable compression thresholds below which such attacks cannot succeed, and show empirically that low-rank compression can reliably activate latent backdoors while preserving full-precision accuracy. These expressions reveal how back-propagated margins govern layer-wise sensitivity and provide certifiable guarantees on the smallest parameter updates consistent with a desired output shift.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGDL trains deep neural networks grade by grade, freezing previous grades and refining residuals to ensure stability and interpretability, with theoretical guarantees for vanishing approximation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep neural networks is challenging due to non-convex optimization landscapes. Shallow networks, like one-hidden-layer ReLU models, offer convex training with global guarantees, inspiring a structured approach to scaling depth.

Method: MGDL trains deep networks hierarchically, freezing learned grades and training new residual blocks to reduce remaining error. This is supported by an operator-theoretic foundation.

Result: Theoretical proof shows that MGDL with fixed-width ReLU schemes ensures strictly decreasing residuals and uniform convergence to zero for any continuous target function. Numerical experiments validate the findings.

Conclusion: MGDL provides a stable, interpretable, and theoretically guaranteed framework for training deep networks by progressive error refinement.

Abstract: We study multigrade deep learning (MGDL) as a principled framework for structured error refinement in deep neural networks. While the approximation power of neural networks is now relatively well understood, training very deep architectures remains challenging due to highly non-convex and often ill-conditioned optimization landscapes. In contrast, for relatively shallow networks, most notably one-hidden-layer $\texttt{ReLU}$ models, training admits convex reformulations with global guarantees, motivating learning paradigms that improve stability while scaling to depth. MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process. We develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL and prove that, for any continuous target function, there exists a fixed-width multigrade $\texttt{ReLU}$ scheme whose residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantee that grade-wise training yields provable vanishing approximation error in deep networks. Numerical experiments further illustrate the theoretical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSGM is a unified framework for federated constrained optimization, addressing key FL challenges like functional constraints, communication bottlenecks, local updates, and partial client participation. It uses projection-free primal-only updates and bi-directional error feedback for efficient convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle major challenges in federated learning, such as handling functional constraints, optimizing communication, managing local updates, and dealing with partial client participation, within a single framework.

Method: FedSGM employs the switching gradient method, offering projection-free, primal-only updates. It includes bi-directional error feedback to manage communication limits and compression noise.

Result: The framework achieves a canonical $oldsymbol{\mathcal{O}}(1/√T)$ convergence rate, with high-probability bounds decoupling optimization progress from sampling noise. A soft switching version stabilizes updates near feasibility boundaries.

Conclusion: FedSGM is the first unified framework addressing functional constraints, compression, multiple local updates, and partial client participation in FL. Experimental validation on tasks like Neyman-Pearson classification and CMDP confirms its theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We introduce FedSGM, a unified framework for federated constrained optimization that addresses four major challenges in federated learning (FL): functional constraints, communication bottlenecks, local updates, and partial client participation. Building on the switching gradient method, FedSGM provides projection-free, primal-only updates, avoiding expensive dual-variable tuning or inner solvers. To handle communication limits, FedSGM incorporates bi-directional error feedback, correcting the bias introduced by compression while explicitly understanding the interaction between compression noise and multi-step local updates. We derive convergence guarantees showing that the averaged iterate achieves the canonical $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, with additional high-probability bounds that decouple optimization progress from sampling noise due to partial participation. Additionally, we introduce a soft switching version of FedSGM to stabilize updates near the feasibility boundary. To our knowledge, FedSGM is the first framework to unify functional constraints, compression, multiple local updates, and partial client participation, establishing a theoretically grounded foundation for constrained federated learning. Finally, we validate the theoretical guarantees of FedSGM via experimentation on Neyman-Pearson classification and constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of satellite-based methods suitable for smallholder conditions, the study aims to improve crop type mapping for food security, livelihood support, and climate change mitigation.

Method: Four criteria (performance, plausibility, transferability, accessibility) are established to evaluate TESSERA and AlphaEarth embeddings against baseline methods in Senegal's groundnut basin.

Result: TESSERA-based approach meets the criteria best, achieving 28% higher accuracy in a temporal transfer example compared to other methods.

Conclusion: TESSERA embeddings are effective for crop type classification and mapping in Senegal, offering significant advantages over existing approaches.

Abstract: Crop type maps from satellite remote sensing are important tools for food security, local livelihood support and climate change mitigation in smallholder regions of the world, but most satellite-based methods are not well suited to smallholder conditions. To address this gap, we establish a four-part criteria for a useful embedding-based approach consisting of 1) performance, 2) plausibility, 3) transferability and 4) accessibility and evaluate geospatial foundation model (FM) embeddings -based approaches using TESSERA and AlphaEarth against current baseline methods for a region in the groundnut basin of Senegal. We find that the TESSERA -based approach to land cover and crop type mapping fulfills the selection criteria best, and in one temporal transfer example shows 28% higher accuracy compared to the next best method. These results indicate that TESSERA embeddings are an effective approach for crop type classification and mapping tasks in Senegal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods fail for MoE architectures, exploiting router vulnerabilities instead of erasing knowledge.

Method: GRIP introduces geometric constraints via null-space projection of router gradients, decoupling routing stability from parameter rigidity.

Result: GRIP achieves over 95% routing stability and preserves model utility across tested unlearning methods.

Conclusion: GRIP enables effective unlearning in MoE models by preventing router manipulation and adapting existing methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models has become critical for AI safety, yet existing methods fail to generalize to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs.

*Calarina Muslimani,Yunshu Du,Kenta Kawamoto,Kaushik Subramanian,Peter Stone,Peter Wurman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAC to improve reward function design in RL, showing it enhances performance and reduces workload, and proposes Soft-TAC for automated reward learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing accurate reward functions manually is time-consuming and error-prone. The study aims to support practitioners and automate reward learning.

Method: The authors use TAC to guide reward tuning and propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable version for training reward models from human preferences.

Result: TAC improved reward tuning effectiveness, while Soft-TAC captured distinct preferences better than standard methods in Gran Turismo 7.

Conclusion: TAC is effective for both manual tuning and automated reward learning, addressing challenges in RL reward design.

Abstract: The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.

### [160] [Calibrated Similarity for Reliable Geometric Analysis of Embedding Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16907)
*Nicolas Tacheny*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the miscalibration issue in cosine similarity scores for pretrained embeddings by introducing isotonic regression to achieve better interpretability without altering rank correlation or geometric structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cosine similarity scores in pretrained embeddings are systematically miscalibrated, limiting their interpretability despite strong rank correlation with human judgments. Existing solutions alter the embedding space, requiring recomputation.

Method: The authors use isotonic regression trained on human similarity judgments to construct a monotonic transformation that preserves rank correlation and local stability while achieving near-perfect calibration.

Result: The method achieves 98% stability across seven perturbation types and restores interpretability of cosine similarity scores without changing ranking properties.

Conclusion: Isotonic calibration is a viable solution for improving interpretability of cosine similarity scores while preserving their ranking properties, making it a practical alternative to space-altering methods.

Abstract: While raw cosine similarity in pretrained embedding spaces exhibits strong rank correlation with human judgments, anisotropy induces systematic miscalibration of absolute values: scores concentrate in a narrow high-similarity band regardless of actual semantic relatedness, limiting interpretability as a quantitative measure. Prior work addresses this by modifying the embedding space (whitening, contrastive fine tuning), but such transformations alter geometric structure and require recomputing all embeddings.
  Using isotonic regression trained on human similarity judgments, we construct a monotonic transformation that achieves near-perfect calibration while preserving rank correlation and local stability(98% across seven perturbation types). Our contribution is not to replace cosine similarity, but to restore interpretability of its absolute values through monotone calibration, without altering its ranking properties.
  We characterize isotonic calibration as an order-preserving reparameterization and prove that all order-based constructions (angular ordering, nearest neighbors, threshold graphs and quantile-based decisions) are invariant under this transformation.

*Navid Ardeshir,Samuel Deng,Daniel Hsu,Jingwen Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-group learning's sample complexity improves in the group-realizable setting compared to agnostic, even with infinite groups (finite VC dimension). Empirical risk minimization works but is computationally intractable; improper learning is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sample complexity in multi-group learning, especially focusing on the group-realizable setting.

Method: Empirical risk minimization over group-realizable concepts; suggests improper learning as an alternative due to computational intractability.

Result: Improved sample complexity in group-realizable setting, but computational hurdles remain.

Conclusion: While theoretical improvements exist, practical implementation requires alternatives like improper learning.

Abstract: The sample complexity of multi-group learning is shown to improve in the group-realizable setting over the agnostic setting, even when the family of groups is infinite so long as it has finite VC dimension. The improved sample complexity is obtained by empirical risk minimization over the class of group-realizable concepts, which itself could have infinite VC dimension. Implementing this approach is also shown to be computationally intractable, and an alternative approach is suggested based on improper learning.

*Anton Zamyatin,Patrick Indri,Sagar Malhotra,Thomas Gärtner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BatchEnsemble aims to reduce costs for uncertainty estimates but performs similarly to a single model, lacking the diversity and robustness of Deep Ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently obtaining uncertainty estimates in resource-constrained settings.

Method: BatchEnsemble applies rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network instead of training multiple full-size models.

Result: Underperforms Deep Ensembles, closely tracking a single model in accuracy, calibration, and OOD detection. Members show near-identical behavior.

Conclusion: BatchEnsemble behaves more like a single model than a true ensemble, failing to provide robust epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: In resource-constrained and low-latency settings, uncertainty estimates must be efficiently obtained. Deep Ensembles provide robust epistemic uncertainty (EU) but require training multiple full-size models. BatchEnsemble aims to deliver ensemble-like EU at far lower parameter and memory cost by applying learned rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network. We show that BatchEnsemble not only underperforms Deep Ensembles but closely tracks a single model baseline in terms of accuracy, calibration and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on CIFAR10/10C/SVHN. A controlled study on MNIST finds members are near-identical in function and parameter space, indicating limited capacity to realize distinct predictive modes. Thus, BatchEnsemble behaves more like a single model than a true ensemble.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a SE(3)-equivariant generative model for 3D molecule generation using rigid motifs, achieving comparable or better results than atom-based methods with faster generation and compressed representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D molecular structure generation by treating molecules as rigid-body motifs rather than individual atoms, leveraging advancements in frame-based protein structure generation.

Method: Employ SE(3)-equivariant generative modeling for de novo 3D molecule generation, representing molecules as sets of rigid-body motifs.

Result: The approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, with improved atom stability on GEOM-Drugs, 2x to 10x faster generation, and 3.5x compression in molecular representations.

Conclusion: Using rigid motifs and SE(3)-equivariant modeling enables efficient and high-quality 3D molecule generation, surpassing traditional atom-based methods.

Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular structure generation is typically performed at the level of individual atoms, yet molecular graph generation techniques often consider fragments as their structural units. Building on the advances in frame-based protein structure generation, we extend these fragmentation ideas to 3D, treating general molecules as sets of rigid-body motifs. Utilising this representation, we employ SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling for de novo 3D molecule generation from rigid motifs. In our evaluations, we observe comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art across benchmarks, surpassing it in atom stability on GEOM-Drugs, while yielding a 2x to 10x reduction in generation steps and offering 3.5x compression in molecular representations compared to the standard atom-based methods.

*Mahdi Karami,Ali Ghodsi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARMD combines autoregressive and diffusion models for efficient parallel text generation, bridging the performance gap with fewer training steps and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion models lag behind autoregressive models in performance and require more training iterations. ARMD aims to merge the strengths of both approaches for better efficiency and performance.

Method: ARMD reframes masked diffusion as a block-wise causal model, enabling parallel computation of conditional probabilities and supporting autoregressive-style decoding. It introduces a strided parallel generation strategy for faster inference.

Result: ARMD outperforms diffusion baselines on language modeling benchmarks with fewer training steps and sets a new benchmark for parallel text generation.

Conclusion: ARMD successfully unifies autoregressive and diffusion models, offering efficient parallel generation and closing the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for language modeling, yet they face a performance gap compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) and require more training iterations. In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding.

*Estela Sánchez-Carballo,Francisco M. Melgarejo-Meseguer,José Luis Rojo-Álvarez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for synthetic attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection to address class imbalance and outperforms existing methods in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT environments degrades performance, and current data augmentation methods lack fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency.

Method: Leveraged Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating synthetic attack data and compared them against state-of-the-art baselines using three IoT attack types.

Result: LDM-generated samples improved IDS performance (F1-scores up to 0.99) and showed better feature dependency preservation, diversity, and 25% faster sampling than other methods.

Conclusion: LDMs are an effective, scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, mitigating class imbalance in ML-based IDSs.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a key component for protecting Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.

### [166] [A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979)
*Dayal Singh Kalra,Jean-Christophe Gagnon-Audet,Andrey Gromov,Ishita Mediratta,Kelvin Niu,Alexander H Miller,Michael Shvartsman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'critical sharpness' ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure to analyze the curvature of the loss landscape in neural networks, particularly for large models, and demonstrates its practicality in capturing training dynamics and guiding data composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the prohibitive computational cost of directly measuring Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\max}^H$) in large models like LLMs, while still capturing key curvature phenomena (e.g., progressive sharpening, Edge of Stability) to inform training practices.

Method: The authors propose 'critical sharpness' ($λ_c$), which requires fewer than 10 forward passes given the update direction, and 'relative critical sharpness' ($λ_c^{1\to 2}$) to analyze transitions between tasks (e.g., pre-training to fine-tuning). These measures are validated on OLMo-2 models up to 7B parameters.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates scalability of curvature analysis, capturing sharpness phenomena in large models and providing insights for data mixing strategies during training.

Conclusion: Critical sharpness offers a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics in large-scale training, bridging the gap between theoretical insights and actionable practices for practitioners.

Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.

### [167] [Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Collective Action and Loyalty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16237)
*Vik Pant,Eric Yu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces loyalty-moderated utility functions to address free-riding in mixed-motive multi-agent settings, validated experimentally and empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent free-riding in teams arises because individual efforts benefit all equally, but costs are borne individually. The study aims to enhance computational mechanisms for analyzing and resolving such collective action problems.

Method: The authors develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit and cost tolerance. They integrate i* structural dependencies via dependency-weighted team cohesion and validate the framework experimentally across 3,125 configurations and empirically using Apache HTTP Server data.

Result: Experimental results show robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation) and meet all behavioral targets (e.g., 96.5% free-riding baseline). Empirical validation achieves 60/60 points, reproducing contribution patterns in Apache HTTP Server.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses free-riding by leveraging loyalty mechanisms, validated through robust experimental and empirical results.

Abstract: Mixed-motive multi-agent settings are rife with persistent free-riding because individual effort benefits all members equally, yet each member bears the full cost of their own contribution. Classical work by Holmström established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%). Empirical validation using published Apache HTTP Server (1995-2023) case study achieves 60/60 points, reproducing contribution patterns across formation, growth, maturation, and governance phases. Statistical significance confirmed at p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.71.

*Anh-Duy Pham*

TL;DR: AMBER introduces a columnar state management approach using Polars DataFrame in Python-based ABM frameworks to balance accessibility and performance, achieving significant speedups and memory reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the tension between Python's accessibility and the performance needs of large-scale ABM simulations.

Method: Replacing traditional object-per-agent representation with columnar state management via Polars DataFrame.

Result: Speedups of 1.2x to 93x and 30-50% memory reduction in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Columnar state management is viable for high-performance ABM in interpreted languages.

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as an indispensable methodology for studying complex adaptive systems across the natural and social sciences. However, Python-based ABM frameworks face a fundamental tension between the accessibility that has made Python dominant in scientific computing and the performance requirements of large-scale simulations. This paper introduces AMBER, a framework that resolves this tension through a novel architectural approach: replacing the conventional object-per-agent representation with columnar state management using the Polars DataFrame library. We analyze the computational characteristics of both paradigms, present the architectural design of AMBER including its core abstractions, spatial environments, experiment management, and optimization capabilities. Empirical evaluation on three canonical benchmarks demonstrates that AMBER achieves speedups of 1.2x to 93x depending on workload characteristics, with the greatest advantages for models dominated by population-wide attribute operations. Memory profiling reveals 30-50% reduction in peak usage compared to object-oriented frameworks. Our results establish columnar state management as a viable architectural foundation for high-performance ABM in interpreted languages.
