*Gautham Vinod,Bruce Coburn,Siddeshwar Raghavan,Jiangpeng He,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for accurate, true-to-scale 3D reconstruction from monocular images enhances precision nutrition by reducing volume-estimation errors by nearly 30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for precise dietary monitoring due to diet-related chronic diseases motivates overcoming the challenge of estimating portion sizes from images.

Method: The approach uses visual features from large-scale datasets to estimate object scale, enabling true-to-life 3D reconstructions from monocular images.

Result: Experiments show a 30% reduction in mean absolute volume-estimation error compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The method bridges 3D computer vision and digital health, improving accuracy in dietary assessment for precision nutrition.

Abstract: The rise of chronic diseases related to diet, such as obesity and diabetes, emphasizes the need for accurate monitoring of food intake. While AI-driven dietary assessment has made strides in recent years, the ill-posed nature of recovering size (portion) information from monocular images for accurate estimation of ``how much did you eat?'' is a pressing challenge. Some 3D reconstruction methods have achieved impressive geometric reconstruction but fail to recover the crucial real-world scale of the reconstructed object, limiting its usage in precision nutrition. In this paper, we bridge the gap between 3D computer vision and digital health by proposing a method that recovers a true-to-scale 3D reconstructed object from a monocular image. Our approach leverages rich visual features extracted from models trained on large-scale datasets to estimate the scale of the reconstructed object. This learned scale enables us to convert single-view 3D reconstructions into true-to-life, physically meaningful models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two publicly available datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving nearly a 30% reduction in mean absolute volume-estimation error, showcasing its potential to enhance the domain of precision nutrition.

### [2] [DiSa: Saliency-Aware Foreground-Background Disentangled Framework for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20064)
*Zhen Yao,Xin Li,Taotao Jing,Shuai Zhang,Mooi Choo Chuah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiSa addresses foreground bias and limited spatial localization in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using saliency-aware disentanglement and hierarchical refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs like CLIP struggle with foreground bias and poor spatial localization in segmentation tasks.

Method: DiSa uses Saliency-aware Disentanglement Module (SDM) for foreground-background separation and Hierarchical Refinement Module (HRM) for spatial-context feature refinement.

Result: DiSa outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiSa effectively mitigates key limitations of VLMs in segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign labels to every pixel in an image based on text labels. Existing approaches typically utilize vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for dense prediction. However, VLMs, pre-trained on image-text pairs, are biased toward salient, object-centric regions and exhibit two critical limitations when adapted to segmentation: (i) Foreground Bias, which tends to ignore background regions, and (ii) Limited Spatial Localization, resulting in blurred object boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce DiSa, a novel saliency-aware foreground-background disentangled framework. By explicitly incorporating saliency cues in our designed Saliency-aware Disentanglement Module (SDM), DiSa separately models foreground and background ensemble features in a divide-and-conquer manner. Additionally, we propose a Hierarchical Refinement Module (HRM) that leverages pixel-wise spatial contexts and enables channel-wise feature refinement through multi-level updates. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DiSa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### [3] [Sparse CLIP: Co-Optimizing Interpretability and Performance in Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20075)
*Chuan Qin,Constantin Venhoff,Sonia Joseph,Fanyi Xiao,Stefan Scherer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating sparsity directly into CLIP training to create interpretable yet high-performing representations, challenging the assumption that interpretability compromises accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address CLIP's interpretability challenges without sacrificing its performance or multimodal capabilities, which current post-hoc approaches like Sparse Autoencoders fail to achieve.

Method: The method involves embedding sparsity directly into CLIP training, producing sparse yet effective representations that retain CLIP's strengths.

Result: Results show Sparse CLIP maintains strong downstream performance, superior interpretability, and multimodal capabilities, enabling semantic concept alignment and revealing training dynamics.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that interpretability and performance can coexist, offering a new design principle for future models.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a cornerstone in vision-language representation learning, powering diverse downstream tasks and serving as the default vision backbone in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite its success, CLIP's dense and opaque latent representations pose significant interpretability challenges. A common assumption is that interpretability and performance are in tension: enforcing sparsity during training degrades accuracy, motivating recent post-hoc approaches such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). However, these post-hoc approaches often suffer from degraded downstream performance and loss of CLIP's inherent multimodal capabilities, with most learned features remaining unimodal.
  We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates sparsity directly into CLIP training, yielding representations that are both interpretable and performant. Compared to SAEs, our Sparse CLIP representations preserve strong downstream task performance, achieve superior interpretability, and retain multimodal capabilities. We show that multimodal sparse features enable straightforward semantic concept alignment and reveal training dynamics of how cross-modal knowledge emerges. Finally, as a proof of concept, we train a vision-language model on sparse CLIP representations that enables interpretable, vision-based steering capabilities. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom that interpretability requires sacrificing accuracy and demonstrate that interpretability and performance can be co-optimized, offering a promising design principle for future models.

### [4] [NucFuseRank: Dataset Fusion and Performance Ranking for Nuclei Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20104)
*Nima Torbati,Anastasia Meshcheryakova,Ramona Woitek,Sepideh Hatamikia,Diana Mechtcheriakova,Amirreza Mahbod*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on standardizing and evaluating publicly available datasets for nuclei instance segmentation in H&E-stained images, proposing unified datasets (NucFuse-train and NucFuse-test) for improved benchmarking and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in standardized evaluation and benchmarking of nuclei instance segmentation datasets, which are often limited and arbitrarily selected in existing research.

Method: Identified and standardized publicly available datasets into a unified format, evaluated them using two state-of-the-art segmentation models (CNN and hybrid CNN-vision transformer), and proposed merged datasets for fair testing and improved training.

Result: Provided a systematic ranking of datasets based on performance, introduced unified datasets for cross-dataset evaluation, and established a new benchmark for nuclei instance segmentation models.

Conclusion: The work offers a robust framework for dataset evaluation and benchmarking in nuclei instance segmentation, facilitating better training and testing of models in histological image analysis.

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images plays an important role in automated histological image analysis, with various applications in downstream tasks. While several machine learning and deep learning approaches have been proposed for nuclei instance segmentation, most research in this field focuses on developing new segmentation algorithms and benchmarking them on a limited number of arbitrarily selected public datasets.
  In this work, rather than focusing on model development, we focused on the datasets used for this task. Based on an extensive literature review, we identified manually annotated, publicly available datasets of H&E-stained images for nuclei instance segmentation and standardized them into a unified input and annotation format. Using two state-of-the-art segmentation models, one based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and one based on a hybrid CNN and vision transformer architecture, we systematically evaluated and ranked these datasets based on their nuclei instance segmentation performance. Furthermore, we proposed a unified test set (NucFuse-test) for fair cross-dataset evaluation and a unified training set (NucFuse-train) for improved segmentation performance by merging images from multiple datasets.
  By evaluating and ranking the datasets, performing comprehensive analyses, generating fused datasets, conducting external validation, and making our implementation publicly available, we provided a new benchmark for training, testing, and evaluating nuclei instance segmentation models on H&E-stained histological images.

### [5] [Look in the Middle: Structural Anchor Pruning for Scalable Visual RAG Indexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20107)
*Zhuchenyang Liu,Ziyu Hu,Yao Zhang,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAP, a training-free pruning method, achieves high compression (over 90%) while maintaining retrieval performance by focusing on middle-layer visual patches, validated by the OSR protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies in existing pruning methods for Vision-Language Models, particularly under high compression (>80%), where traditional methods fail.

Method: Proposes Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP) to identify key visual patches from middle layers and introduces Oracle Score Retention (OSR) for layer-wise evaluation.

Result: SAP reduces index vectors by over 90% without compromising retrieval fidelity, outperforming prior methods in high-compression scenarios.

Conclusion: Middle layers retain semantic structural anchor patches, making SAP a scalable and effective solution for Visual RAG.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (e.g., ColPali) enable fine-grained Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) but incur prohibitive index vector size overheads. Training-free pruning solutions (e.g., EOS-attention based methods) can reduce index vector size by approximately 60% without model adaptation, but often underperform random selection in high-compression scenarios (> 80%). Prior research (e.g., Light-ColPali) attributes this to the conclusion that visual token importance is inherently query-dependent, thereby questioning the feasibility of training-free pruning. In this work, we propose Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a training-free pruning method that identifies key visual patches from middle layers to achieve high performance compression. We also introduce Oracle Score Retention (OSR) protocol to evaluate how layer-wise information affects compression efficiency. Evaluations on the ViDoRe benchmark demonstrate that SAP reduces index vectors by over 90% while maintaining robust retrieval fidelity, providing a highly scalable solution for Visual RAG. Furthermore, our OSR-based analysis reveals that semantic structural anchor patches persist in the middle layers, unlike traditional pruning solutions that focus on the final layer where structural signals dissipate.

### [6] [Efficient Token Pruning for LLaDA-V](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20168)
*Zhewen Wan,Tianchen Song,Chen Lin,Zhiyong Zhao,Xianpeng Lang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured token pruning method for diffusion-based large multimodal models like LLaDA-V, targeting middle-to-late layers to reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based models like LLaDA-V suffer from high computational costs due to bidirectional attention and iterative denoising. Analysis shows delayed semantic alignment suggests pruning opportunities.

Method: Introduces structured token pruning inspired by FastV, focusing on middle-to-late layers during the first denoising step to align with delayed attention aggregation.

Result: Reduces computational cost by up to 65% while preserving 95% of task performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method offers efficient inference for LLaDA-V and demonstrates the potential of vision-aware pruning in diffusion-based multimodal models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large multimodal models, such as LLaDA-V, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in vision-language understanding and generation. However, their bidirectional attention mechanism and diffusion-style iterative denoising paradigm introduce significant computational overhead, as visual tokens are repeatedly processed across all layers and denoising steps. In this work, we conduct an in-depth attention analysis and reveal that, unlike autoregressive decoders, LLaDA-V aggregates cross-modal information predominantly in middle-to-late layers, leading to delayed semantic alignment. Motivated by this observation, we propose a structured token pruning strategy inspired by FastV, selectively removing a proportion of visual tokens at designated layers to reduce FLOPs while preserving critical semantic information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate structured token pruning in diffusion-based large multimodal models. Unlike FastV, which focuses on shallow-layer pruning, our method targets the middle-to-late layers of the first denoising step to align with LLaDA-V's delayed attention aggregation to maintain output quality, and the first-step pruning strategy reduces the computation across all subsequent steps. Our framework provides an empirical basis for efficient LLaDA-V inference and highlights the potential of vision-aware pruning in diffusion-based multimodal models. Across multiple benchmarks, our best configuration reduces computational cost by up to 65% while preserving an average of 95% task performance.

*Shiwen Zhang,Xiaoyan Yang,Bojia Zi,Haibin Huang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeleStyle is a lightweight Diffusion Transformer model for image and video stylization, leveraging Qwen-Image-Edit and a Curriculum Continual Learning framework for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content and style entanglement in DiTs makes content-preserving style transfer challenging.

Method: Uses Qwen-Image-Edit, a hybrid dataset, Curriculum Continual Learning, and a video stylization module.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in style similarity, content consistency, and aesthetic quality.

Conclusion: TeleStyle effectively addresses content-style disentanglement and generalizes to unseen styles while maintaining content fidelity.

Abstract: Content-preserving style transfer, generating stylized outputs based on content and style references, remains a significant challenge for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) due to the inherent entanglement of content and style features in their internal representations. In this technical report, we present TeleStyle, a lightweight yet effective model for both image and video stylization. Built upon Qwen-Image-Edit, TeleStyle leverages the base model's robust capabilities in content preservation and style customization. To facilitate effective training, we curated a high-quality dataset of distinct specific styles and further synthesized triplets using thousands of diverse, in-the-wild style categories. We introduce a Curriculum Continual Learning framework to train TeleStyle on this hybrid dataset of clean (curated) and noisy (synthetic) triplets. This approach enables the model to generalize to unseen styles without compromising precise content fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a video-to-video stylization module to enhance temporal consistency and visual quality. TeleStyle achieves state-of-the-art performance across three core evaluation metrics: style similarity, content consistency, and aesthetic quality.

### [8] [Automated Marine Biofouling Assessment: Benchmarking Computer Vision and Multimodal LLMs on the Level of Fouling Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20196)
*Brayden Hamilton,Tim Cashmore,Peter Driscoll,Trevor Gee,Henry Williams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated classification of marine biofouling severity using computer vision and LLMs shows promise, with hybrid methods offering scalable and interpretable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine biofouling poses ecological and economic risks, and traditional diver inspections are unsafe and unscalable. Automated methods are needed.

Method: Evaluated custom CNNs, transformer-based segmentation, and zero-shot LLMs on an expert-labelled dataset using structured prompts and retrieval.

Result: Computer vision excelled in extreme LoF categories but struggled with intermediates. LLMs achieved competitive performance without training and were interpretable.

Conclusion: Hybrid methods combining segmentation and LLM reasoning show potential for scalable and interpretable biofouling assessment.

Abstract: Marine biofouling on vessel hulls poses major ecological, economic, and biosecurity risks. Traditional survey methods rely on diver inspections, which are hazardous and limited in scalability. This work investigates automated classification of biofouling severity on the Level of Fouling (LoF) scale using both custom computer vision models and large multimodal language models (LLMs). Convolutional neural networks, transformer-based segmentation, and zero-shot LLMs were evaluated on an expert-labelled dataset from the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries. Computer vision models showed high accuracy at extreme LoF categories but struggled with intermediate levels due to dataset imbalance and image framing. LLMs, guided by structured prompts and retrieval, achieved competitive performance without training and provided interpretable outputs. The results demonstrate complementary strengths across approaches and suggest that hybrid methods integrating segmentation coverage with LLM reasoning offer a promising pathway toward scalable and interpretable biofouling assessment.

### [9] [DenseGRPO: From Sparse to Dense Reward for Flow Matching Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20218)
*Haoyou Deng,Keyu Yan,Chaojie Mao,Xiang Wang,Yu Liu,Changxin Gao,Nong Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseGRPO improves human preference alignment in text-to-image generation by introducing dense rewards and adaptive exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the mismatch between global feedback signals and intermediate contributions in GRPO-based methods.

Method: Proposes step-wise reward prediction and reward-aware exploration space calibration.

Result: Shows effectiveness in multiple benchmarks, enhancing alignment with human preferences.

Conclusion: Dense rewards and adaptive exploration are crucial for flow matching model alignment.

Abstract: Recent GRPO-based approaches built on flow matching models have shown remarkable improvements in human preference alignment for text-to-image generation. Nevertheless, they still suffer from the sparse reward problem: the terminal reward of the entire denoising trajectory is applied to all intermediate steps, resulting in a mismatch between the global feedback signals and the exact fine-grained contributions at intermediate denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{DenseGRPO}, a novel framework that aligns human preference with dense rewards, which evaluates the fine-grained contribution of each denoising step. Specifically, our approach includes two key components: (1) we propose to predict the step-wise reward gain as dense reward of each denoising step, which applies a reward model on the intermediate clean images via an ODE-based approach. This manner ensures an alignment between feedback signals and the contributions of individual steps, facilitating effective training; and (2) based on the estimated dense rewards, a mismatch drawback between the uniform exploration setting and the time-varying noise intensity in existing GRPO-based methods is revealed, leading to an inappropriate exploration space. Thus, we propose a reward-aware scheme to calibrate the exploration space by adaptively adjusting a timestep-specific stochasticity injection in the SDE sampler, ensuring a suitable exploration space at all timesteps. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DenseGRPO and highlight the critical role of the valid dense rewards in flow matching model alignment.

### [10] [Feature Projection Learning for Better Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20224)
*Yi Zhang,Weicheng Lin,Liang-Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature Projection Learning (FPL), a method to efficiently adapt Vision-Language Pre-Trained models like CLIP for downstream tasks, achieving better performance with fewer learnable parameters and shorter training times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for adapting CLIP to downstream tasks face issues like limited performance, excessive parameters, or long training times. FPL aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: FPL uses a projection model to transform class prototype features into the query image feature space, reconstructing the feature map. The negative reconstruction error acts as the class score, turning classification into a feature projection problem.

Result: FPL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods significantly in accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: FPL offers a simple, efficient, and effective way to adapt CLIP for downstream tasks, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-Trained models, notably CLIP, that utilize contrastive learning have proven highly adept at extracting generalizable visual features. To inherit the well-learned knowledge of VLP models for downstream tasks, several approaches aim to adapt them efficiently with limited supervision. However, these methods either suffer from limited performance, excessive learnable parameters, or extended training times, all of which hinder their effectiveness in adapting the CLIP model to downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient and effective method called \textit{\textbf{F}eature \textbf{P}rojection \textbf{L}earning(FPL)} to address these problems. Specifically, we develop a projection model that projects class prototype features into the query image feature space and reconstructs the query image feature map. The negative average squared reconstruction error is used as the class score. In this way, we transform the classification problem into a feature projection problem. The final output of this method is a combination of the prediction from the projection model and the original pre-trained CLIP. Comprehensive empirical evaluations confirm that FPL delivers superior accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.

### [11] [Visual Prompt-Agnostic Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20232)
*Junze Wang,Lei Fan,Dezheng Zhang,Weipeng Jing,Donglin Di,Yang Song,Sidong Liu,Cong Cong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prompt-Agnostic Evolution ($	ext{PAE}$) to stabilize Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) training dynamics by addressing gradient oscillations and cross-layer mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VPT variants suffer from unstable training dynamics, shallow-layer prompt stagnation, and deeper-layer oscillations, slowing convergence and degrading performance.

Method: $	ext{PAE}$ models prompt dynamics via frequency-domain initialization, a shared Koopman operator for coherent updates, and Lyapunov-inspired regularization.

Result: $	ext{PAE}$ achieves a 1.41× speedup and 1--3% accuracy boost on 25 datasets, integrating seamlessly with VPT variants.

Conclusion: $	ext{PAE}$ effectively stabilizes VPT training, enhancing performance and convergence without backbone modifications.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) adapts a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT) to downstream tasks by inserting a small number of learnable prompt tokens into the token sequence at each layer. However, we observe that existing VPT variants often suffer from unstable training dynamics, characterized by gradient oscillations. A layer-wise analysis reveals that shallow-layer prompts tend to stagnate early, while deeper-layer prompts exhibit high-variance oscillations, leading to cross-layer mismatch. These issues slow convergence and degrade final performance. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Evolution ($\mathtt{PAE}$), which strengthens vision prompt tuning by explicitly modeling prompt dynamics. From a frequency-domain perspective, we initialize prompts in a task-aware direction by uncovering and propagating frequency shortcut patterns that the backbone inherently exploits for recognition. To ensure coherent evolution across layers, we employ a shared Koopman operator that imposes a global linear transformation instead of uncoordinated, layer-specific updates. Finally, inspired by Lyapunov stability theory, we introduce a regularizer that constrains error amplification during evolution. Extensive experiments show that $\mathtt{PAE}$ accelerates convergence with an average $1.41\times$ speedup and improves accuracy by 1--3% on 25 datasets across multiple downstream tasks. Beyond performance, $\mathtt{PAE}$ is prompt-agnostic and lightweight, and it integrates seamlessly with diverse VPT variants without backbone modification or inference-time changes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLenDeR, a diffusion sampling method, enhances intra-class diversity in Deep Metric Learning (DML) by using set-theory operations on denoising residuals, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Generative Models (DGM) can generate synthetic data to augment authentic data in DML, but existing methods lack controllability in intra-class diversity. BLenDeR addresses this gap.

Method: BLenDeR leverages union and intersection operations on denoising residuals from diffusion models to synthesize diverse attribute combinations within classes.

Result: BLenDeR achieves a 3.7% increase in Recall@1 on CUB-200 and a 1.8% increase on Cars-196 compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: BLenDeR effectively improves DML performance by controllably increasing intra-class diversity through diffusion sampling.

Abstract: The rise of Deep Generative Models (DGM) has enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data. When used to augment authentic data in Deep Metric Learning (DML), these synthetic samples enhance intra-class diversity and improve the performance of downstream DML tasks. We introduce BLenDeR, a diffusion sampling method designed to increase intra-class diversity for DML in a controllable way by leveraging set-theory inspired union and intersection operations on denoising residuals. The union operation encourages any attribute present across multiple prompts, while the intersection extracts the common direction through a principal component surrogate. These operations enable controlled synthesis of diverse attribute combinations within each class, addressing key limitations of existing generative approaches. Experiments on standard DML benchmarks demonstrate that BLenDeR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets and backbones. Specifically, BLenDeR achieves 3.7% increase in Recall@1 on CUB-200 and a 1.8% increase on Cars-196, compared to state-of-the-art baselines under standard experimental settings.

*Xingxin Xu,Bing Cao,DongDong Li,Qinghua Hu,Pengfei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Reversible Efficient Diffusion (RED) model for multi-modal image fusion, addressing detail loss and computational inefficiency in traditional diffusion models by incorporating explicit supervision without distribution estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models lose fine details in image fusion due to noise errors from the Markov process, and explicit supervision introduces computational inefficiency. The RED model aims to overcome these issues.

Method: The RED model is introduced as an explicitly supervised training framework that leverages diffusion models' generative power while avoiding distribution estimation.

Result: The RED model achieves efficient image fusion by preserving fine details and high visual fidelity without computational inefficiency.

Conclusion: The RED framework successfully addresses the limitations of traditional diffusion models in image fusion, offering improved detail retention and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion aims to consolidate complementary information from diverse source images into a unified representation. The fused image is expected to preserve fine details and maintain high visual fidelity. While diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities in image generation, they often suffer from detail loss when applied to image fusion tasks. This issue arises from the accumulation of noise errors inherent in the Markov process, leading to inconsistency and degradation in the fused results. However, incorporating explicit supervision into end-to-end training of diffusion-based image fusion introduces challenges related to computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Reversible Efficient Diffusion (RED) model - an explicitly supervised training framework that inherits the powerful generative capability of diffusion models while avoiding the distribution estimation.

### [14] [Hallucination Begins Where Saliency Drops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20279)
*Xiaofeng Zhang,Yuanchao Zhu,Chaochen Gu,Xiaosong Yuan,Qiyan Zhao,Jiawei Cao,Feilong Tang,Sinan Fan,Yaomin Shen,Chen Shen,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs-Saliency is a gradient-aware framework combining attention and gradients to detect and mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs, improving reliability without losing fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to reliably distinguish hallucinations in LVLMs as they ignore gradient-based signals, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: Introduces LVLMs-Saliency, fusing attention weights with gradients, and proposes SGRS and LocoRE for inference-time hallucination mitigation.

Result: Significantly reduces hallucination rates while maintaining model fluency and task performance.

Conclusion: LVLMs-Saliency offers an interpretable and effective solution to enhance LVLM reliability.

Abstract: Recent studies have examined attention dynamics in large vision-language models (LVLMs) to detect hallucinations. However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability.

### [15] [A Source-Free Approach for Domain Adaptation via Multiview Image Transformation and Latent Space Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20284)
*Debopom Sutradhar,Md. Abdur Rahman,Mohaimenul Azam Khan Raiaan,Reem E. Mohamed,Sami Azam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method using multiview augmentation and latent space consistency to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain, achieving superior accuracy without traditional alignment or pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing domain adaptation methods are computationally expensive and often require access to source data or adversarial training. This paper aims to simplify the process by eliminating dependencies on source data and reducing complexity.

Method: The proposed method uses multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques, along with a ConvNeXt-based encoder and a combined classification-consistency loss function, to learn transferable representations directly from the target domain.

Result: The model achieves average classification accuracies of 90.72%, 84%, and 97.12% on Office-31, Office-Home, and Office-Caltech datasets, respectively, outperforming existing methods by +1.23%, +7.%, and +1.77%.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a simpler yet effective source-free domain adaptation approach, improving performance while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain where image data distributions may differ. Existing DA methods often require access to source domain data, adversarial training, or complex pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method. It is the first approach to use multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain. Our method eliminates the need for source-target alignment or pseudo-label refinement by learning transferable representations solely from the target domain by enforcing consistency between multiple augmented views in the latent space. Additionally, the method ensures consistency in the learned features by generating multiple augmented views of target domain data and minimizing the distance between their feature representations in the latent space. We also introduce a ConvNeXt-based encoder and design a loss function that combines classification and consistency objectives to drive effective adaptation directly from the target domain. The proposed model achieves an average classification accuracy of 90. 72\%, 84\%, and 97. 12\% in Office-31, Office-Home and Office-Caltech datasets, respectively. Further evaluations confirm that our study improves existing methods by an average classification accuracy increment of +1.23\%, +7.26\%, and +1.77\% on the respective datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation methods lack detailed localization and categorization of artifacts, prompting the need for a more robust approach to assess generative video quality.

Method: The authors define a taxonomy of 10 artifact categories and create GenVID, a dataset of 80k annotated videos. They then develop DVAR, a framework for dense artifact recognition.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved artifact detection accuracy and effective filtering of low-quality content.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol and tools enhance the evaluation and auditing of generated videos, addressing gaps in current methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation techniques, evaluating and auditing generated videos has become increasingly crucial. Existing approaches typically offer coarse video quality scores, lacking detailed localization and categorization of specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol focusing on three key aspects affecting human perception: Appearance, Motion, and Camera. We define these axes through a taxonomy of 10 prevalent artifact categories reflecting common generative failures observed in video generation. To enable robust artifact detection and categorization, we introduce GenVID, a large-scale dataset of 80k videos generated by various state-of-the-art video generation models, each carefully annotated for the defined artifact categories. Leveraging GenVID, we develop DVAR, a Dense Video Artifact Recognition framework for fine-grained identification and classification of generative artifacts. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves artifact detection accuracy and enables effective filtering of low-quality content.

*Jialuo He,Huangxun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C-SAM integrates sharpness-aware learning with pruning by perturbing pruning masks instead of parameters, improving model robustness and compactness without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in how SAM interacts with pruning for on-device DNNs, as standard SAM or pruning alone can compromise robustness or compactness.

Method: Proposes C-SAM, which perturbs pruning masks during training to ensure a flatter loss landscape under structural changes, optimizing both robustness and compactness.

Result: C-SAM achieves up to 42% higher certified robustness on datasets (CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, CIFAR-10-C) and models (ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, MobileNet-V2) while maintaining task accuracy.

Conclusion: C-SAM successfully bridges the gap between SAM and pruning, enabling robust and compact models for on-device deployment.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has recently emerged as an effective technique for improving DNN robustness to input variations. However, its interplay with the compactness requirements of on-device DNN deployments remains less explored. Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.

*Suresh Das,Siladittya Manna,Sayantari Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses covariate shift challenges in medical image segmentation, proposing a dual domain learning strategy combining NA and WA CT data to improve robustness and achieve high segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation due to covariate shift is a challenge in medical image segmentation, especially with scarce WA CT data showing anatomical deformation and artifacts.

Method: A dual domain learning strategy is introduced, integrating NA and WA CT data, with experiments conducted across multiple planes and deep learning architectures.

Result: Using 10-30% WA data alongside NA data achieves segmentation performance comparable to WA-only models, with Dice scores up to 0.94 and IoU up to 0.92.

Conclusion: Integrating shifted distribution datasets effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances segmentation reliability for brachytherapy planning.

Abstract: Performance degradation due to covariate shift remains a major challenge for deep learning models in medical image segmentation. An open question is whether samples from a shifted distribution can effectively support learning when combined with limited target domain data. We investigate this problem in the context of bladder segmentation in CT guided gynecological brachytherapy, a critical task for accurate dose optimization and organ at risk sparing. While CT scans without brachytherapy applicators (no applicator: NA) are widely available, scans with applicators inserted (with applicator: WA) are scarce and exhibit substantial anatomical deformation and imaging artifacts, making automated segmentation particularly difficult.
  We propose a dual domain learning strategy that integrates NA and WA CT data to improve robustness and generalizability under covariate shift. Using a curated assorted dataset, we show that NA data alone fail to capture the anatomical and artifact related characteristics of WA images. However, introducing a modest proportion of WA data into a predominantly NA training set leads to significant performance improvements. Through systematic experiments across axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using multiple deep learning architectures, we demonstrate that doping only 10 to 30 percent WA data achieves segmentation performance comparable to models trained exclusively on WA data.
  The proposed approach attains Dice similarity coefficients of up to 0.94 and Intersection over Union scores of up to 0.92, indicating effective domain adaptation and improved clinical reliability. This study highlights the value of integrating anatomically similar but distribution shifted datasets to overcome data scarcity and enhance deep learning based segmentation for brachytherapy treatment planning.

*Sungjae Lee,Junhan Jeong,Yeonjoo Hong,Kwang In Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method estimating object mass from single RGB images using 3D geometry and material semantics, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass estimation from visual input is ill-posed due to unobservable volume and density; physical constraints are needed for accurate predictions.

Method: Recovers 3D geometry via monocular depth for volume, uses vision-language models for material semantics, and fuses features with adaptive gating.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on image2mass and ABO-500 datasets.

Conclusion: Physically structured representations improve mass estimation accuracy from single images.

Abstract: Estimating object mass from visual input is challenging because mass depends jointly on geometric volume and material-dependent density, neither of which is directly observable from RGB appearance. Consequently, mass prediction from pixels is ill-posed and therefore benefits from physically meaningful representations to constrain the space of plausible solutions. We propose a physically structured framework for single-image mass estimation that addresses this ambiguity by aligning visual cues with the physical factors governing mass. From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision. Experiments on image2mass and ABO-500 show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: SLDM uses structural synergy and spatial intelligence to generate normal-dose CT images from low-dose ICM, ensuring accuracy and reducing risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overdose of iodinated contrast media (ICM) in CT scans can cause kidney damage and allergic reactions. Existing methods struggle with incompletely paired images and limited structure recognition.

Method: Proposed Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM) integrates structural priors and semantic supervision with spatial intelligence for accurate enhancement.

Result: SLDM achieves effective angiographic reconstruction for low-dose CT, maintaining diagnostic power while reducing ICM dose.

Conclusion: SLDM outperforms existing methods by leveraging structural constraints and spatial intelligence, offering a safer solution for ICM use in CT imaging.

Abstract: The application of iodinated contrast media (ICM) improves the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography (CT) for a wide range of clinical indications. However, overdose of ICM can cause problems such as kidney damage and life-threatening allergic reactions. Deep learning methods can generate CT images of normal-dose ICM from low-dose ICM, reducing the required dose while maintaining diagnostic power. However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process. Subsequently, semantic supervision strategy with spatial intelligence is introduced, which integrates the functions of visual perception and spatial reasoning, thus prompting the model to achieve accurate enhancement. Finally, the subtraction angiography enhancement module is applied, which serves to improve the contrast of the ICM agent region to suitable interval for observation. Qualitative analysis of visual comparison and quantitative results of several metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in angiographic reconstruction for low-dose contrast medium CT angiography.

*Yanjie Tu,Qingsen Yan,Axi Niu,Jiacong Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPGDiff introduces a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion network for unified image restoration, combining degradation, structural, and semantic priors hierarchically to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with severe degradation and disrupt spatial structures when integrating semantic information in shallow layers.

Method: TPGDiff uses degradation priors throughout diffusion, structural priors in shallow layers, and semantic priors in deep layers, along with a degradation extractor for adaptive control.

Result: Experiments show TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration tasks.

Conclusion: TPGDiff effectively integrates hierarchical priors for robust and high-quality image restoration.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to address diverse degradation types using a single unified model. Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

*Shuoyan Wei,Feng Li,Chen Zhou,Runmin Cong,Yao Zhao,Huihui Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OSDEnhancer, a novel one-step diffusion framework for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), addressing complex real-world degradations with a focus on temporal coherence and spatial detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STVSR methods struggle with real-world scenarios due to simplified degradation assumptions and lack of robust frameworks for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency.

Method: OSDEnhancer uses a linear pre-interpolation strategy for spatiotemporal initialization, employs a TR-SE MoE for specialized temporal and spatial learning, and incorporates a bidirectional deformable VAE decoder for cross-frame fidelity.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior generalization in real-world STVSR scenarios.

Conclusion: OSDEnhancer effectively addresses the challenges of real-world STVSR through its innovative one-step diffusion process and collaborative expert pathways.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in video super-resolution (VSR), showcasing a powerful capacity for generating fine-grained details. However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior generalization capability in real-world scenarios.

*Jiyuan Xu,Wenyu Zhang,Xin Jing,Shuai Chen,Shuai Zhang,Jiahao Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPiRi is a channel permutation invariant framework for multivariate time series forecasting, combining spatio-temporal decoupling and permutation-invariant training to handle dynamic channel structures without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with channel ordering dependencies (channel-dependent) or ignore inter-channel relations (channel-independent), limiting flexibility and performance.

Method: CPiRi uses a pretrained temporal encoder, lightweight spatial module, and channel shuffling for permutation-invariant learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, stable under channel shuffling, and generalizes to unseen channels with practical efficiency.

Conclusion: CPiRi addresses limitations of current methods, offering robustness and scalability for dynamic channel settings.

Abstract: Current methods for multivariate time series forecasting can be classified into channel-dependent and channel-independent models. Channel-dependent models learn cross-channel features but often overfit the channel ordering, which hampers adaptation when channels are added or reordered. Channel-independent models treat each channel in isolation to increase flexibility, yet this neglects inter-channel dependencies and limits performance. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CPiRi}, a \textbf{channel permutation invariant (CPI)} framework that infers cross-channel structure from data rather than memorizing a fixed ordering, enabling deployment in settings with structural and distributional co-drift without retraining. CPiRi couples \textbf{spatio-temporal decoupling architecture} with \textbf{permutation-invariant regularization training strategy}: a frozen pretrained temporal encoder extracts high-quality temporal features, a lightweight spatial module learns content-driven inter-channel relations, while a channel shuffling strategy enforces CPI during training. We further \textbf{ground CPiRi in theory} by analyzing permutation equivariance in multivariate time series forecasting. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show state-of-the-art results. CPiRi remains stable when channel orders are shuffled and exhibits strong \textbf{inductive generalization} to unseen channels even when trained on \textbf{only half} of the channels, while maintaining \textbf{practical efficiency} on large-scale datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint and a progressive quadtree-calibrated monocular depth constraint to improve surface reconstruction in 3D Gaussian Splatting, outperforming prior methods on DTU and TNT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for surface reconstruction in 3D Gaussian Splatting face challenges with unreliable multi-view constraints under large geometric discrepancies and monocular depth priors with scale ambiguity and local inconsistency, leading to inaccurate depth supervision.

Method: The authors propose two key methods: (1) a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint that aggregates visibility of shared Gaussian primitives, and (2) a progressive quadtree-calibrated monocular depth constraint for block-wise affine calibration. Both aim to improve depth supervision accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments on DTU and TNT datasets show consistent improvements in geometric accuracy over prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: The proposed constraints effectively address the limitations of prior methods, leading to more accurate and stable surface reconstruction in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables efficient optimization and high-quality rendering, yet accurate surface reconstruction remains challenging. Prior methods improve surface reconstruction by refining Gaussian depth estimates, either via multi-view geometric consistency or through monocular depth priors. However, multi-view constraints become unreliable under large geometric discrepancies, while monocular priors suffer from scale ambiguity and local inconsistency, ultimately leading to inaccurate Gaussian depth supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint that aggregates the visibility of shared Gaussian primitives across views, enabling more accurate and stable geometric supervision. In addition, we propose a progressive quadtree-calibrated Monocular depth constraint that performs block-wise affine calibration from coarse to fine spatial scales, mitigating the scale ambiguity of depth priors while preserving fine-grained surface details. Extensive experiments on DTU and TNT datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in geometric accuracy over prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: TopoOT integrates topology-aware optimal transport with test-time adaptation for anomaly segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance by leveraging multi-filtration persistence diagrams and stability-aware pseudo-labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep topological data analysis captures structural invariants like connectivity and cycles, making it suitable for anomaly segmentation by characterizing anomalies as disruptions to global structure rather than local fluctuations.

Method: TopoOT uses Optimal Transport Chaining to align persistence diagrams across thresholds and filtrations, generating stability scores. These scores supervise a lightweight head trained online with OT-consistency and contrastive objectives for robust adaptation.

Result: TopoOT outperforms competitive methods by up to +24.1% mean F1 on 2D datasets and +10.2% on 3D anomaly segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: TopoOT's topology-aware framework demonstrates superior performance in anomaly segmentation by leveraging global structural invariants and robust adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Deep topological data analysis (TDA) offers a principled framework for capturing structural invariants such as connectivity and cycles that persist across scales, making it a natural fit for anomaly segmentation (AS). Unlike thresholdbased binarisation, which produces brittle masks under distribution shift, TDA allows anomalies to be characterised as disruptions to global structure rather than local fluctuations. We introduce TopoOT, a topology-aware optimal transport (OT) framework that integrates multi-filtration persistence diagrams (PDs) with test-time adaptation (TTA). Our key innovation is Optimal Transport Chaining, which sequentially aligns PDs across thresholds and filtrations, yielding geodesic stability scores that identify features consistently preserved across scales. These stabilityaware pseudo-labels supervise a lightweight head trained online with OT-consistency and contrastive objectives, ensuring robust adaptation under domain shift. Across standard 2D and 3D anomaly detection benchmarks, TopoOT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the most competitive methods by up to +24.1% mean F1 on 2D datasets and +10.2% on 3D AS benchmarks.

*Chenke Zhang,Ziyuan Yang,Licheng Yan,Shuyi Li,Andrew Beng Jin Teoh,Bob Zhang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PalmBridge is a feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification. It uses vector quantization to mitigate domain shifts and improves recognition performance without significant runtime costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world palmprint recognition suffers from feature distribution shifts due to heterogeneous conditions. Existing models overfit to dataset-specific textures, lacking domain-invariant learning.

Method: PalmBridge learns representative vectors from training features, maps feature vectors to their nearest representatives, and blends them. It optimizes these vectors with task supervision, feature-consistency, and orthogonality regularization.

Result: PalmBridge reduces EER in intra-dataset open-set evaluation and enhances cross-dataset generalization, with minimal runtime overhead.

Conclusion: PalmBridge effectively addresses domain shifts in palmprint recognition, offering a practical solution for improving verification performance.

Abstract: Palmprint recognition is widely used in biometric systems, yet real-world performance often degrades due to feature distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous deployment conditions. Most deep palmprint models assume a closed and stationary distribution, leading to overfitting to dataset-specific textures rather than learning domain-invariant representations. Although data augmentation is commonly used to mitigate this issue, it assumes augmented samples can approximate the target deployment distribution, an assumption that often fails under significant domain mismatch. To address this limitation, we propose PalmBridge, a plug-and-play feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification based on vector quantization. Rather than relying solely on data-level augmentation, PalmBridge learns a compact set of representative vectors directly from training features. During enrollment and verification, each feature vector is mapped to its nearest representative vector under a minimum-distance criterion, and the mapped vector is then blended with the original vector. This design suppresses nuisance variation induced by domain shifts while retaining discriminative identity cues. The representative vectors are jointly optimized with the backbone network using task supervision, a feature-consistency objective, and an orthogonality regularization term to form a stable and well-structured shared embedding space. Furthermore, we analyze feature-to-representative mappings via assignment consistency and collision rate to assess model's sensitivity to blending weights. Experiments on multiple palmprint datasets and backbone architectures show that PalmBridge consistently reduces EER in intra-dataset open-set evaluation and improves cross-dataset generalization with negligible to modest runtime overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpatialGenEval, a benchmark to evaluate spatial intelligence in text-to-image models, and SpatialT2I, a dataset to improve spatial reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models struggle with complex spatial relationships, and existing benchmarks lack dense prompts to evaluate these aspects.

Method: The authors created SpatialGenEval with 1,230 dense prompts across 25 scenes and SpatialT2I with 15,400 rewritten text-image pairs. They evaluated 21 models and fine-tuned three foundation models.

Result: Higher-order spatial reasoning is identified as a bottleneck. Fine-tuning models with SpatialT2I data improved performance (+4.2% to +5.7%).

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for dense prompts and datasets to enhance spatial intelligence in T2I models, proposing a data-centric solution.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-fidelity images, but they often fail in handling complex spatial relationships, e.g., spatial perception, reasoning, or interaction. These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.

Motivation: Scene graphs often overfit to spurious correlations, hindering out-of-distribution generalization. CURVE aims to address this by focusing on invariant interactions.

Method: The framework integrates uncertainty modeling with structural regularization, using prototype-conditioned debiasing to disentangle invariant dynamics from environment-specific variations.

Result: CURVE performs well in zero-shot transfer and sim-to-real adaptation, learning domain-stable sparse topologies and providing reliable uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: CURVE effectively suppresses high-variance relations, enhancing generalization and risk prediction under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Scene graphs provide structured abstractions for scene understanding, yet they often overfit to spurious correlations, severely hindering out-of-distribution generalization. To address this limitation, we propose CURVE, a causality-inspired framework that integrates variational uncertainty modeling with uncertainty-guided structural regularization to suppress high-variance, environment-specific relations. Specifically, we apply prototype-conditioned debiasing to disentangle invariant interaction dynamics from environment-dependent variations, promoting a sparse and domain-stable topology. Empirically, we evaluate CURVE in zero-shot transfer and low-data sim-to-real adaptation, verifying its ability to learn domain-stable sparse topologies and provide reliable uncertainty estimates to support risk prediction under distribution shifts.

TL;DR: RAW-Flow introduces a generative approach using deterministic latent transport to improve RGB-to-RAW reconstruction, addressing detail inconsistency and color deviation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and information loss in RGB images.

Method: RAW-Flow uses flow matching for deterministic latent transport, a cross-scale context guidance module, and a dual-domain latent autoencoder with feature alignment.

Result: RAW-Flow outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and visually.

Conclusion: The generative perspective and novel framework effectively bridge RGB and RAW representations, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction.

Abstract: RGB-to-RAW reconstruction, or the reverse modeling of a camera Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, aims to recover high-fidelity RAW data from RGB images. Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process. Moreover, we design a dual-domain latent autoencoder with a feature alignment constraint to support the proposed latent transport framework, which jointly encodes RGB and RAW inputs while promoting stable training and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAW-Flow outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and visually.

Both subsystems utilize ESP32 microcontrollers for edge processing and wireless connectivity. Experimental evaluation over 45 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: 99.2\% RFID authentication accuracy with 0.82-second average response time, 98.5\% flame detection reliability within 5-meter range, and 99.8\% cloud data logging success rate. The system maintains operational integrity during network disruptions through intelligent local caching mechanisms and achieves total implementation cost of 5,400 BDT (approximately \$48), representing an 82\% reduction compared to commercial integrated solutions. This research establishes a practical framework for synergistic security-safety integration, demonstrating that professional-grade performance can be achieved through careful architectural design and component optimization while maintaining exceptional cost-effectiveness and accessibility for diverse application scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like scale variations, occlusions, and high computational costs in crowd counting.

Method: Uses a RepLK-ViT backbone, ASPP and CAN fusion, and avoids attention mechanisms for efficiency.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with 34% faster inference than state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: RepSFNet is efficient for real-time, low-power crowd-counting applications.

Abstract: Crowd counting remains challenging in variable-density scenes due to scale variations, occlusions, and the high computational cost of existing models. To address these issues, we propose RepSFNet (Reparameterized Single Fusion Network), a lightweight architecture designed for accurate and real-time crowd estimation. RepSFNet leverages a RepLK-ViT backbone with large reparameterized kernels for efficient multi-scale feature extraction. It further integrates a Feature Fusion module combining Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and Context-Aware Network (CAN) to achieve robust, density-adaptive context modeling. A Concatenate Fusion module is employed to preserve spatial resolution and generate high-quality density maps. By avoiding attention mechanisms and multi-branch designs, RepSFNet significantly reduces parameters and computational complexity. The training objective combines Mean Squared Error and Optimal Transport loss to improve both count accuracy and spatial distribution alignment. Experiments conducted on ShanghaiTech, NWPU, and UCF-QNRF datasets demonstrate that RepSFNet achieves competitive accuracy while reducing inference latency by up to 34 percent compared to recent state-of-the-art methods, making it suitable for real-time and low-power edge computing applications.

### [32] [HINT: Hierarchical Interaction Modeling for Autoregressive Multi-Human Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20383)
*Mengge Liu,Yan Di,Gu Wang,Yun Qu,Dekai Zhu,Yanyan Li,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HINT is an autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with hierarchical interaction modeling, addressing limitations in handling variable text and agent counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited by fixed-length motions and agent counts, prompting the need for autoregressive solutions like HINT for dynamic scenarios.

Method: HINT uses disentangled motion representation, a sliding-window strategy, and hierarchical interaction modeling to enable efficient and coherent motion generation.

Result: HINT performs comparably to offline models and outperforms autoregressive baselines, achieving a lower FID of 3.100 on InterHuman.

Conclusion: HINT effectively addresses challenges in multi-human motion generation, offering a scalable and autoregressive solution with superior performance.

Abstract: Text-driven multi-human motion generation with complex interactions remains a challenging problem. Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance. This strategy not only enables fine-grained interaction modeling within each window but also preserves long-horizon coherence across all the long sequence. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HINT matches the performance of strong offline models and surpasses autoregressive baselines. Notably, on InterHuman, HINT achieves an FID of 3.100, significantly improving over the previous state-of-the-art score of 5.154.

*Yuhao Sun,Chengyi Cai,Jiacheng Zhang,Zesheng Ye,Xingliang Yuan,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiFTA improves zero-shot performance in vision-language models by refining redundant image patches and text descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained text descriptions and localized image patches often contain redundancy, reducing alignment effectiveness.

Method: BiFTA uses view refinement (removing redundant patches) and description refinement (removing redundant text) for better alignment.

Result: BiFTA achieves superior zero-shot performance on 6 benchmark datasets for CLIP models.

Conclusion: Removing redundancy in visual-text alignment is necessary for improved performance.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that aligning fine-grained text descriptions with localized image patches can significantly improve the zero-shot performance of pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). However, we find that both fine-grained text descriptions and localized image patches often contain redundant information, making text-visual alignment less effective. In this paper, we tackle this issue from two perspectives: \emph{View Refinement} and \emph{Description refinement}, termed as \textit{\textbf{Bi}-refinement for \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{T}ext-visual \textbf{A}lignment} (BiFTA). \emph{View refinement} removes redundant image patches with high \emph{Intersection over Union} (IoU) ratios, resulting in more distinctive visual samples. \emph{Description refinement} removes redundant text descriptions with high pairwise cosine similarity, ensuring greater diversity in the remaining descriptions. BiFTA achieves superior zero-shot performance on 6 benchmark datasets for both ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP, justifying the necessity to remove redundant information in visual-text alignment.

TL;DR: The Quartet of Diffusions framework generates structured 3D point clouds by coordinating four diffusion models for global shape, symmetry, parts, and assembly, ensuring symmetry and fine-grained control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current point cloud generation methods by explicitly modeling part composition and symmetry for better structure-aware outputs.

Method: Uses four coordinated diffusion models to learn distributions of global shape, symmetry, semantic parts, and part assembly, ensuring coherence and diversity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with guaranteed symmetry, coherent part placement, and diverse, high-quality outputs.

Conclusion: The Quartet of Diffusions is the first framework to fully integrate symmetry and part priors in 3D point cloud generation, offering fine-grained control and structural coherence.

Abstract: We introduce the Quartet of Diffusions, a structure-aware point cloud generation framework that explicitly models part composition and symmetry. Unlike prior methods that treat shape generation as a holistic process or only support part composition, our approach leverages four coordinated diffusion models to learn distributions of global shape latents, symmetries, semantic parts, and their spatial assembly. This structured pipeline ensures guaranteed symmetry, coherent part placement, and diverse, high-quality outputs. By disentangling the generative process into interpretable components, our method supports fine-grained control over shape attributes, enabling targeted manipulation of individual parts while preserving global consistency. A central global latent further reinforces structural coherence across assembled parts. Our experiments show that the Quartet achieves state-of-the-art performance. To our best knowledge, this is the first 3D point cloud generation framework that fully integrates and enforces both symmetry and part priors throughout the generative process.

TL;DR: Youtu-Parsing is a high-performance document parsing model using a Vision Transformer and a prompt-guided language model, featuring parallel decoding strategies for speed and efficiency, achieving SOTA results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient and versatile document parsing for large-scale document intelligence, aiming to improve speed and accuracy in extracting diverse document elements.

Method: Uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) with a dynamic-resolution encoder and a Youtu-LLM-2B model for layout analysis. Introduces high-parallelism decoding via token and query parallelism.

Result: Achieves 5--11x speedup over autoregressive decoding and maintains output quality with query parallelism. SOTA performance on OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks.

Conclusion: Youtu-Parsing is robust, efficient, and practical for large-scale document parsing, supporting diverse elements like text, tables, and handwritten content.

Abstract: This paper presents Youtu-Parsing, an efficient and versatile document parsing model designed for high-performance content extraction. The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong robustness when handling rare characters, multilingual text, and handwritten content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-Parsing achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both the OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks. Overall, Youtu-Parsing demonstrates significant experimental value and practical utility for large-scale document intelligence applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancements in generative models require more robust and explainable Deepfake detection methods to combat malicious content.

Method: MARE uses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for text-spatial alignment and introduces a forgery disentanglement module to capture forgery traces.

Result: MARE achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and reliability, validated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: MARE provides an effective, explainable, and reliable approach for Deepfake detection by leveraging multimodal alignment and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Deepfake detection is a widely researched topic that is crucial for combating the spread of malicious content, with existing methods mainly modeling the problem as classification or spatial localization. The rapid advancements in generative models impose new demands on Deepfake detection. In this paper, we propose multimodal alignment and reinforcement for explainable Deepfake detection via vision-language models, termed MARE, which aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in Deepfake detection and reasoning. Specifically, MARE designs comprehensive reward functions, incorporating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to incentivize the generation of text-spatially aligned reasoning content that adheres to human preferences. Besides, MARE introduces a forgery disentanglement module to capture intrinsic forgery traces from high-level facial semantics, thereby improving its authenticity detection capability. We conduct thorough evaluations on the reasoning content generated by MARE. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that MARE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and reliability.

TL;DR: Proposes training a detector to distinguish AI-generated images by 'contaminating' real images with generator components, achieving high accuracy on unseen generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address poor generalization of existing deepfake detectors to images from unseen generators by leveraging common final architectural components in image generators.

Method: Contaminates real images using generators' final components and trains a detector to distinguish them from originals. Introduces a taxonomy of generators for testing.

Result: Achieves 98.83% average accuracy across 22 testing sets from unseen generators using only 100 samples per category.

Conclusion: The method effectively generalizes to unseen generators, demonstrating high accuracy and potential for trustworthy AI-generated image detection.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of powerful image generators, accurate detection of AI-generated images has become essential for maintaining a trustworthy online environment. However, existing deepfake detectors often generalize poorly to images produced by unseen generators. Notably, despite being trained under vastly different paradigms, such as diffusion or autoregressive modeling, many modern image generators share common final architectural components that serve as the last stage for converting intermediate representations into images. Motivated by this insight, we propose to "contaminate" real images using the generator's final component and train a detector to distinguish them from the original real images. We further introduce a taxonomy based on generators' final components and categorize 21 widely used generators accordingly, enabling a comprehensive investigation of our method's generalization capability. Using only 100 samples from each of three representative categories, our detector-fine-tuned on the DINOv3 backbone-achieves an average accuracy of 98.83% across 22 testing sets from unseen generators.

TL;DR: Proposes 'Dummy Forcing' to optimize autoregressive video diffusion models by reducing redundancy in multi-head self-attention, achieving faster video generation with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the under-utilization of historical frames in autoregressive video diffusion models, noting that many attention heads focus mainly on the current frame, which wastes computational resources.

Method: Introduces Dummy Forcing, which includes heterogeneous memory allocation to reduce redundancy, dynamic head programming to classify heads, and context packing for cache compression.

Result: Achieves up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, enabling 24.3 FPS video generation with less than 0.5% quality drop, without additional training.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves efficiency in autoregressive video diffusion models by optimizing attention head usage and cache compression, offering practical benefits for real-time applications.

Abstract: The autoregressive video diffusion model has recently gained considerable research interest due to its causal modeling and iterative denoising. In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models were trained to segment and differentiate WMH and ISL using partially labelled data, with pseudolabels yielding the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiating WMH and ISL in MRI scans is challenging due to their visual confounding in FLAIR sequences, leading to the need for effective segmentation models.

Method: Six training strategies were investigated using partially labelled data from combined private and public datasets totaling 2052 MRI volumes.

Result: Pseudolabeling emerged as the most effective method for leveraging partially labelled data to improve segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that pseudolabeling can effectively enhance the training of deep learning models for segmenting WMH and ISL in MRI scans.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) and ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL) are imaging features associated with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) that are visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The development and validation of deep learning models to segment and differentiate these features is difficult because they visually confound each other in the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and often appear in the same subject. We investigated six strategies for training a combined WMH and ISL segmentation model using partially labelled data. We combined privately held fully and partially labelled datasets with publicly available partially labelled datasets to yield a total of 2052 MRI volumes, with 1341 and 1152 containing ground truth annotations for WMH and ISL respectively. We found that several methods were able to effectively leverage the partially labelled data to improve model performance, with the use of pseudolabels yielding the best result.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Latent Temporal Discrepancy (LTD) as a motion prior to improve video generation quality in dynamic scenarios by weighting losses based on frame-to-frame variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models struggle with drastic dynamic changes due to noise disrupting temporal coherence and static loss constraints.

Method: Introduces LTD, a motion-aware loss weighting strategy that measures latent space frame-to-frame variation to prioritize dynamic regions.

Result: Significant improvements on VBench (3.31%) and VMBench (3.58%), showcasing better motion quality.

Conclusion: LTD effectively enhances dynamic video generation by stabilizing training and improving high-frequency dynamics reconstruction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved notable progress in static scenarios, yet their performance in motion video generation remains limited, with quality degrading under drastic dynamic changes. This is due to noise disrupting temporal coherence and increasing the difficulty of learning dynamic regions. {Unfortunately, existing diffusion models rely on static loss for all scenarios, constraining their ability to capture complex dynamics.} To address this issue, we introduce Latent Temporal Discrepancy (LTD) as a motion prior to guide loss weighting. LTD measures frame-to-frame variation in the latent space, assigning larger penalties to regions with higher discrepancy while maintaining regular optimization for stable regions. This motion-aware strategy stabilizes training and enables the model to better reconstruct high-frequency dynamics. Extensive experiments on the general benchmark VBench and the motion-focused VMBench show consistent gains, with our method outperforming strong baselines by 3.31% on VBench and 3.58% on VMBench, achieving significant improvements in motion quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meeting user demand for intuitive, high-quality portrait collections on social media platforms.

Result: SCheese achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent portrait collections.

Conclusion: CHEESE and SCheese effectively address PCG challenges, advancing the field.

Abstract: As social media platforms proliferate, users increasingly demand intuitive ways to create diverse, high-quality portrait collections. In this work, we introduce Portrait Collection Generation (PCG), a novel task that generates coherent portrait collections by editing a reference portrait image through natural language instructions. This task poses two unique challenges to existing methods: (1) complex multi-attribute modifications such as pose, spatial layout, and camera viewpoint; and (2) high-fidelity detail preservation including identity, clothing, and accessories. To address these challenges, we propose CHEESE, the first large-scale PCG dataset containing 24K portrait collections and 573K samples with high-quality modification text annotations, constructed through an Large Vison-Language Model-based pipeline with inversion-based verification. We further propose SCheese, a framework that combines text-guided generation with hierarchical identity and detail preservation. SCheese employs adaptive feature fusion mechanism to maintain identity consistency, and ConsistencyNet to inject fine-grained features for detail consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CHEESE in advancing PCG, with SCheese achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoTA, a method to mitigate repetitive text generation in diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Models (dMLLMs) caused by caching. It analyzes repetition through information flow and proposes a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the 'Repeat Curse' in dMLLMs, where caching leads to undesirable repetitive outputs, by understanding the underlying information flow mechanisms.

Method: Analyzes repetition via information flow, identifies three key findings, and proposes CoTA—a plug-and-play method enhancing context token attention and penalizing uncertain outputs.

Result: CoTA effectively reduces repetition and improves performance on general tasks.

Conclusion: CoTA successfully addresses repetition in dMLLMs by preserving information flow and refining decoding confidence, validated through experiments.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Models (dMLLMs) suffer from high inference latency and therefore rely on caching techniques to accelerate decoding. However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

TL;DR: AnomalyVFM is a framework that transforms pretrained vision foundation models into strong zero-shot anomaly detectors, outperforming current methods by 3.3 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods based on vision foundation models lag behind vision-language models due to limited dataset diversity and shallow adaptation strategies.

Method: AnomalyVFM uses a three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme and parameter-efficient adaptation with low-rank feature adapters and confidence-weighted pixel loss.

Result: With RADIO as the backbone, AnomalyVFM achieves a 94.1% average image-level AUROC across 9 datasets.

Conclusion: AnomalyVFM effectively addresses the limitations of current VFM-based approaches, setting a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot anomaly detection.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection aims to detect and localise abnormal regions in the image without access to any in-domain training images. While recent approaches leverage vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to transfer high-level concept knowledge, methods based on purely vision foundation models (VFMs), like DINOv2, have lagged behind in performance. We argue that this gap stems from two practical issues: (i) limited diversity in existing auxiliary anomaly detection datasets and (ii) overly shallow VFM adaptation strategies. To address both challenges, we propose AnomalyVFM, a general and effective framework that turns any pretrained VFM into a strong zero-shot anomaly detector. Our approach combines a robust three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme with a parameter-efficient adaptation mechanism, utilising low-rank feature adapters and a confidence-weighted pixel loss. Together, these components enable modern VFMs to substantially outperform current state-of-the-art methods. More specifically, with RADIO as a backbone, AnomalyVFM achieves an average image-level AUROC of 94.1% across 9 diverse datasets, surpassing previous methods by significant 3.3 percentage points.

TL;DR: The paper proposes IOTA, a framework combining data-driven Black Box and knowledge-driven White Box modules for better downstream task adaptation by leveraging corrective knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods underutilize pre-trained models' prior knowledge, limiting their adaptation potential. IOTA aims to integrate both data- and knowledge-driven signals for improved performance.

Method: IOTA uses a White Box module to derive corrective knowledge from wrong predictions and verbalize it into prompts. A knowledge-guided prompt selection strategy then guides the Black Box module.

Result: Experiments on 12 image classification benchmarks show IOTA's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in few-shot and easy-to-hard adaptation settings.

Conclusion: IOTA effectively combines knowledge- and data-driven learning, demonstrating the value of corrective knowledge for downstream task adaptation.

Abstract: Recently, adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks has attracted increasing interest. Previous Parameter-Efficient-Tuning (PET) methods regard the pre-trained model as an opaque Black Box model, relying purely on data-driven optimization and underutilizing their inherent prior knowledge. This oversight limits the models' potential for effective downstream task adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel black-whIte bOx prompT leArning framework (IOTA), which integrates a data-driven Black Box module with a knowledge-driven White Box module for downstream task adaptation. Specifically, the White Box module derives corrective knowledge by contrasting the wrong predictions with the right cognition. This knowledge is verbalized into interpretable human prompts and leveraged through a corrective knowledge-guided prompt selection strategy to guide the Black Box module toward more accurate predictions. By jointly leveraging knowledge- and data-driven learning signals, IOTA achieves effective downstream task adaptation. Experimental results on 12 image classification benchmarks under few-shot and easy-to-hard adaptation settings demonstrate the effectiveness of corrective knowledge and the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: DeepSeek-OCR 2 introduces DeepEncoder V2, which dynamically reorders visual tokens based on image semantics, mimicking human visual perception for better 2D image understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs process visual tokens rigidly, unlike human perception, which follows semantically coherent patterns. This work aims to bridge that gap.

Method: DeepEncoder V2 reorders visual tokens using causal reasoning before feeding them into LLMs, exploring a cascaded 1D reasoning approach for 2D understanding.

Result: The model offers a novel architectural approach for genuine 2D reasoning, with publicly available codes and weights.

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR 2 demonstrates the feasibility of dynamic token reordering for improved image understanding, inspired by human cognition.

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR 2 to investigate the feasibility of a novel encoder-DeepEncoder V2-capable of dynamically reordering visual tokens upon image semantics. Conventional vision-language models (VLMs) invariably process visual tokens in a rigid raster-scan order (top-left to bottom-right) with fixed positional encoding when fed into LLMs. However, this contradicts human visual perception, which follows flexible yet semantically coherent scanning patterns driven by inherent logical structures. Particularly for images with complex layouts, human vision exhibits causally-informed sequential processing. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation. This work explores a novel paradigm: whether 2D image understanding can be effectively achieved through two-cascaded 1D causal reasoning structures, thereby offering a new architectural approach with the potential to achieve genuine 2D reasoning.

TL;DR: DiffVC-RT is a real-time diffusion-based neural video compression framework addressing challenges like information loss, latency, and temporal inconsistency. It achieves 80.1% bitrate savings over VTM-17.0 with real-time speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient diffusion-based neural video compression solutions due to existing issues like severe information loss, high latency, and poor temporal consistency.

Method: Introduces an efficient model architecture, explicit/implicit consistency modeling for temporal stability, and an asynchronous parallel decoding pipeline with mixed half precision.

Result: Achieves 80.1% bitrate savings over VTM-17.0 on HEVC dataset with 206/30 fps encoding/decoding speeds for 720p videos.

Conclusion: DiffVC-RT marks a significant advancement in real-time diffusion-based video compression with high efficiency and consistency.

Abstract: The practical deployment of diffusion-based Neural Video Compression (NVC) faces critical challenges, including severe information loss, prohibitive inference latency, and poor temporal consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose DiffVC-RT, the first framework designed to achieve real-time diffusion-based perceptual NVC. First, we introduce an Efficient and Informative Model Architecture. Through strategic module replacements and pruning, this architecture significantly reduces computational complexity while mitigating structural information loss. Second, to address generative flickering artifacts, we propose Explicit and Implicit Consistency Modeling. We enhance temporal consistency by explicitly incorporating a zero-cost Online Temporal Shift Module within the U-Net, complemented by hybrid implicit consistency constraints. Finally, we present an Asynchronous and Parallel Decoding Pipeline incorporating Mixed Half Precision, which enables asynchronous latent decoding and parallel frame reconstruction via a Batch-dimension Temporal Shift design. Experiments show that DiffVC-RT achieves 80.1% bitrate savings in terms of LPIPS over VTM-17.0 on HEVC dataset with real-time encoding and decoding speeds of 206 / 30 fps for 720p videos on an NVIDIA H800 GPU, marking a significant milestone in diffusion-based video compression.

*Shaokun Wang,Weili Guan,Jizhou Han,Jianlong Wu,Yupeng Hu,Liqiang Nie*

TL;DR: StructAlign addresses catastrophic forgetting in Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) by using a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry and cross-modal losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTVR faces challenges like feature drift (intra-modal and cross-modal) leading to catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes StructAlign with ETF geometry for alignment and Cross-modal Relation Preserving loss for intra-modal stability.

Result: StructAlign outperforms state-of-the-art continual retrieval methods.

Conclusion: StructAlign effectively mitigates feature drift and catastrophic forgetting in CTVR.

Abstract: Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) is a challenging multimodal continual learning setting, where models must incrementally learn new semantic categories while maintaining accurate text-video alignment for previously learned ones, thus making it particularly prone to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge in CTVR is feature drift, which manifests in two forms: intra-modal feature drift caused by continual learning within each modality, and non-cooperative feature drift across modalities that leads to modality misalignment. To mitigate these issues, we propose StructAlign, a structured cross-modal alignment method for CTVR. First, StructAlign introduces a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry as a unified geometric prior to mitigate modality misalignment. Building upon this geometric prior, we design a cross-modal ETF alignment loss that aligns text and video features with category-level ETF prototypes, encouraging the learned representations to form an approximate simplex ETF geometry. In addition, to suppress intra-modal feature drift, we design a Cross-modal Relation Preserving loss, which leverages complementary modalities to preserve cross-modal similarity relations, providing stable relational supervision for feature updates. By jointly addressing non-cooperative feature drift across modalities and intra-modal feature drift, StructAlign effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting in CTVR. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art continual retrieval approaches.

*Lakshman Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates ReID models' robustness across domains, comparing supervised, self-supervised, and language-aligned paradigms. Language-aligned models show strong cross-domain performance despite not being explicitly trained for ReID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the generalization of ReID models in cross-domain scenarios and explore the impact of foundation models like SigLIP2 on improving transferable visual representations.

Method: The study compares three training paradigms (supervised, self-supervised, language-aligned) across 11 models and 9 datasets, analyzing their cross-domain performance.

Result: Supervised models excel in their training domain but fail cross-domain, while language-aligned models demonstrate unexpected robustness in cross-domain ReID tasks.

Conclusion: Language-aligned foundation models offer promising generalization capabilities for ReID, highlighting their potential despite not being explicitly designed for the task.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) remains a challenging problem in computer vision. This work reviews various training paradigm and evaluates the robustness of state-of-the-art ReID models in cross-domain applications and examines the role of foundation models in improving generalization through richer, more transferable visual representations. We compare three training paradigms, supervised, self-supervised, and language-aligned models. Through the study the aim is to answer the following questions: Can supervised models generalize in cross-domain scenarios? How does foundation models like SigLIP2 perform for the ReID tasks? What are the weaknesses of current supervised and foundational models for ReID? We have conducted the analysis across 11 models and 9 datasets. Our results show a clear split: supervised models dominate their training domain but crumble on cross-domain data. Language-aligned models, however, show surprising robustness cross-domain for ReID tasks, even though they are not explicitly trained to do so.

*Zhuonan Wang,Wenjie Yan,Wenqiao Zhang,Xiaohui Song,Jian Ma,Ke Yao,Yibo Yu,Beng Chin Ooi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLEAR-Mamba improves medical image classification by enhancing MedMamba with adaptive layers and reliability-aware training, validated on a large ophthalmic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with generalization and high-confidence predictions due to single-modality limitations and variability in medical images.

Method: Proposes CLEAR-Mamba with HaC (adaptive conditioning layer) and RaP (reliability-aware prediction) for better cross-domain adaptability and model reliability.

Result: Outperforms baselines, especially in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction.

Conclusion: CLEAR-Mamba balances generalizability and reliability for modality-specific medical image tasks.

Abstract: Medical image classification is a core task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), playing a pivotal role in early disease detection, treatment planning, and patient prognosis assessment. In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction. This study provides an effective solution that balances generalizability and reliability for modality-specific medical image classification tasks.

*Shuguang Zhang,Junhong Lian,Guoxin Yu,Baoxun Xu,Xiang Ao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDCNet improves MSD by using MLLMs for stable semantic anchors, measuring discrepancies, and adaptively balancing modalities, achieving top performance on MMSD2.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MSD methods struggle with loosely related or indirect image-text pairs and noisy sarcastic cues from LLMs. GDCNet addresses these issues.

Method: Uses MLLMs to generate factually grounded captions, computes semantic/sentiment discrepancies, and fuses features via a gated module for balanced modality contributions.

Result: Outperforms benchmarks on MSD tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art on MMSD2.0.

Conclusion: GDCNet effectively handles semantic incongruities in MSD by leveraging stable semantic anchors and adaptive fusion, proving robust and accurate.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify sarcasm within image-text pairs by modeling semantic incongruities across modalities. Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.

*Jing Wu,Daphne Barretto,Yiye Chen,Nicholas Gydé,Yanan Jian,Yuhang He,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OS-Marathon, a benchmark for evaluating agents on long-horizon, repetitive tasks, and proposes a cost-effective method for teaching agents the underlying logic using few-shot examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon, repetitive tasks are tedious for humans but ideal for computer-use agents (CUAs). The absence of an evaluation benchmark hinders progress in this area, prompting the creation of OS-Marathon.

Method: The authors establish OS-Marathon with 242 tasks across 2 domains and introduce a method to construct condensed demonstrations using few-shot examples to teach agents workflow logic.

Result: Experiments show the challenges of these tasks and the effectiveness of the proposed method in enabling agents to execute workflows on larger, unseen data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of CUAs for repetitive tasks and provides a benchmark and method to advance agent performance in this domain.

Abstract: Long-horizon, repetitive workflows are common in professional settings, such as processing expense reports from receipts and entering student grades from exam papers. These tasks are often tedious for humans since they can extend to extreme lengths proportional to the size of the data to process. However, they are ideal for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) due to their structured, recurring sub-workflows with logic that can be systematically learned. Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the inherent challenges of these tasks and the effectiveness of our proposed method. Project website: https://os-marathon.github.io/.

*Michele Mazzamuto,Daniele Di Mauro,Gianpiero Francesca,Giovanni Maria Farinella,Antonino Furnari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProSkill is a new benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural videos, addressing gaps in existing research by providing both absolute and pairwise annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing skill assessment research focuses on sports and lacks large-scale datasets for procedural tasks, often limited to binary or pairwise labels.

Method: Introduces ProSkill with a scalable annotation protocol using Swiss Tournament pairings and ELO-based scoring for consistent global rankings.

Result: Benchmarks show current state-of-the-art algorithms perform suboptimally, highlighting ProSkill's value.

Conclusion: ProSkill fills a critical gap and sets a new standard for procedural video skill assessment.

Abstract: Skill assessment in procedural videos is crucial for the objective evaluation of human performance in settings such as manufacturing and procedural daily tasks. Current research on skill assessment has predominantly focused on sports and lacks large-scale datasets for complex procedural activities. Existing studies typically involve only a limited number of actions, focus on either pairwise assessments (e.g., A is better than B) or on binary labels (e.g., good execution vs needs improvement). In response to these shortcomings, we introduce ProSkill, the first benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural tasks. ProSkill provides absolute skill assessment annotations, along with pairwise ones. This is enabled by a novel and scalable annotation protocol that allows for the creation of an absolute skill assessment ranking starting from pairwise assessments. This protocol leverages a Swiss Tournament scheme for efficient pairwise comparisons, which are then aggregated into consistent, continuous global scores using an ELO-based rating system. We use our dataset to benchmark the main state-of-the-art skill assessment algorithms, including both ranking-based and pairwise paradigms. The suboptimal results achieved by the current state-of-the-art highlight the challenges and thus the value of ProSkill in the context of skill assessment for procedural videos.

*Pankhi Kashyap,Mainak Singha,Biplab Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiMoRS introduces a bi-modal prompt learning framework for remote sensing tasks, leveraging textual summaries and visual features to improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods struggle with remote sensing imagery due to challenges like multi-label scenes and high intra-class variability.

Method: BiMoRS uses frozen image captioning and BERT tokenization to fuse textual summaries with CLIP visual features, guided by a cross-attention module.

Result: BiMoRS outperforms baselines by up to 2% on average across four remote sensing datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in remote sensing by combining textual and visual cues.

Abstract: Prompt learning (PL) has emerged as an effective strategy to adapt vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for downstream tasks under limited supervision. While PL has demonstrated strong generalization on natural image datasets, its transferability to remote sensing (RS) imagery remains underexplored. RS data present unique challenges, including multi-label scenes, high intra-class variability, and diverse spatial resolutions, that hinder the direct applicability of existing PL methods. In particular, current prompt-based approaches often struggle to identify dominant semantic cues and fail to generalize to novel classes in RS scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose BiMoRS, a lightweight bi-modal prompt learning framework tailored for RS tasks. BiMoRS employs a frozen image captioning model (e.g., BLIP-2) to extract textual semantic summaries from RS images. These captions are tokenized using a BERT tokenizer and fused with high-level visual features from the CLIP encoder. A lightweight cross-attention module then conditions a learnable query prompt on the fused textual-visual representation, yielding contextualized prompts without altering the CLIP backbone. We evaluate BiMoRS on four RS datasets across three domain generalization (DG) tasks and observe consistent performance gains, outperforming strong baselines by up to 2% on average.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEAF is a label-efficient framework for image quality assessment (IQA) that reduces the need for extensive human annotations by distilling perceptual quality priors from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) teacher into a lightweight student regressor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind LEAF is to address the computational expense and reliance on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations in adapting large-scale MLLMs for IQA tasks, focusing instead on MOS scale calibration.

Method: LEAF employs a teacher-student distillation approach. The MLLM teacher provides dense supervision via point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, estimating decision reliability. The lightweight student regressor then learns these quality perception patterns and is calibrated on a small MOS subset.

Result: Experiments on user-generated and AI-generated IQA benchmarks show that LEAF significantly reduces human annotation requirements while maintaining strong MOS-aligned correlations.

Conclusion: LEAF makes lightweight IQA practical under limited annotation budgets by efficiently leveraging MLLM capabilities and minimizing human supervision.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in image quality assessment (IQA) tasks. However, adapting such large-scale models is computationally expensive and still relies on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations. We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability. Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations. Experiments on both user-generated and AI-generated IQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the need for human annotations while maintaining strong MOS-aligned correlations, making lightweight IQA practical under limited annotation budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored performance of MLLMs on long-form, structured educational content, particularly STEM lectures requiring cross-modal integration and long-horizon reasoning.

Method: Introduces LEMON, a benchmark with 2,277 video segments from 5 disciplines, 29 courses, and 4,181 QA pairs (multiple-choice and open-ended). It emphasizes semantic richness, tightly coupled modalities, temporal/pedagogical structure, and multi-turn questioning.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o show significant performance gaps, especially in temporal reasoning and instructional prediction.

Conclusion: LEMON serves as a challenging, extensible benchmark to advance multimodal understanding in long-form instructional content, revealing areas needing improvement in MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress across vision, audio, and language tasks, yet their performance on long-form, knowledge-intensive, and temporally structured educational content remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LEMON, a Lecture-based Evaluation benchmark for MultimOdal uNderstanding, focusing on STEM lecture videos that require long-horizon reasoning and cross-modal integration. LEMON comprises 2,277 video segments spanning 5 disciplines and 29 courses, with an average duration of 196.1 seconds, yielding 4,181 high-quality QA pairs, including 3,413 multiple-choice and 768 open-ended questions. Distinct from existing video benchmarks, LEMON features: (1) semantic richness and disciplinary density, (2) tightly coupled video-audio-text modalities, (3) explicit temporal and pedagogical structure, and (4) contextually linked multi-turn questioning. It further encompasses six major tasks and twelve subtasks, covering the full cognitive spectrum from perception to reasoning and then to generation. Comprehensive experiments reveal substantial performance gaps across tasks, highlighting that even state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o struggle with temporal reasoning and instructional prediction. We expect LEMON to serve as an extensible and challenging benchmark for advancing multimodal perception, reasoning, and generation in long-form instructional contents.

*Matej Halinkovic,Nina Masarykova,Alexey Vinel,Marek Galinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Li-ViP3D++ is a query-based multimodal framework for autonomous driving that integrates cameras and LiDAR efficiently using Query-Gated Deformable Fusion, improving perception, prediction, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modular pipelines for autonomous driving suffer from restricted information flow and amplified errors. Existing query-based models lack efficient camera-LiDAR fusion, often using heuristic alignment that introduces bias.

Method: Li-ViP3D++ employs Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to merge RGB and LiDAR data in query space. It aggregates image evidence, extracts LiDAR context, and uses adaptive gating to weigh cues per agent.

Result: On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ achieves higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502), reduces false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and is faster (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms) than its predecessor.

Conclusion: Fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion in query space enhances end-to-end perception-and-prediction robustness without compromising deployability.

Abstract: End-to-end perception and trajectory prediction from raw sensor data is one of the key capabilities for autonomous driving. Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.

Motivation: To investigate how compression efficiency correlates with AI performance, specifically in multimodal LLMs, and to bridge the gap between traditional visual coding and emerging vision token technology.

Method: Provides an overview of visual coding and vision token technology, unifies them through optimization, and synthesizes insights to forecast future techniques.

Result: Demonstrates the potential of task-oriented tokens in practical AI applications and suggests future standardization of general token technology.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of compression efficiency in AI performance and proposes a unified framework for next-gen visual codecs and token techniques.

Abstract: "Compression Tells Intelligence", is supported by research in artificial intelligence, particularly concerning (multimodal) large language models (LLMs/MLLMs), where compression efficiency often correlates with improved model performance and capabilities. For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.

TL;DR: FairT2V is a training-free framework to mitigate gender bias in text-to-video models by neutralizing prompt embeddings and preserving semantic coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demographic biases, especially gender bias, in text-to-video diffusion models are unexplored despite rapid progress. FairT2V addresses encoder-induced bias without requiring finetuning.

Method: FairT2V neutralizes prompt embeddings using anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations and applies debiasing during early identity-forming steps for temporal coherence.

Result: Experiments on Open-Sora show FairT2V significantly reduces demographic bias across occupations while minimally affecting video quality.

Conclusion: FairT2V effectively mitigates encoder-induced bias in text-to-video generation, offering a practical solution without compromising video quality.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have achieved rapid progress, yet their demographic biases, particularly gender bias, remain largely unexplored. We present FairT2V, a training-free debiasing framework for text-to-video generation that mitigates encoder-induced bias without finetuning. We first analyze demographic bias in T2V models and show that it primarily originates from pretrained text encoders, which encode implicit gender associations even for neutral prompts. We quantify this effect with a gender-leaning score that correlates with bias in generated videos.
  Based on this insight, FairT2V mitigates demographic bias by neutralizing prompt embeddings via anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations while preserving semantics. To maintain temporal coherence, we apply debiasing only during early identity-forming steps through a dynamic denoising schedule. We further propose a video-level fairness evaluation protocol combining VideoLLM-based reasoning with human verification. Experiments on the modern T2V model Open-Sora show that FairT2V substantially reduces demographic bias across occupations with minimal impact on video quality.

TL;DR: FunHSI is a training-free framework for generating functionally correct 3D human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary prompts, addressing the lack of explicit reasoning in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enable plausible and functionally correct interactions between 3D humans and scenes for applications in AI, robotics, and interactive content creation, overcoming limitations of current methods.

Method: FunHSI uses functionality-aware contact reasoning, leverages vision-language models for pose synthesis, and refines poses via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness.

Result: FunHSI generates more plausible and fine-grained human-scene interactions compared to existing methods, as validated by experiments across diverse scenes.

Conclusion: FunHSI effectively addresses the challenge of creating functionally correct 3D human-scene interactions, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Generating 3D humans that functionally interact with 3D scenes remains an open problem with applications in embodied AI, robotics, and interactive content creation. The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as "sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., "increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal framework combining images and inertial measurements for robust road surface classification, alongside a new diverse dataset (ROAD), outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing road surface classification techniques lack generalization due to limited sensing and dataset diversity. The work aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module and adaptive gating layer to fuse images and inertial measurements, using the ROAD dataset for validation.

Result: Achieves +1.4 pp and +11.6 pp improvements over benchmarks, with stable performance under challenging conditions like nighttime and rain.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion with affordable sensors provides scalable, robust road surface understanding, especially in variable environments.

Abstract: Road surface classification (RSC) is a key enabler for environment-aware predictive maintenance systems. However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites.

*Hongyu Zhou,Zisen Shao,Sheng Miao,Pan Wang,Dongfeng Bai,Bingbing Liu,Yiyi Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeFix introduces a fine-tuning-free method for novel view synthesis, leveraging pretrained image diffusion models to enhance extrapolated rendering without compromising generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between generalization and fidelity in novel view synthesis, which existing methods struggle with by either overfitting or yielding lower fidelity.

Method: FreeFix uses an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy and a per-pixel confidence mask to leverage image diffusion models for consistent refinement.

Result: FreeFix improves multi-frame consistency and achieves performance comparable to or surpassing fine-tuning-based methods while retaining generalization.

Conclusion: FreeFix successfully balances fidelity and generalization in novel view synthesis without fine-tuning, marking a significant advancement.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have advanced novel view synthesis, yet still rely on dense inputs and often degrade at extrapolated views. Recent approaches leverage generative models, such as diffusion models, to provide additional supervision, but face a trade-off between generalization and fidelity: fine-tuning diffusion models for artifact removal improves fidelity but risks overfitting, while fine-tuning-free methods preserve generalization but often yield lower fidelity. We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models. We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models. Furthermore, we take a closer look at the guidance signal for 2D refinement and propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify uncertain regions for targeted improvement. Experiments across multiple datasets show that FreeFix improves multi-frame consistency and achieves performance comparable to or surpassing fine-tuning-based methods, while retaining strong generalization ability.

### [63] [From Intuition to Expertise: Rubric-Based Cognitive Calibration for Human Detection of LLM-Generated Korean Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19913)
*Shinwoo Park,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores improving expert detection of human-written vs. LLM-generated Korean text using structured calibration (LREAD rubric), showing significant accuracy and agreement improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to distinguish human-written Korean from fluent LLM outputs, even for trained readers. The study investigates if structured calibration can enhance detection skills.

Method: A three-phase longitudinal study with Korean linguistics majors: intuition-only detection (Phase 1), criterion-level scoring with justifications (Phase 2), and domain-focused mastery on held-out essays (Phase 3). The LREAD rubric, derived from Korean writing standards, targets micro-level artifacts.

Result: Majority-vote accuracy improved from 60% to 100%, with inter-annotator agreement rising sharply (Fleiss' kappa: -0.09 to 0.82). Calibrated humans outperformed automated detectors by focusing on language-specific details.

Conclusion: Rubric-scaffolded expert judgment complements automated detectors for non-English contexts. The LREAD rubric and detection signatures taxonomy are released for broader use.

Abstract: Distinguishing human-written Korean text from fluent LLM outputs remains difficult even for linguistically trained readers, who can over-trust surface well-formedness. We study whether expert detection can be treated as a learnable skill and improved through structured calibration. We introduce LREAD, a rubric derived from national Korean writing standards and adapted to target micro-level artifacts (e.g., punctuation optionality, spacing behavior, and register shifts). In a three-phase longitudinal blind protocol with Korean linguistics majors, Phase 1 measures intuition-only detection, Phase 2 enforces criterion-level scoring with explicit justifications, and Phase 3 evaluates domain-focused mastery on held-out elementary essays. Across phases, majority-vote accuracy increases from 60% to 100%, accompanied by stronger inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa: -0.09 --> 0.82). Compared to state-of-the-art LLM detectors, calibrated humans rely more on language-specific micro-diagnostics that are not well captured by coarse discourse priors. Our findings suggest that rubric-scaffolded expert judgment can serve as an interpretable complement to automated detectors for non-English settings, and we release the full rubric and a taxonomy of calibrated detection signatures.

*Maxwell Crouse,Ibrahim Abdelaziz,Kshitij Fadnis,Siva Sankalp Patel,Kinjal Basu,Chulaka Gunasekara,Sadhana Kumaravel,Asim Munawar,Pavan Kapanipathi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiGiT-TC introduces a synthetic data generation method for multi-turn tool calling conversations without relying on stateful execution environments, addressing gaps in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks assume stateful execution environments for validating tool calling interactions, which isn't feasible in many real-world scenarios like enterprise settings with strict data security.

Method: DiGiT-TC generates synthetic tool calling conversations mimicking stateful environment characteristics by implicitly representing tool calls in user requests.

Result: The method shows strong performance gains on standard benchmarks, even in stateful problem settings.

Conclusion: DiGiT-TC effectively bridges the gap for generating valid synthetic data in stateless tool calling scenarios.

Abstract: Synthetic data has proven itself to be a valuable resource for tuning smaller, cost-effective language models to handle the complexities of multi-turn tool calling conversations. While many frameworks and systems for producing synthetic multi-turn tool calling data have been proposed, prior works have frequently assumed that any tool calling interactions will take place in an execution environment that maintains state. When such an environment is available, this is advantageous as it allows for the validity of an interaction to be determined by whether or not the state of the execution environment matches to some prespecified objective. Unfortunately, this does not hold in many real-world tool use settings, e.g., in enterprise settings where data security is of the utmost importance or in cases where tool specifications are synthesized from multiple sources. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a data generation method, DiGiT-TC, that is designed to produce tool calling conversations that have the characteristics of conversations generated through search in a stateful environment. The key to our technique lies in a novel generation pattern that allows our approach to implicitly represent certain tool calls in the user request. We validate our approach on standard tool calling benchmarks and demonstrate that, even in stateful problem settings, our approach results in strong performance gains.

*Paul Tarau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Arrow Language Model introduces a neural architecture inspired by intuitionistic logic, using left-nested implication chains for token prediction and sequence processing as constructive proof extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to derive neural architectures from logic-based principles, specifically intuitionistic implicational logic, offering alternatives to transformer-based models.

Method: The method involves encoding prefixes as left-nested implication chains, validating properties via Prolog-based theorem provers, and comparing commutative vs. non-commutative sequencing.

Result: A neural architecture akin to multiplicative RNNs emerges naturally, validated by theorem provers and positioned relative to Transformers and state-space models.

Conclusion: The Arrow Language Model provides a logic-driven alternative to conventional neural architectures, bridging proof theory and token prediction.

Abstract: We introduce the \emph{Arrow Language Model}, a neural architecture derived from an intuitionistic-logic interpretation of next-token prediction. Instead of representing tokens as additive embeddings mixed by attention, we encode a prefix as a \emph{left-nested implication chain} whose structure preserves order through non-commutative composition. Next-token prediction corresponds to \emph{modus ponens}, and sequence processing becomes constructive proof extension under the Curry--Howard correspondence. Our Prolog-based specialized theorem provers validate fundamental properties of the neural models, among which relations between commutative vs. non-commutative sequencing and single-token vs. multi-token prediction choices. We show that a neural architecture equivalent to multiplicative RNNs arises naturally from a proof-theoretic interpretation of next-token prediction as nested intuitionistic implication, we present a practical low-rank neural realization and position the model relative to Transformers and state-space models.
  Keywords: logic-based derivation of neural architectures, intuitionistic implicational logic, token-as-operator neural models, state-space models, alternatives to transformer-based foundational models.

*Sara Candussio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thesis proposes a dialectic pipeline for LLMs to self-reflect and correct answers, outperforming standard methods and Chain-of-Thought prompting without losing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLM hallucinations and improve output quality without domain-specific fine-tuning or verifier training, which are resource-intensive and limiting.

Method: Introduces a dialectic pipeline enabling LLMs to self-reflect and correct answers, tested across datasets and model families with context enrichment (oracle-RAG).

Result: Dialectic pipeline significantly outperforms standard model answers and Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently.

Conclusion: Dialectic pipeline enhances LLM answer quality and correctness while maintaining generalization, offering a scalable alternative to resource-heavy methods.

Abstract: Assessing ways in which Language Models can reduce their hallucinations and improve the outputs' quality is crucial to ensure their large-scale use.
  However, methods such as fine-tuning on domain-specific data or the training of a separate \textit{ad hoc} verifier require demanding computational resources (not feasible for many user applications) and constrain the models to specific fields of knowledge.
  In this thesis, we propose a dialectic pipeline that preserves LLMs' generalization abilities while improving the quality of its answer via self-dialogue, enabling it to reflect upon and correct tentative wrong answers.
  We experimented with different pipeline settings, testing our proposed method on different datasets and on different families of models. All the pipeline stages are enriched with the relevant context (in an oracle-RAG setting) and a study on the impact of its summarization or its filtering is conducted.
  We find that our proposed dialectic pipeline is able to outperform by significative margins the standard model answers and that it consistently achieves higher performances than Chain-of-Thought only prompting.

*Songjun Tu,Yiwen Ma,Jiahao Lin,Qichao Zhang,Xiangyuan Lan,Junfeng. Li,Nan Xu,Linjing Li,Dongbin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PaperAudit-Bench introduces a dataset and framework for improving critical rigor in automated peer reviews by detecting subtle errors and generating evidence-aware assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often lack critical rigor in peer reviews for subtle, distributed errors. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: Developed PaperAudit-Bench with two components: PaperAudit-Dataset (error dataset) and PaperAudit-Review (automated review framework integrating error detection and evidence-aware generation).

Result: Experiments show variability in error detection across models and depths. Explicit error detection improves review quality, and the dataset supports lightweight LLM training.

Conclusion: PaperAudit-Bench enhances automated peer reviews by addressing critical rigor issues and enabling efficient error detection.

Abstract: Large language models can generate fluent peer reviews, yet their assessments often lack sufficient critical rigor when substantive issues are subtle and distributed across a paper. In this paper, we introduce PaperAudit-Bench, which consists of two components: (1) PaperAudit-Dataset, an error dataset covering both errors identifiable within individual sections and those requiring cross-section reasoning, designed for controlled evaluation under long-context settings; and (2) PaperAudit-Review, an automated review framework that integrates structured error detection with evidence-aware review generation to support critical assessment. Experiments on PaperAudit-Bench reveal large variability in error detectability across models and detection depths, highlighting the difficulty of identifying such errors under long-context settings. Relative to representative automated reviewing baselines, incorporating explicit error detection into the review workflow produces systematically stricter and more discriminative evaluations, demonstrating its suitability for peer review. Finally, we show that the dataset supports training lightweight LLM detectors via SFT and RL, enabling effective error detection at reduced computational cost.

### [68] [PILOT: Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19917)
*Haoyu Zheng,Yun Zhu,Yuqian Yuan,Bo Yuan,Wenqiao Zhang,Siliang Tang,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PILOT is a lightweight framework that internalizes strategic planning from larger models into compact LLMs via latent guidance, improving reasoning performance without altering backbone weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compact LLMs struggle with global strategic planning in multi-step reasoning tasks, leading to error propagation. External guidance is impractical due to latency and availability constraints.

Method: PILOT uses a Hyper-Network to generate latent guidance vectors conditioned on queries, steering the model's representations toward optimal reasoning paths without modifying backbone weights.

Result: PILOT improves reasoning performance (+8.9% on MATH500) with negligible inference latency, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: PILOT effectively enhances reasoning stability in compact LLMs by internalizing latent guidance, offering a practical solution for long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Strategic planning is critical for multi-step reasoning, yet compact Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the capacity to formulate global strategies, leading to error propagation in long-horizon tasks. Our analysis reveals that LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked when conditioned on explicit plans from a teacher model; however, runtime reliance on external guidance is often impractical due to latency and availability constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose PILOT (Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories), a non-invasive framework designed to internalize the strategic oversight of large models into intrinsic Latent Guidance. Instead of altering backbone weights, PILOT employs a lightweight Hyper-Network to synthesize a query-conditioned Latent Guidance vector. This vector acts as an internal steering mechanism, guiding the model's representations toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on mathematical and coding benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT effectively stabilizes reasoning trajectories, consistently outperforming strong baselines (e.g., +8.9% on MATH500) with negligible inference latency.

### [69] [Lowest Span Confidence: A Zero-Shot Metric for Efficient and Black-Box Hallucination Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19918)
*Yitong Qiao,Licheng Pan,Yu Mi,Lei Liu,Yue Shen,Fei Sun,Zhixuan Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new metric, Lowest Span Confidence (LSC), is proposed for efficient hallucination detection in LLMs, requiring only a single forward pass. It outperforms existing methods under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder reliable deployment in high-stakes scenarios, but current detection methods are impractical due to reliance on intensive sampling or inaccessible model states.

Method: LSC uses a sliding window to evaluate joint likelihood of semantically coherent spans, identifying low-confidence regions correlated with factual inconsistency.

Result: LSC consistently outperforms existing zero-shot baselines across SOTA LLMs and benchmarks, even in resource-limited settings.

Conclusion: LSC offers a robust, efficient solution for hallucination detection, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e., the tendency to generate plausible but non-factual content, pose a significant challenge for their reliable deployment in high-stakes environments. However, existing hallucination detection methods generally operate under unrealistic assumptions, i.e., either requiring expensive intensive sampling strategies for consistency checks or white-box LLM states, which are unavailable or inefficient in common API-based scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel efficient zero-shot metric called Lowest Span Confidence (LSC) for hallucination detection under minimal resource assumptions, only requiring a single forward with output probabilities. Concretely, LSC evaluates the joint likelihood of semantically coherent spans via a sliding window mechanism. By identifying regions of lowest marginal confidence across variable-length n-grams, LSC could well capture local uncertainty patterns strongly correlated with factual inconsistency. Importantly, LSC can mitigate the dilution effect of perplexity and the noise sensitivity of minimum token probability, offering a more robust estimate of factual uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and diverse benchmarks show that LSC consistently outperforms existing zero-shot baselines, delivering strong detection performance even under resource-constrained conditions.

*Junseok Lee,Nahoon Kim,Sangyong Lee,Chang-Jae Chun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASKD improves student model generalization by reducing teacher dependence and introduces FastWhisper, a faster and more accurate variant of Whisper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the decline in generalization capacity when students inherit teacher model shortcomings.

Method: Proposes adaptive self-knowledge distillation (ASKD) and distills Whisper into FastWhisper.

Result: FastWhisper achieves a 1.07% lower word error rate and is 5 times faster than Whisper.

Conclusion: ASKD effectively enhances generalization and efficiency in model compression.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is one of the most effective methods for model compression. Previous studies have focused on the student model effectively training the predictive distribution of the teacher model. However, during training, the student model may inherit the shortcomings of the teacher model, which can lead to a decline in generalization capacity. To mitigate this issue, we propose adaptive self-knowledge distillation (ASKD), which dynamically reduces the dependence of the teacher model to improve the self-training capacity, and performs the self-knowledge distillation method to improve the generalization capacity of the student model. We further distill the Whisper model into a smaller variant, called FastWhisper. In our post-training setting, FastWhisper achieved a word error rate of 1.07% lower than the teacher model Whisper, and its relative inference time was 5 times faster.

### [71] [Demystifying Multi-Agent Debate: The Role of Confidence and Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19921)
*Xiaochen Zhu,Caiqi Zhang,Yizhou Chi,Tom Stafford,Nigel Collier,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves multi-agent debate (MAD) for LLMs by introducing diversity-aware initialization and confidence-modulated updates, showing better performance than vanilla MAD and majority vote.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla MAD underperforms despite high computational costs due to lack of diverse viewpoints and calibrated confidence communication. The paper aims to enhance MAD by incorporating these mechanisms.

Method: Proposes two interventions: (1) diversity-aware initialization to ensure a diverse pool of candidate answers, and (2) confidence-modulated debate where agents express calibrated confidence and update based on others' confidence.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results show the proposed methods outperform vanilla MAD and majority vote across six reasoning QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Simple, principled modifications grounded in human deliberation principles significantly enhance MAD effectiveness, bridging human and LLM-based debate.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) is widely used to improve large language model (LLM) performance through test-time scaling, yet recent work shows that vanilla MAD often underperforms simple majority vote despite higher computational cost. Studies show that, under homogeneous agents and uniform belief updates, debate preserves expected correctness and therefore cannot reliably improve outcomes. Drawing on findings from human deliberation and collective decision-making, we identify two key mechanisms missing from vanilla MAD: (i) diversity of initial viewpoints and (ii) explicit, calibrated confidence communication. We propose two lightweight interventions. First, a diversity-aware initialisation that selects a more diverse pool of candidate answers, increasing the likelihood that a correct hypothesis is present at the start of debate. Second, a confidence-modulated debate protocol in which agents express calibrated confidence and condition their updates on others' confidence. We show theoretically that diversity-aware initialisation improves the prior probability of MAD success without changing the underlying update dynamics, while confidence-modulated updates enable debate to systematically drift to the correct hypothesis. Empirically, across six reasoning-oriented QA benchmarks, our methods consistently outperform vanilla MAD and majority vote. Our results connect human deliberation with LLM-based debate and demonstrate that simple, principled modifications can substantially enhance debate effectiveness.

*Laya Iyer,Kriti Aggarwal,Sanmi Koyejo,Gail Heyman,Desmond C. Ong,Subhabrata Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HEART framework compares humans and LLMs on emotional-support conversations using blinded human raters and LLM evaluators, revealing model strengths in empathy but human advantages in nuanced communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs compare to humans in interpersonal emotional-support skills, assessing empathy, tone adjustment, and conflict navigation.

Method: HEART framework evaluates human and model responses through blinded human raters and LLM-as-judge evaluators using a rubric across five dimensions: Human Alignment, Empathic Responsiveness, Attunement, Resonance, and Task-Following.

Result: Frontier models match or exceed average human empathy; humans excel in adaptive reframing and nuanced tone. Human and LLM evaluator preferences align 80% of the time.

Conclusion: HEART identifies supportive dialogue as a distinct capability, showing convergence in evaluation criteria and scaling trends for model affective competence.

Abstract: Supportive conversation depends on skills that go beyond language fluency, including reading emotions, adjusting tone, and navigating moments of resistance, frustration, or distress. Despite rapid progress in language models, we still lack a clear way to understand how their abilities in these interpersonal domains compare to those of humans. We introduce HEART, the first-ever framework that directly compares humans and LLMs on the same multi-turn emotional-support conversations. For each dialogue history, we pair human and model responses and evaluate them through blinded human raters and an ensemble of LLM-as-judge evaluators. All assessments follow a rubric grounded in interpersonal communication science across five dimensions: Human Alignment, Empathic Responsiveness, Attunement, Resonance, and Task-Following. HEART uncovers striking behavioral patterns. Several frontier models approach or surpass the average human responses in perceived empathy and consistency. At the same time, humans maintain advantages in adaptive reframing, tension-naming, and nuanced tone shifts, particularly in adversarial turns. Human and LLM-as-judge preferences align on about 80 percent of pairwise comparisons, matching inter-human agreement, and their written rationales emphasize similar HEART dimensions. This pattern suggests an emerging convergence in the criteria used to assess supportive quality. By placing humans and models on equal footing, HEART reframes supportive dialogue as a distinct capability axis, separable from general reasoning or linguistic fluency. It provides a unified empirical foundation for understanding where model-generated support aligns with human social judgment, where it diverges, and how affective conversational competence scales with model size.

*Boxiang Zhao,Qince Li,Zhonghao Wang,Zelin Cao,Yi Wang,Peng Cheng,Bo Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Table-BiEval, a self-supervised framework to evaluate LLMs' ability to translate natural language into structured formats and tabular data into machine-readable specs, revealing performance variability among models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations lack effective ways to measure structural fidelity in LLM outputs without human intervention, as traditional metrics miss semantic drift in code-like outputs.

Method: The proposed Table-BiEval uses deterministic Intermediate Representations to calculate Content Semantic Accuracy and Normalized Tree Edit Distance, evaluating 15 LLMs on hierarchical and flat table structures.

Result: Results show mid-sized models can outperform larger ones in structural efficiency, with deep recursive nesting being a bottleneck for all models.

Conclusion: Table-BiEval provides a scalable, human-free method to assess LLM performance in structural tasks, addressing gaps in current evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, the capability to faithfully translate natural language into rigorous structured formats-essential for tool invocation-and to convert complex tabular information into machine-readable specifications has become paramount. However, current evaluations lack effective methodologies to measure this structural fidelity without costly human intervention, as traditional text metrics fail to detect semantic drift in code-like outputs. This paper proposes Table-BiEval, a novel approach based on a human-free, self-supervised evaluation framework, to assess LLMs performance quantitatively. By leveraging deterministic Intermediate Representations, our framework calculates Content Semantic Accuracy and Normalized Tree Edit Distance to decouple structure from content. Also, it empirically evaluates 15 state-of-the-art LLMs across dual topological dimensions-hierarchical structures and flat tables. The results reveal substantial variability, highlighting that mid-sized models can surprisingly outperform larger counterparts in structural efficiency and confirming that deep recursive nesting remains a universal bottleneck for current architectures.

TL;DR: OPT-ENGINE is a benchmark framework evaluating LLMs on optimization tasks, revealing performance limits and bottlenecks in automated formulation and problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' boundaries in optimization modeling, especially for complex real-world tasks.

Method: OPT-ENGINE evaluates LLMs on 10 canonical tasks (5 LP and 5 MIP) with scalable difficulty. Empirical study focuses on robustness and bottlenecks.

Result: Tool-integrated reasoning outperforms pure-text reasoning at higher complexity. Automated constraint formulation is the main bottleneck.

Conclusion: Findings guide future LLM development for advanced optimization, emphasizing solver integration and constraint handling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive progress in optimization modeling, fostering a rapid expansion of new methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. However, the boundaries of their capabilities in automated formulation and problem solving remain poorly understood, particularly when extending to complex, real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose OPT-ENGINE, an extensible benchmark framework designed to evaluate LLMs on optimization modeling with controllable and scalable difficulty levels. OPT-ENGINE spans 10 canonical tasks across operations research, with five Linear Programming and five Mixed-Integer Programming. Utilizing OPT-ENGINE, we conduct an extensive study of LLMs' reasoning capabilities, addressing two critical questions: 1.) Do LLMs' performance remain robust when generalizing to out-of-distribution optimization tasks that scale in complexity beyond current benchmark levels? and 2.) At what stage, from problem interpretation to solution generation, do current LLMs encounter the most significant bottlenecks? Our empirical results yield two key insights: first, tool-integrated reasoning with external solvers exhibits significantly higher robustness as task complexity escalates, while pure-text reasoning reaches a ceiling; second, the automated formulation of constraints constitutes the primary performance bottleneck. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing next-generation LLMs for advanced optimization. Our code is publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/OPTEngine}.

TL;DR: LLMs showed moderate to excellent consistency among themselves and fair to moderate agreement with human reviewers, excelling in objective criteria but lagging in subjective aspects, suggesting a complementary role for AI in academic reviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the feasibility and reliability of LLMs like ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5 in evaluating scientific abstracts compared to human reviewers.

Method: 160 abstracts were graded by humans and three LLMs using a rubric. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using ICCs and Bland-Altman plots for agreement and bias.

Result: LLMs achieved good-to-excellent internal agreement (ICCs: 0.59-0.87) and moderate agreement with humans (~0.45-0.60). Gemini struggled with subjective criteria, while all LLMs showed negligible mean score differences from humans.

Conclusion: LLMs can consistently evaluate abstracts and assist in objective criteria but are weaker in subjective dimensions, emphasizing the need for human oversight.

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLMs) can process requests and generate texts, but their feasibility for assessing complex academic content needs further investigation. To explore LLM's potential in assisting scientific review, this study examined ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5's consistency and reliability in evaluating abstracts compared to one another and to human reviewers. Methods: 160 abstracts from a local conference were graded by human reviewers and three LLMs using one rubric. Composite score distributions across three LLMs and fourteen reviewers were examined. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for within-AI reliability and AI-human concordance. Bland-Altman plots were examined for visual agreement patterns and systematic bias. Results: LLMs achieved good-to-excellent agreement with each other (ICCs: 0.59-0.87). ChatGPT and Claude reached moderate agreement with human reviewers on overall quality and content-specific criteria, with ICCs ~.45-.60 for composite, impression, clarity, objective, and results. They exhibited fair agreement on subjective dimensions, with ICC ranging from 0.23-0.38 for impact, engagement, and applicability. Gemini showed fair agreement on half criteria and no reliability on impact and applicability. Three LLMs showed acceptable or negligible mean difference (ChatGPT=0.24, Gemini=0.42, Claude=-0.02) from the human mean composite scores. Discussion: LLMs could process abstracts in batches with moderate agreement with human experts on overall quality and objective criteria. With appropriate process architecture, they can apply a rubric consistently across volumes of abstracts exceeding feasibility for a human rater. The weaker performance on subjective dimensions indicates that AI should serve a complementary role in evaluation, while human expertise remains essential.

TL;DR: A review of Transformer-based language models' syntactic abilities reveals strong performance on form-oriented tasks but weaker results on syntax-semantics phenomena, highlighting biases toward English and BERT, and suggesting broader research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess the syntactic capabilities of Transformer-based language models systematically, identifying gaps and biases in current research.

Method: The authors reviewed 337 articles, analyzing 1,015 model results across various syntactic phenomena and interpretability methods.

Result: Models excel at form-oriented tasks (e.g., part of speech) but struggle with syntax-semantics interfaces (e.g., binding). The field is biased toward English and BERT.

Conclusion: Future work should improve data reporting, align methods with theory, use mechanistic approaches, and broaden linguistic and empirical scope.

Abstract: We present a systematic review of 337 articles evaluating the syntactic abilities of Transformer-based language models, reporting on 1,015 model results from a range of syntactic phenomena and interpretability methods. Our analysis shows that the state of the art presents a healthy variety of methods and data, but an over-focus on a single language (English), a single model (BERT), and phenomena that are easy to get at (like part of speech and agreement). Results also suggest that TLMs capture these form-oriented phenomena well, but show more variable and weaker performance on phenomena at the syntax-semantics interface, like binding or filler-gap dependencies. We provide recommendations for future work, in particular reporting complete data, better aligning theoretical constructs and methods across studies, increasing the use of mechanistic methods, and broadening the empirical scope regarding languages and linguistic phenomena.

*Yuqing Zhao,Ziyao Liu,Yongsen Zheng,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper surveys attribution-based techniques in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to mitigate hallucinations in LLM-generated responses, proposing a taxonomy, unified pipeline, and comparative analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based QA systems suffer from hallucinations, and while RAG frameworks improve responses, they introduce new hallucination types. A unified understanding of attribution techniques is needed to address these challenges.

Method: The paper outlines a taxonomy of hallucination types in RAG systems, presents a unified pipeline for attribution techniques, reviews techniques targeting specific hallucinations, and analyzes their strengths and weaknesses.

Result: The survey provides a systematic comparison of attribution techniques, identifying their effectiveness against different hallucination types and offering practical guidelines.

Conclusion: This work fills gaps in understanding RAG system hallucinations and attribution techniques, aiding future research and practical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based question answering (QA) systems play a critical role in modern AI, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, LLM-generated responses often suffer from hallucinations, unfaithful statements lacking reliable references. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks enhance LLM responses by incorporating external references but also introduce new forms of hallucination due to complex interactions between the retriever and generator. To address these challenges, researchers have explored attribution-based techniques that ensure responses are verifiably supported by retrieved content. Despite progress, a unified pipeline for these techniques, along with a clear taxonomy and systematic comparison of their strengths and weaknesses, remains lacking. A well-defined taxonomy is essential for identifying specific failure modes within RAG systems, while comparative analysis helps practitioners choose appropriate solutions based on hallucination types and application context. This survey investigates how attribution-based techniques are used within RAG systems to mitigate hallucinations and addresses the gap by: (i) outlining a taxonomy of hallucination types in RAG systems, (ii) presenting a unified pipeline for attribution techniques, (iii) reviewing techniques based on the hallucinations they target, and (iv) discussing strengths and weaknesses with practical guidelines. This work offers insights for future research and practical use of attribution techniques in RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A survey on understanding the internal mechanisms of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) driven by reinforcement learning, covering training dynamics, reasoning mechanisms, and unintended behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the black-box performance of LRMs and mechanistic transparency by exploring their internal workings.

Method: Organizes recent findings into three dimensions: training dynamics, reasoning mechanisms, and unintended behaviors.

Result: Identifies gaps in mechanistic understanding and proposes future directions like applied interpretability and unified theoretical frameworks.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of mechanistic studies for LRMs and outlines a roadmap for future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has catalyzed the emergence of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that have pushed reasoning capabilities to new heights. While their performance has garnered significant excitement, exploring the internal mechanisms driving these behaviors has become an equally critical research frontier. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the mechanistic understanding of LRMs, organizing recent findings into three core dimensions: 1) training dynamics, 2) reasoning mechanisms, and 3) unintended behaviors. By synthesizing these insights, we aim to bridge the gap between black-box performance and mechanistic transparency. Finally, we discuss under-explored challenges to outline a roadmap for future mechanistic studies, including the need for applied interpretability, improved methodologies, and a unified theoretical framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Daisy, a Danish cultural heritage benchmark using Wikipedia and language models to generate diverse questions from the Danish Culture Canon 2006, validated by humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for Danish culture by leveraging curated cultural artifacts and ensuring coverage of both mainstream and niche topics.

Method: Wikipedia pages of artifacts from the Danish Culture Canon 2006 are queried, and language models generate random questions. Human validation ensures accuracy.

Result: A dataset of 741 close-ended QA pairs spanning 1300 BC to modern times, covering archaeology, literature, music, design, and architecture.

Conclusion: Daisy serves as a robust benchmark for Danish cultural heritage, blending automated generation with human curation for diverse and reliable coverage.

Abstract: We introduce a new benchmark for Danish culture via cultural heritage, Daisy, based on the curated topics from the Danish Culture Canon 2006. For each artifact in the culture canon, we query the corresponding Wikipedia page and have a language model generate random questions. This yields a sampling strategy within each work, with a mix of central of peripheral questions for each work, not only knowledge of mainstream information, but also in-depth cornerstones defining the heritage of Danish Culture, defined by the Canon committee. Each question-answer pair is humanly approved or corrected in the final dataset consisting of 741 close-ended question answer pairs covering topics, from 1300 BC. archaeological findings, 1700 century poems and musicals pieces to contemporary pop music and Danish design and architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hybrid neuro-symbolic system combining neural voting with symbolic tiebreaker achieves 81% accuracy in narrative story similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ambiguous cases in narrative story similarity by enhancing neural predictions with symbolic methods.

Method: Combines neural self-consistency voting (supermajority threshold) with a Multi-Scale Narrative Analysis Ensemble (lexical, semantic, structural, event chain, tension curves) for ties.

Result: Achieves 81% accuracy on the development set.

Conclusion: Selective deferral to symbolic methods improves neural predictions for ambiguous narrative comparisons.

Abstract: We present a hybrid neuro-symbolic system for the SemEval-2026 Task 4 on Narrative Story Similarity. Our approach combines neural self-consistency voting with a novel Multi-Scale Narrative Analysis Ensemble that operates as a symbolic tiebreaker. The neural network component uses a large language model with multiple parallel votes, applying a supermajority threshold for confident decisions and escalating uncertain cases to additional voting rounds. When votes result in a perfect tie, a symbolic ensemble combining five narrative similarity signals (lexical overlap, semantic embeddings, story grammar structure, event chain alignment, and narrative tension curves) provides the final decision. Our cascade architecture achieves 81% accuracy on the development set, demonstrating that selective deferral to symbolic methods can enhance neural predictions on genuinely ambiguous narrative comparisons.

### [82] ["Newspaper Eat" Means "Not Tasty": A Taxonomy and Benchmark for Coded Languages in Real-World Chinese Online Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19932)
*Ruyuan Wan,Changye Li,Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodedLang is a dataset of 7,744 Chinese Google Maps reviews with annotated coded language, introducing a seven-class taxonomy to improve NLP models' handling of coded expressions, which remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models struggle with coded language due to limited datasets and unclear taxonomies.

Method: Created CodedLang with 7,744 Chinese reviews (900 annotated), developed a seven-class taxonomy, and benchmarked models on detection, classification, and rating prediction.

Result: Strong models still fail at coded language tasks, especially with pronunciation-based strategies.

Conclusion: Coded language is a significant, underexplored challenge for NLP systems.

Abstract: Coded language is an important part of human communication. It refers to cases where users intentionally encode meaning so that the surface text differs from the intended meaning and must be decoded to be understood. Current language models handle coded language poorly. Progress has been limited by the lack of real-world datasets and clear taxonomies. This paper introduces CodedLang, a dataset of 7,744 Chinese Google Maps reviews, including 900 reviews with span-level annotations of coded language. We developed a seven-class taxonomy that captures common encoding strategies, including phonetic, orthographic, and cross-lingual substitutions. We benchmarked language models on coded language detection, classification, and review rating prediction. Results show that even strong models can fail to identify or understand coded language. Because many coded expressions rely on pronunciation-based strategies, we further conducted a phonetic analysis of coded and decoded forms. Together, our results highlight coded language as an important and underexplored challenge for real-world NLP systems.

### [83] [Text-to-State Mapping for Non-Resolution Reasoning: The Contradiction-Preservation Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19933)
*Kei Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a text-to-state mapping function for Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR) to preserve semantic ambiguity in language, formalizing the Contradiction-Preservation Principle and validating it empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between natural language and formal state spaces in NRR by maintaining ambiguity rather than forcing premature interpretations.

Method: Develops a mapping function φ to transform linguistic input into superposition states, uses Large Language Models for interpretation generation, and formalizes the Contradiction-Preservation Principle.

Result: Achieves mean Shannon entropy of 1.087 bits for ambiguous inputs, significantly higher than baseline approaches (0.000 bits).

Conclusion: The framework successfully connects raw text to formal state spaces, enabling deferred architectural collapse in language model inference.

Abstract: Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR) provides a formal framework for maintaining semantic ambiguity rather than forcing premature interpretation collapse. While the foundational architecture establishes state spaces and operators for ambiguity-preserving computation, the critical question of how natural language maps to these mathematical structures remains open. This paper introduces the text-to-state mapping function φ that transforms linguistic input into superposition states within the NRR framework. We formalize the Contradiction-Preservation Principle, which requires that genuinely ambiguous expressions maintain non-zero entropy in their state representations, and develop extraction protocols using existing Large Language Models as interpretation generators. Empirical validation across 68 test sentences spanning lexical, structural, and pragmatic ambiguity demonstrates that our mapping achieves mean Shannon entropy H(S) = 1.087 bits for ambiguous inputs while baseline single-interpretation approaches yield H(S) = 0.000. The framework provides the missing algorithmic bridge between raw text and the formal state spaces on which NRR operators act, enabling architectural collapse deferment in language model inference.

*Claire Nicholson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper empirically measures behavioral drift in LLMs under repeated-run conditions, highlighting persistent nondeterminism even at temperature 0.0 and variability by model, prompt type, and deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify baseline behavioral drift in LLMs when identical prompts are reused, addressing variability despite fixed decoding parameters.

Method: Conducted repeated-run experiments with gpt-4o-mini and llama3.1-8b across five prompt categories, using exact repeats, perturbed inputs, and reuse modes at temperatures 0.0 and 0.7. Measured drift via unique output fractions, lexical similarity, and word count statistics.

Result: Nondeterminism persists even at temperature 0.0, with variability patterns differing by model size, deployment, and prompt type.

Conclusion: The study establishes a systematic baseline for evaluating drift mitigation methods, emphasizing the limitations of lexical metrics and the potential of semantic approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for tasks ranging from summarisation to decision support. In practice, identical prompts do not always produce identical outputs, even when temperature and other decoding parameters are fixed. In this work, we conduct repeated-run experiments to empirically quantify baseline behavioural drift, defined as output variability observed when the same prompt is issued multiple times under operator-free conditions. We evaluate two publicly accessible models, gpt-4o-mini and llama3.1-8b, across five prompt categories using exact repeats, perturbed inputs, and reuse modes at temperatures of 0.0 and 0.7. Drift is measured using unique output fractions, lexical similarity, and word count statistics, enabling direct comparison across models, prompting modes, and deployment types. The results show that nondeterminism persists even at temperature 0.0, with distinct variability patterns by model size, deployment, and prompt type. We situate these findings within existing work on concept drift, behavioural drift, and infrastructure-induced nondeterminism, discuss the limitations of lexical metrics, and highlight emerging semantic approaches. By establishing a systematic empirical baseline in the absence of stabilisation techniques, this study provides a reference point for evaluating future drift mitigation and control methods.

### [85] [Mem2ActBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Long-Term Memory Utilization in Task-Oriented Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19935)
*Yiting Shen,Kun Li,Wei Zhou,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mem2ActBench is introduced to evaluate LLM-based agents' ability to proactively use long-term memory for tool-based tasks, addressing gaps in current benchmarks. The dataset synthesizes 2,029 sessions and experiments show existing frameworks struggle with memory-dependent parameter grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks test passive memory retrieval but fail to evaluate active memory application in tool-based tasks, prompting the creation of Mem2ActBench.

Method: An automated pipeline merges heterogeneous sources, resolves conflicts, and synthesizes sessions. Reverse-generation produces tool-use tasks, validated via human evaluation.

Result: Human evaluation confirms 91.3% of tasks are memory-dependent, and experiments reveal current systems inadequately utilize memory for parameter grounding.

Conclusion: Mem2ActBench highlights gaps in memory frameworks and underscores the need for better methods to evaluate and improve memory application in task execution.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed for complex, tool-based tasks where long-term memory is critical to driving actions. Existing benchmarks, however, primarily test a angent's ability to passively retrieve isolated facts in response to explicit questions. They fail to evaluate the more crucial capability of actively applying memory to execute tasks. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{Mem2ActBench}, a benchmark for evaluating whether agents can proactively leverage long-term memory to execute tool-based actions by selecting appropriate tools and grounding their parameters. The benchmark simulates persistent assistant usage, where users mention the same topic across long, interrupted interactions and expect previously established preferences and task states to be implicitly applied. We build the dataset with an automated pipeline that merges heterogeneous sources (ToolACE, BFCL, Oasst1), resolves conflicts via consistency modeling, and synthesizes 2,029 sessions with 12 user--assistant--tool turns on average. From these memory chains, a reverse-generation method produces 400 tool-use tasks, with human evaluation confirming 91.3\% are strongly memory-dependent. Experiments on seven memory frameworks show that current systems remain inadequate at actively utilizing memory for parameter grounding, highlighting the need for more effective approaches to evaluate and improve memory application in task execution.

*Thomas Schuster,Julius Trögele,Nico Döring,Robin Krüger,Matthieu Hoffmann,Holger Friedrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A study evaluates 29 ASR models for German medical transcription, highlighting performance gaps in handling dialects and medical terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for German medical ASR, particularly for dialects, and reduce medical documentation workload.

Method: Curated dataset of simulated doctor-patient conversations; evaluated 29 ASR models (open-weights and commercial APIs) using WER, CER, BLEU metrics and qualitative analysis.

Result: Significant performance differences observed; best models achieve WER below 3%, while others struggle with medical terms and dialects.

Conclusion: Despite some high-performing models, challenges remain in accurately transcribing medical terminology and dialect-influenced speech.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) offers significant potential to reduce the workload of medical personnel, for example, through the automation of documentation tasks. While numerous benchmarks exist for the English language, specific evaluations for the German-speaking medical context are still lacking, particularly regarding the inclusion of dialects. In this article, we present a curated dataset of simulated doctor-patient conversations and evaluate a total of 29 different ASR models. The test field encompasses both open-weights models from the Whisper, Voxtral, and Wav2Vec2 families as well as commercial state-of-the-art APIs (AssemblyAI, Deepgram). For evaluation, we utilize three different metrics (WER, CER, BLEU) and provide an outlook on qualitative semantic analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance differences between the models: while the best systems already achieve very good Word Error Rates (WER) of partly below 3%, the error rates of other models, especially concerning medical terminology or dialect-influenced variations, are considerably higher.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses detecting AI-generated text using large-scale corpora and novel training strategies, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of verifying text authenticity due to advanced AI-generated text necessitates robust detection methods.

Method: Developed detection models using large human-authored and AI-generated corpora, with two novel training paradigms: Per LLM and Per LLM family fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved up to 99.6% token-level accuracy on a 100-million-token benchmark covering 21 LLMs, surpassing existing baselines.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates effective AI-generated text detection using comprehensive datasets and tailored training approaches.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models has enabled the generation of text that closely resembles human writing, creating challenges for authenticity verification in education, publishing, and digital security. Detecting AI-generated text has therefore become a crucial technical and ethical issue. This paper presents a comprehensive study of AI-generated text detection based on large-scale corpora and novel training strategies. We introduce a 1-billion-token corpus of human-authored texts spanning multiple genres and a 1.9-billion-token corpus of AI-generated texts produced by prompting a variety of LLMs across diverse domains. Using these resources, we develop and evaluate numerous detection models and propose two novel training paradigms: Per LLM and Per LLM family fine-tuning. Across a 100-million-token benchmark covering 21 large language models, our best fine-tuned detector achieves up to $99.6\%$ token-level accuracy, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines.

*Pragatheeswaran Vipulanandan,Kamal Premaratne,Dilip Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A quantum-inspired framework for quantifying uncertainty in LLM outputs helps detect hallucinations and prioritize reliable results, outperforming existing methods across multiple models and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent but unreliable outputs (confabulations), requiring a principled method to quantify uncertainty and detect hallucinations for better reliability.

Method: Uses a quantum tensor network pipeline to quantify aleatoric uncertainty in token sequences, enabling semantic equivalence clustering and an entropy maximization strategy to highlight unreliable outputs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in AUROC and AURAC across 116 experiments on TriviaQA, NQ, SVAMP, and SQuAD datasets with multiple LLM architectures.

Conclusion: The framework provides interpretable, robust hallucination detection and practical guidelines for human oversight, even in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to confabulations, fluent yet unreliable outputs that vary arbitrarily even under identical prompts. Leveraging a quantum tensor network based pipeline, we propose a quantum physics inspired uncertainty quantification framework that accounts for aleatoric uncertainty in token sequence probability for semantic equivalence based clustering of LLM generations. This offers a principled and interpretable scheme for hallucination detection. We further introduce an entropy maximization strategy that prioritizes high certainty, semantically coherent outputs and highlights entropy regions where LLM decisions are likely to be unreliable, offering practical guidelines for when human oversight is warranted. We evaluate the robustness of our scheme under different generation lengths and quantization levels, dimensions overlooked in prior studies, demonstrating that our approach remains reliable even in resource constrained deployments. A total of 116 experiments on TriviaQA, NQ, SVAMP, and SQuAD across multiple architectures including Mistral-7B, Mistral-7B-instruct, Falcon-rw-1b, LLaMA-3.2-1b, LLaMA-2-13b-chat, LLaMA-2-7b-chat, LLaMA-2-13b, and LLaMA-2-7b show consistent improvements in AUROC and AURAC over state of the art baselines.

*Nishanth Sridhar Nakshatri,Eylon Caplan,Rajkumar Pujari,Dan Goldwasser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAIGR is a framework analyzing health influencer discourse by identifying takeaways, constructing argumentation graphs, and validating takeaways probabilistically, showing better results than claim-centric methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health influencers shape public beliefs through narratives, but existing verification methods miss pragmatic meaning in their discourse.

Method: TAIGR operates in three stages: identifying takeaways, building argumentation graphs, and probabilistic inference for validation.

Result: TAIGR outperforms claim-centric methods by modeling discourse structure in influencer video transcripts.

Conclusion: Modeling pragmatic and argumentative structures is crucial for accurate validation of influencer discourse.

Abstract: Health influencers play a growing role in shaping public beliefs, yet their content is often conveyed through conversational narratives and rhetorical strategies rather than explicit factual claims. As a result, claim-centric verification methods struggle to capture the pragmatic meaning of influencer discourse. In this paper, we propose TAIGR (Takeaway Argumentation Inference with Grounded References), a structured framework designed to analyze influencer discourse, which operates in three stages: (1) identifying the core influencer recommendation--takeaway; (2) constructing an argumentation graph that captures influencer justification for the takeaway; (3) performing factor graph-based probabilistic inference to validate the takeaway. We evaluate TAIGR on a content validation task over influencer video transcripts on health, showing that accurate validation requires modeling the discourse's pragmatic and argumentative structure rather than treating transcripts as flat collections of claims.

### [90] [Counterfactual Cultural Cues Reduce Medical QA Accuracy in LLMs: Identifier vs Context Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20102)
*Amirhossein Haji Mohammad Rezaei,Zahra Shakeri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A counterfactual benchmark tests medical language models' accuracy when exposed to cultural information, revealing significant accuracy drops, especially when cultural cues combine. Human-validated analysis shows culture-referential reasoning often leads to incorrect diagnoses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure healthcare equity, medical language models must maintain diagnostic accuracy despite non-decisive cultural cues, preventing bias-induced errors.

Method: Expanded 150 MedQA test items into 1650 variants with cultural identifiers, contextual cues, or both for three groups, plus neutral controls. Evaluated multiple models under option-only and brief-explanation prompting. Used a human-validated rubric to analyze explanations.

Result: Cultural cues significantly reduce accuracy (Cochran's Q, p<10^-14), especially when identifiers and context co-occur (3-7 pp drop). Over half of culturally grounded explanations led to incorrect answers.

Conclusion: Culture-referential reasoning in models correlates with diagnostic errors. Released prompts and augmentations to aid evaluation and mitigation of cultural biases.

Abstract: Engineering sustainable and equitable healthcare requires medical language models that do not change clinically correct diagnoses when presented with non-decisive cultural information. We introduce a counterfactual benchmark that expands 150 MedQA test items into 1650 variants by inserting culture-related (i) identifier tokens, (ii) contextual cues, or (iii) their combination for three groups (Indigenous Canadian, Middle-Eastern Muslim, Southeast Asian), plus a length-matched neutral control, where a clinician verified that the gold answer remains invariant in all variants. We evaluate GPT-5.2, Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1, and MedGemma (4B/27B) under option-only and brief-explanation prompting. Across models, cultural cues significantly affect accuracy (Cochran's Q, $p<10^-14$), with the largest degradation when identifier and context co-occur (up to 3-7 percentage points under option-only prompting), while neutral edits produce smaller, non-systematic changes. A human-validated rubric ($κ=0.76$) applied via an LLM-as-judge shows that more than half of culturally grounded explanations end in an incorrect answer, linking culture-referential reasoning to diagnostic failure. We release prompts and augmentations to support evaluation and mitigation of culturally induced diagnostic errors.

*Faezeh Hosseini,Mohammadali Yousefzadeh,Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FFEs (fixed figurative expressions) challenge LLMs due to cultural and non-compositional aspects, leading to figurative hallucination. FFEHallu evaluates this in Persian, highlighting weaknesses in models' figurative competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges LLMs face with culturally grounded, non-compositional FFEs, which are prone to figurative hallucination, especially in underrepresented languages like Persian.

Method: Created FFEHallu, a benchmark with 600 instances across three tasks: FFE generation, detection of fabricated FFEs, and FFE translation (English to Persian). Evaluated six multilingual LLMs.

Result: Models like GPT4.1 perform well in rejecting fabricated FFEs but struggle to distinguish real from high-quality fabrications and often hallucinate during translation. Weaknesses in figurative competence and cultural grounding are evident.

Conclusion: Significant gaps exist in LLMs' handling of figurative language, emphasizing the need for targeted benchmarks to assess and mitigate figurative hallucination.

Abstract: Figurative language, particularly fixed figurative expressions (FFEs) such as idioms and proverbs, poses persistent challenges for large language models (LLMs). Unlike literal phrases, FFEs are culturally grounded, largely non-compositional, and conventionally fixed, making them especially vulnerable to figurative hallucination. We define figurative hallucination as the generation or endorsement of expressions that sound idiomatic and plausible but do not exist as authentic figurative expressions in the target language. We introduce FFEHallu, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating figurative hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on Persian, a linguistically rich yet underrepresented language. FFEHallu consists of 600 carefully curated instances spanning three complementary tasks: (i) FFE generation from meaning, (ii) detection of fabricated FFEs across four controlled construction categories, and (iii) FFE to FFE translation from English to Persian. Evaluating six state of the art multilingual LLMs, we find systematic weaknesses in figurative competence and cultural grounding. While models such as GPT4.1 demonstrate relatively strong performance in rejecting fabricated FFEs and retrieving authentic ones, most models struggle to reliably distinguish real expressions from high quality fabrications and frequently hallucinate during cross lingual translation. These findings reveal substantial gaps in current LLMs handling of figurative language and underscore the need for targeted benchmarks to assess and mitigate figurative hallucination.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores RLVR to reduce hallucinations in LLMs by rewarding abstention and correctness, showing moderate abstention rewards reduce errors without major accuracy loss, especially in larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce unreliable or hallucinated content. This study aims to improve their reliability in factual domains by promoting intellectual humility through explicit rewards for abstention.

Method: The authors fine-tune Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct using RLVR on MedMCQA and Hendrycks Math benchmarks, experimenting with ternary reward structures ($-1$, r_abs, 1) and combining RLVR with supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Moderate abstention rewards (r_abs ≈ -0.25 to 0.3) reduce incorrect responses without significant accuracy degradation. Larger models handle abstention incentives better, but open-ended tasks face exploration limits.

Conclusion: RLVR with verifiable rewards is feasible for hallucination mitigation, with supervised abstention training partially addressing exploration challenges in open-ended tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinated or unverifiable content, undermining their reliability in factual domains. This work investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a training paradigm that explicitly rewards abstention ("I don't know") alongside correctness to promote intellectual humility. We fine-tune and evaluate Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct on the MedMCQA and Hendrycks Math benchmarks using a ternary reward structure ($-1$, r_abs, 1) under varying abstention reward structures. We further study the effect of combining RLVR with supervised fine-tuning strategies that teach abstention prior to reinforcement learning. Our results show that moderate abstention rewards (r_abs $\approx -0.25$ to 0.3) consistently reduce incorrect responses without severe accuracy degradation on multiple-choice tasks, with larger models exhibiting greater robustness to abstention incentives. On open-ended question answering, we observe limitations due to insufficient exploration, which can be partially mitigated through supervised abstention training. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of verifiable reward design as a practical approach for hallucination mitigation in language models. Reproducible code for our abstention training framework is available here https://github.com/Mystic-Slice/rl-abstention.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for the Bengali language has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. However, progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale and diverse annotated datasets. Although several Bengali sentiment and hate speech datasets are publicly available, most are limited in size or confined to a single domain, such as social media comments. Consequently, these resources are often insufficient for training modern deep learning based models, which require large volumes of heterogeneous data to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we introduce BengaliSent140, a large-scale Bengali binary sentiment dataset constructed by consolidating seven existing Bengali text datasets into a unified corpus. To ensure consistency across sources, heterogeneous annotation schemes are systematically harmonized into a binary sentiment formulation with two classes: Not Hate (0) and Hate (1). The resulting dataset comprises 139,792 unique text samples, including 68,548 hate and 71,244 not-hate instances, yielding a relatively balanced class distribution. By integrating data from multiple sources and domains, BengaliSent140 offers broader linguistic and contextual coverage than existing Bengali sentiment datasets and provides a strong foundation for training and benchmarking deep learning models. Baseline experimental results are also reported to demonstrate the practical usability of the dataset. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akifislam/bengalisent140/

*Zilai Wang,Natarajan Balaji Shankar,Kaiyuan Zhang,Zihan Wang,Abeer Alwan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using delta SSL embeddings improves child ASR performance by up to 10% WER reduction compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Child ASR is challenging due to limited data and pretraining domain mismatch. Fine-tuning SSL models on child speech causes shifts in representation space.

Method: Delta SSL embeddings (differences between finetuned and pretrained embeddings) are fused with another SSL model's finetuned features. Evaluated on the MyST children's corpus.

Result: Delta embedding fusion with WavLM reduces WER by 10% for HuBERT and 4.4% for W2V2. Combining WavLM with delta W2V2 achieves a WER of 9.64, setting new SOTA.

Conclusion: Delta embeddings are effective for child ASR, and feature fusion is a promising direction for advancement.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have achieved impressive results across many speech tasks, yet child automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains challenging due to limited data and pretraining domain mismatch. Fine-tuning SSL models on child speech induces shifts in the representation space. We hypothesize that delta SSL embeddings, defined as the differences between embeddings from a finetuned model and those from its pretrained counterpart, encode task-specific information that complements finetuned features from another SSL model. We evaluate multiple fusion strategies on the MyST childrens corpus using different models. Results show that delta embedding fusion with WavLM yields up to a 10 percent relative WER reduction for HuBERT and a 4.4 percent reduction for W2V2, compared to finetuned embedding fusion. Notably, fusing WavLM with delta W2V2 embeddings achieves a WER of 9.64, setting a new state of the art among SSL models on the MyST corpus. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of delta embeddings and highlight feature fusion as a promising direction for advancing child ASR.

*Ziyi Wang,Yuxuan Lu,Yimeng Zhang,Jing Huang,Jiri Gesi,Xianfeng Tang,Chen Luo,Yisi Sang,Hanqing Lu,Manling Li,Dakuo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Trajectory2Task is a pipeline generating verifiable tasks for studying tool-calling agents in realistic scenarios like ambiguous, changing, or infeasible intents, improving LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in training and evaluation data for tool-calling agents facing real-world complexities like ambiguous, changing, or infeasible user requests.

Method: The pipeline generates multi-turn tool-call trajectories, converts them into user tasks with controlled intent adaptations, and uses these for closed-loop evaluation and training.

Result: Benchmarking shows frequent failures in state-of-the-art LLMs, while fine-tuned models improve across all scenarios and generalize better.

Conclusion: Trajectory2Task effectively bridges the gap in realistic tool-use evaluation and enhances LLM tool-calling abilities.

Abstract: Tool-calling agents are increasingly deployed in real-world customer-facing workflows. Yet most studies on tool-calling agents focus on idealized settings with general, fixed, and well-specified tasks. In real-world applications, user requests are often (1) ambiguous, (2) changing over time, or (3) infeasible due to policy constraints, and training and evaluation data that cover these diverse, complex interaction patterns remain under-represented. To bridge the gap, we present Trajectory2Task, a verifiable data generation pipeline for studying tool use at scale under three realistic user scenarios: ambiguous intent, changing intent, and infeasible intents. The pipeline first conducts multi-turn exploration to produce valid tool-call trajectories. It then converts these trajectories into user-facing tasks with controlled intent adaptations. This process yields verifiable task that support closed-loop evaluation and training. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art LLMs on the generated complex user scenario tasks and observe frequent failures. Finally, using successful trajectories obtained from task rollouts, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs and find consistent improvements across all three conditions, along with better generalization to unseen tool-use domains, indicating stronger general tool-calling ability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Me-Agent addresses LLM-based mobile agents' lack of personalization by incorporating user habit learning and hierarchical preference memory, achieving top performance on personalized tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based mobile agents fail to meet personalized needs due to inability to interpret ambiguous instructions, learn from history, or handle personalized instructions.

Method: Me-Agent uses a two-level approach: prompt-level user preference learning with a Personal Reward Model and memory-level Hierarchical Preference Memory for long-term and app-specific storage.

Result: Me-Agent excels in personalization on the User FingerTip benchmark and maintains strong instruction execution performance.

Conclusion: Me-Agent successfully enhances personalization in mobile agents through innovative learning and memory strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based mobile agents have made significant performance advancements. However, these agents often follow explicit user instructions while overlooking personalized needs, leading to significant limitations for real users, particularly without personalized context: (1) inability to interpret ambiguous instructions, (2) lack of learning from user interaction history, and (3) failure to handle personalized instructions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose Me-Agent, a learnable and memorable personalized mobile agent. Specifically, Me-Agent incorporates a two-level user habit learning approach. At the prompt level, we design a user preference learning strategy enhanced with a Personal Reward Model to improve personalization performance. At the memory level, we design a Hierarchical Preference Memory, which stores users' long-term memory and app-specific memory in different level memory. To validate the personalization capabilities of mobile agents, we introduce User FingerTip, a new benchmark featuring numerous ambiguous instructions for daily life. Extensive experiments on User FingerTip and general benchmarks demonstrate that Me-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance in personalization while maintaining competitive instruction execution performance.

*Husein Zolkepli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: X-Codec-2.0 improved by reducing latent rate to 25 Hz and increasing output sampling rate to 24 kHz, enhancing efficiency and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original X-Codec-2.0 configuration limits temporal efficiency and audio fidelity, prompting exploration of modifications.

Method: Introduced additional pooling and increased decoder hop size to reduce latent rate and raise sampling rate.

Result: Achieved 0.29 MOS improvement over baseline and best performance among 25 Hz codecs.

Conclusion: Proposed modifications enhance efficiency and quality without altering core architecture.

Abstract: X-Codec-2.0 has shown strong performance in neural audio compression and multilingual speech modeling, operating at a 50 Hz latent rate and a 16 kHz sampling rate using frozen HuBERT features. While effective, this configuration limits temporal efficiency and audio fidelity. In this work, we explore a simple and effective modification by introducing additional pooling and increasing the decoder hop size. This reduces the latent rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz and simultaneously raises the output sampling rate from 16 kHz to 24 kHz, improving efficiency and perceptual quality without altering the core architecture. Evaluated on the multilingual Common Voice 17 test set, the proposed configuration achieves a 0.29 MOS improvement over the original X-Codec-2.0 baseline based on UTMOSv2, and attains the best reported performance among all codecs operating at 25 Hz.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance natural human-computer interaction by enabling real-time, full-duplex voice dialogue.

Method: Decomposes dialogue into minimal units, processed independently, using auxiliary modules like VAD and TTS.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on HumDial dataset, ranking second in a full-duplex interaction challenge.

Conclusion: The framework offers a train-free, plug-and-play solution for natural voice interaction.

Abstract: Full-duplex voice interaction is crucial for natural human computer interaction. We present a framework that decomposes complex dialogue into minimal conversational units, enabling the system to process each unit independently and predict when to transit to the next. This framework is instantiated as a semi-cascaded full-duplex dialogue system built around a multimodal large language model, supported by auxiliary modules such as voice activity detection (VAD) and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. The resulting system operates in a train-free, plug-and-play manner. Experiments on the HumDial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, which ranks second among all teams on the test set of the Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (Track 2: Full-Duplex Interaction).

*Si Chen,Le Huy Khiem,Annalisa Szymanski,Ronald Metoyer,Ting Hua,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for automated benchmark generation from expert guidelines to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities in practice-based domains, revealing gaps between model and human-like reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' contextualized reasoning in practice-based domains, where knowledge is procedural and not easily captured by factual recall.

Method: The method involves converting expert-authored guidelines into violation-based scenarios and expanding them into auto-graded MCQs and multi-turn dialogues across four cognitive levels (using Bloom's Taxonomy).

Result: Results show LLMs perform better on higher-order reasoning (Analyze) but struggle with lower-level items (Remember), highlighting non-intuitive model behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, deterministic evaluation of LLMs' reasoning in real-world settings, producing psychometrically informed benchmarks.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) evaluates a model's ability to perform contextualized reasoning beyond factual recall. This challenge is especially acute in practice-based domains, where knowledge is procedural and grounded in professional judgment, while most existing LLM benchmarks depend on pre-existing human exam datasets that are often unavailable in such settings. We introduce a framework for automated benchmark generation from expert-authored guidelines informed by Bloom's Taxonomy. It converts expert practices into implicit violation-based scenarios and expands them into auto-graded multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and multi-turn dialogues across four cognitive levels, enabling deterministic, reproducible, and scalable evaluation. Applied to three applied domains: teaching, dietetics, and caregiving, we find differences between model and human-like reasoning: LLMs sometimes perform relatively better on higher-order reasoning (Analyze) but fail more frequently on lower-level items (Remember). We produce large-scale, psychometrically informed benchmarks that surface these non-intuitive model behaviors and enable evaluation of contextualized reasoning in real-world settings.

*Xuanyu Su,Diana Inkpen,Nathalie Japkowicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SoftHateBench, a benchmark for detecting subtle soft hate speech disguised as neutral discourse, revealing gaps in current moderation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moderation systems focus on overt hate speech, missing reasoning-driven hostility that appears neutral but sustains harmful stances.

Method: Integrates Argumentum Model of Topics (AMT) and Relevance Theory (RT) to generate soft-hate variants while preserving hostile standpoints.

Result: Tests show detection systems often fail on soft hate, highlighting significant gaps in moderation effectiveness.

Conclusion: SoftHateBench systematically exposes deficiencies in existing hate speech detection, urging improvements for nuanced moderation.

Abstract: Online hate on social media ranges from overt slurs and threats (\emph{hard hate speech}) to \emph{soft hate speech}: discourse that appears reasonable on the surface but uses framing and value-based arguments to steer audiences toward blaming or excluding a target group. We hypothesize that current moderation systems, largely optimized for surface toxicity cues, are not robust to this reasoning-driven hostility, yet existing benchmarks do not measure this gap systematically. We introduce \textbf{\textsc{SoftHateBench}}, a generative benchmark that produces soft-hate variants while preserving the underlying hostile standpoint. To generate soft hate, we integrate the \emph{Argumentum Model of Topics} (AMT) and \emph{Relevance Theory} (RT) in a unified framework: AMT provides the backbone argument structure for rewriting an explicit hateful standpoint into a seemingly neutral discussion while preserving the stance, and RT guides generation to keep the AMT chain logically coherent. The benchmark spans \textbf{7} sociocultural domains and \textbf{28} target groups, comprising \textbf{4,745} soft-hate instances. Evaluations across encoder-based detectors, general-purpose LLMs, and safety models show a consistent drop from hard to soft tiers: systems that detect explicit hostility often fail when the same stance is conveyed through subtle, reasoning-based language. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer.} Contains offensive examples used solely for research.}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for psycholinguistic analysis in Russian texts by adapting LIWC, considering grammatical and cultural nuances.

Method: Developed a dictionary for Russian using lexicographic resources, semantic dictionaries, and corpora; mapped lemmas to 42 categories; integrated syntactic, morphological, and statistical features; utilized pre-trained LMs.

Result: A comprehensive approach (96 categories) and a web service (RusLICA) for analyzing Russian texts psycholinguistically.

Conclusion: The adapted LIWC method for Russian, with a custom-built dictionary and integrated LM predictions, provides an effective tool for psycholinguistic analysis, enhancing research capabilities in the field.

Abstract: Defining psycholinguistic characteristics in written texts is a task gaining increasing attention from researchers. One of the most widely used tools in the current field is Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) that originally was developed to analyze English texts and translated into multiple languages. Our approach offers the adaptation of LIWC methodology for the Russian language, considering its grammatical and cultural specificities. The suggested approach comprises 96 categories, integrating syntactic, morphological, lexical, general statistical features, and results of predictions obtained using pre-trained language models (LMs) for text analysis. Rather than applying direct translation to existing thesauri, we built the dictionary specifically for the Russian language based on the content from several lexicographic resources, semantic dictionaries and corpora. The paper describes the process of mapping lemmas to 42 psycholinguistic categories and the implementation of the analyzer as part of RusLICA web service.

### [102] [Beyond the Needle's Illusion: Decoupled Evaluation of Evidence Access and Use under Semantic Interference at 326M-Token Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20276)
*Tianwei Lin,Zuyi Zhou,Xinda Zhao,Chenke Wang,Xiaohong Li,Yu Chen,Chuanrui Hu,Jian Pei,Yafeng Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) evaluation for long-context LLM agents, introducing EverMemBench-S (EMB-S) as an adversarial benchmark to measure semantic discrimination and evidence access in large-scale environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations like NIAH inadequately assess long-context LLM agents' ability to handle semantic interference and accurately retrieve evidence from large datasets. EMB-S addresses this gap.

Method: EMB-S uses a 326M-token MemoryBank with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets. It evaluates evidence access and end-to-end QA separately, ensuring fair comparisons for native long-context models.

Result: Systems excelling in benign NIAH perform poorly in EMB-S under semantic interference, revealing semantic discrimination as the key bottleneck for long-context memory.

Conclusion: Semantic discrimination, not just context length, is critical for effective long-context memory. EMB-S provides a robust benchmark for evaluating this capability.

Abstract: Long-context LLM agents must access the right evidence from large environments and use it faithfully. However, the popular Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) evaluation mostly measures benign span localization. The needle is near-unique, and the haystack is largely irrelevant. We introduce EverMemBench-S (EMB-S), an adversarial NIAH-style benchmark built on a 326M-token MemoryBank. While the full MemoryBank spans 326M tokens for retrieval-based (RAG) evaluation, we evaluate native long-context models only at scales that fit within each model's context window (up to 1M tokens in this work) to ensure a fair comparison. EMB-S pairs queries with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets spanning one or more documents, validated via human screening and LLM verification. We also propose a decoupled diagnostic protocol that reports evidence access (document-ID localization) separately from end-to-end QA quality under full-context prompting. This enables consistent diagnosis for both native long-context prompting and retrieval pipelines. Across a reference-corpus ladder from domain-isolated 64K contexts to a globally shared 326M-token environment, we observe a clear reality gap. Systems that saturate benign NIAH degrade sharply in evidence access under semantic interference. These results indicate that semantic discrimination, not context length alone, is the dominant bottleneck for long-context memory at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiLorE-SSL is a lightweight framework combining LoRA and soft MoE for efficient multilingual SSL with minimal forgetting and low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual SSL models struggle with integrating new languages due to computational expense and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: MiLorE-SSL uses LoRA for low-rank adaptation and soft MoE for expert sharing, supplemented by limited replay data.

Result: Achieves strong performance in new languages and retains existing language abilities with only 2.14% trainable parameters.

Conclusion: MiLorE-SSL effectively addresses multilingual SSL challenges with efficient adaptation and minimal forgetting.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has greatly advanced speech representation learning, but multilingual SSL models remain constrained to languages encountered during pretraining. Retraining from scratch to incorporate new languages is computationally expensive, while sequential training without migitation strategies often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose MiLorE-SSL, a lightweight framework that combines LoRA modules with a soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism for efficient continual multilingual training. LoRA provides efficient low-rank adaptation, while soft MoE promotes flexible expert sharing across languages, reducing cross-lingual interference. To further mitigate forgetting, we introduce limited replay data from existing languages, avoiding reliance on large historical corpora. Experiments on ML-SUPERB demonstrate that MiLorE-SSL achieves strong performance in new languages and improves the ability in existing ones with only 2.14% trainable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect fine-grained reasoning steps, causing inefficiency and widening the reasoner-verifier gap. SAPO leverages Error-Related Negativity (ERN) principles for adaptive optimization.

Method: SAPO introduces adaptive process supervision signals, actively reducing the reasoner-verifier gap without relying on inefficient Monte Carlo estimations.

Result: SAPO outperforms existing self-evolution methods in mathematics and coding tasks. New benchmarks for process reward models are introduced.

Conclusion: SAPO effectively bridges the reasoner-verifier gap and enhances SLM performance, with promising applications in math and code tasks.

Abstract: Existing self-evolution methods overlook the influence of fine-grained reasoning steps, which leads to the reasoner-verifier gap. The computational inefficiency of Monte Carlo (MC) process supervision further exacerbates the difficulty in mitigating the gap. Motivated by the Error-Related Negativity (ERN), which the reasoner can localize error following incorrect decisions, guiding rapid adjustments, we propose a Self-Adaptive Process Optimization (SAPO) method for self-improvement in Small Language Models (SLMs). SAPO adaptively and efficiently introduces process supervision signals by actively minimizing the reasoner-verifier gap rather than relying on inefficient MC estimations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms most existing self-evolution methods on two challenging task types: mathematics and code. Additionally, to further investigate SAPO's impact on verifier performance, this work introduces two new benchmarks for process reward models in both mathematical and coding tasks.

TL;DR: KV caches are repurposed as lightweight representations for downstream tasks, eliminating the need for recomputing hidden states. They perform competitively in Chain-of-Embedding and enable adaptive reasoning with significant token savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage KV caches beyond autoregressive decoding, as they encode reusable contextual information for downstream tasks without additional cost.

Method: Treat KV caches as lightweight representations for applications like Chain-of-Embedding and Fast/Slow Thinking Switching, testing on models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct.

Result: KV-derived representations achieve competitive or superior performance in Chain-of-Embedding and reduce token generation by up to 5.7x with minimal accuracy loss in adaptive reasoning.

Conclusion: KV caches are a free and effective substrate for sampling and reasoning, offering new directions for representation reuse in LLM inference.

Abstract: KV caches, typically used only to speed up autoregressive decoding, encode contextual information that can be reused for downstream tasks at no extra cost. We propose treating the KV cache as a lightweight representation, eliminating the need to recompute or store full hidden states. Despite being weaker than dedicated embeddings, KV-derived representations are shown to be sufficient for two key applications: \textbf{(i) Chain-of-Embedding}, where they achieve competitive or superior performance on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct; and \textbf{(ii) Fast/Slow Thinking Switching}, where they enable adaptive reasoning on Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distil-Qwen-14B, reducing token generation by up to $5.7\times$ with minimal accuracy loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-as-a-Judge paradigms show promise but face gaps between benchmark performance and RL effectiveness due to pairwise evaluation dominance and inadequate optimization.

Method: Proposes CE-RM-4B, trained with a two-stage rollout method and unified query-based criteria, using 5.7K high-quality data.

Result: CE-RM-4B outperforms benchmarks, especially in Best-of-N scenarios, and improves downstream RL practice.

Conclusion: CE-RM-4B effectively bridges the performance gap, offering a more reliable solution for NLP evaluation and RL applications.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation is crucial yet challenging for open-ended natural language generation, especially when rule-based metrics are infeasible. Compared with traditional methods, the recent LLM-as-a-Judge paradigms enable better and more flexible evaluation, and show promise as generative reward models for reinforcement learning. However, prior work has revealed a notable gap between their seemingly impressive benchmark performance and actual effectiveness in RL practice. We attribute this issue to some limitations in existing studies, including the dominance of pairwise evaluation and inadequate optimization of evaluation criteria. Therefore, we propose CE-RM-4B, a pointwise generative reward model trained with a dedicated two-stage rollout method, and adopting unified query-based criteria. Using only about 5.7K high-quality data curated from the open-source preference dataset, our CE-RM-4B achieves superior performance on diverse reward model benchmarks, especially in Best-of-N scenarios, and delivers more effective improvements in downstream RL practice.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PsychePass, a unified framework to evaluate the therapeutic competence of large language models (LLMs) in mental healthcare, addressing instability in current evaluation methods through trajectory-anchored tournaments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLMs in mental healthcare suffer from instability due to process drift and standard drift, making it difficult to reliably assess their therapeutic competence.

Method: PsychePass uses client-controlled simulation to anchor interaction trajectories and a Swiss-system tournament with dynamic pairwise battles to produce robust Elo ratings. It also converts tournament trajectories into reward signals for reinforcement learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show PsychePass is effective and aligns well with human expert judgments.

Conclusion: PsychePass provides a reliable and consistent framework for evaluating and improving the therapeutic competence of LLMs in mental healthcare.

Abstract: While large language models show promise in mental healthcare, evaluating their therapeutic competence remains challenging due to the unstructured and longitudinal nature of counseling. We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.

TL;DR: MobileBench-OL is a new online benchmark for GUI agents, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by evaluating task execution, reasoning, and noise robustness in real-world mobile environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current online benchmarks for GUI agents lack comprehensive evaluation of reasoning, exploration, and noise robustness, creating a gap between testing and real-world environments.

Method: Proposes MobileBench-OL with 1080 tasks from 80 apps, 5 subsets for multidimensional evaluation, and an auto-eval framework with a reset mechanism for reliable testing.

Result: Evaluation of 12 leading GUI agents reveals significant improvement needed to meet real-world requirements, confirmed by human evaluation.

Conclusion: MobileBench-OL effectively measures GUI agent performance in real environments, with plans to release data and code upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent advances in mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents highlight the growing need for comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. While new online benchmarks offer more realistic testing than offline ones, they tend to focus on the agents' task instruction-following ability while neglecting their reasoning and exploration ability. Moreover, these benchmarks do not consider the random noise in real-world mobile environments. This leads to a gap between benchmarks and real-world environments. To addressing these limitations, we propose MobileBench-OL, an online benchmark with 1080 tasks from 80 Chinese apps. It measures task execution, complex reasoning, and noise robustness of agents by including 5 subsets, which set multiple evaluation dimensions. We also provide an auto-eval framework with a reset mechanism, enabling stable and repeatable real-world benchmarking. Evaluating 12 leading GUI agents on MobileBench-OL shows significant room for improvement to meet real-world requirements. Human evaluation further confirms that MobileBench-OL can reliably measure the performance of leading GUI agents in real environments. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.

*Qihao Wang,Yue Hu,Mingzhe Lu,Jiayue Wu,Yanbing Liu,Yuanmin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework based on Cognitive Load Theory to evaluate LLMs' tool-use capabilities by breaking down task complexity into Intrinsic and Extraneous Load. A benchmark, ToolLoad-Bench, is created to map model performance under varying cognitive loads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLMs focus on final accuracy but fail to identify cognitive bottlenecks, limiting understanding of true capabilities.

Method: The framework uses Cognitive Load Theory, quantifying task complexity into Intrinsic Load (structural complexity) and Extraneous Load (task presentation difficulty). ToolLoad-Bench is designed for controlled experiments.

Result: Performance declines sharply as cognitive load increases, allowing precise mapping of model boundaries. The framework's predictions align closely with empirical results.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled way to understand LLMs' limits and a foundation for building more efficient systems.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to use external tools unlocks powerful real-world interactions, making rigorous evaluation essential. However, current benchmarks primarily report final accuracy, revealing what models can do but obscuring the cognitive bottlenecks that define their true capability boundaries. To move from simple performance scoring to a diagnostic tool, we introduce a framework grounded in Cognitive Load Theory. Our framework deconstructs task complexity into two quantifiable components: Intrinsic Load, the inherent structural complexity of the solution path, formalized with a novel Tool Interaction Graph; and Extraneous Load, the difficulty arising from ambiguous task presentation. To enable controlled experiments, we construct ToolLoad-Bench, the first benchmark with parametrically adjustable cognitive load. Our evaluation reveals distinct performance cliffs as cognitive load increases, allowing us to precisely map each model's capability boundary. We validate that our framework's predictions are highly calibrated with empirical results, establishing a principled methodology for understanding an agent's limits and a practical foundation for building more efficient systems.

*Biswesh Mohapatra,Marcely Zanon Boito,Ioan Calapodescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpeechMapper is a cost-efficient method for integrating speech models with LLMs, reducing overfitting and computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for bridging speech models to LLMs are computationally intensive and prone to overfitting, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: SpeechMapper pretrains without the LLM on affordable hardware, then briefly tunes it with the LLM via 1K-step instruction tuning.

Result: SpeechMapper performs comparably or better than existing methods in task-agnostic and task-specific scenarios, using less data and compute.

Conclusion: SpeechMapper provides a scalable and efficient alternative for speech-LLM integration, avoiding large-scale instruction tuning.

Abstract: Current speech LLMs bridge speech foundation models to LLMs using projection layers, training all of these components on speech instruction data. This strategy is computationally intensive and susceptible to task and prompt overfitting. We present SpeechMapper, a cost-efficient speech-to-LLM-embedding training approach that mitigates overfitting, enabling more robust and generalizable models. Our model is first pretrained without the LLM on inexpensive hardware, and then efficiently attached to the target LLM via a brief 1K-step instruction tuning (IT) stage. Through experiments on speech translation and spoken question answering, we demonstrate the versatility of SpeechMapper's pretrained block, presenting results for both task-agnostic IT, an ASR-based adaptation strategy that does not train in the target task, and task-specific IT. In task-agnostic settings, Speechmapper rivals the best instruction-following speech LLM from IWSLT25, despite never being trained on these tasks, while in task-specific settings, it outperforms this model across many datasets, despite requiring less data and compute. Overall, SpeechMapper offers a practical and scalable approach for efficient, generalizable speech-LLM integration without large-scale IT.

*Anna Ristilä,Otto Tarkka,Veronika Laippala,Kimmo Elo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines emotion expression in topic-specific parliamentary speeches in Finland (2000-2020), revealing increasing positivity and topic-emotion links.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in research on emotions linked to specific topics in parliamentary discourse, which is often treated homogeneously.

Method: An emotion analysis model is applied to parliamentary speeches from Eduskunta (Finnish Parliament) from synchronic and diachronic perspectives.

Result: Findings show increasing positivity in parliamentary speech and insights into topic-specific emotion expression.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of emotional patterns in parliamentary debates, highlighting topic-emotion relationships.

Abstract: Existing research often treats parliamentary discourse as a homogeneous whole, overlooking topic-specific patterns. Parliamentary speeches address a wide range of topics, some of which evoke stronger emotions than others. While everyone has intuitive assumptions about what the most emotive topics in a parliament may be, there has been little research into the emotions typically linked to different topics. This paper strives to fill this gap by examining emotion expression among the topics of parliamentary speeches delivered in Eduskunta, the Finnish Parliament, between 2000 and 2020. An emotion analysis model is used to investigate emotion expression in topics, from both synchronic and diachronic perspectives. The results strengthen evidence of increasing positivity in parliamentary speech and provide further insights into topic-specific emotion expression within parliamentary debate.

TL;DR: PEARL is a framework enhancing LLM planning for tool use, using offline exploration and online reinforcement learning to improve success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with planning and execution in multi-turn tool invocation, facing issues like weak planning and errors.

Method: PEARL uses a two-stage approach: offline tool exploration and online reinforcement learning (GRPO) with a specialized reward function.

Result: PEARL achieves a 56.5% success rate on ToolHop, outperforming existing methods while keeping error rates low.

Conclusion: PEARL advances LLM-based agent capabilities for robust and reliable tool use.

Abstract: Large Language Models show great potential with external tools, but face significant challenges in complex, multi-turn tool invocation. They often exhibit weak planning, tool hallucination, erroneous parameter generation, and struggle with robust interaction. To tackle these issues, we present PEARL, a novel framework to enhance LLM planning and execution for sophisticated tool use. PEARL adopts a two-stage approach: an offline phase where the agent explores tools to learn valid usage patterns and failure conditions, and an online reinforcement learning phase. In the online phase, a dedicated Planner is trained via group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a carefully designed reward function that provides distinct signals for planning quality. Experiments on the ToolHop and T-Eval benchmarks show PEARL significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art success rate of \textbf{56.5\%} on ToolHop while maintaining a low invocation error rate. Our work marks a key advance in addressing the complex planning challenges of tool use, contributing to the development of more robust and reliable LLM-based agents.

### [113] [MuVaC: AVariational Causal Framework for Multimodal Sarcasm Understanding in Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20451)
*Diandian Guo,Fangfang Yuan,Cong Cao,Xixun Lin,Chuan Zhou,Hao Peng,Yanan Cao,Yanbing Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MuVaC is a variational causal framework addressing multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) and explanation (MuSE) jointly, leveraging structural causal models and alignment-fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research often treats MSD and MuSE separately or overlooks their causal dependency, limiting holistic sarcasm understanding.

Method: Proposes MuVaC, modeling MSD and MuSE via structural causal models, aligning then fusing multimodal features, and ensuring consistency.

Result: MuVaC outperforms benchmarks on public datasets, enhancing sarcasm detection and explanation accuracy.

Conclusion: MuVaC provides a robust, causal approach for joint MSD and MuSE, advancing multimodal sarcasm analysis.

Abstract: The prevalence of sarcasm in multimodal dialogues on the social platforms presents a crucial yet challenging task for understanding the true intent behind online content. Comprehensive sarcasm analysis requires two key aspects: Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD) and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE). Intuitively, the act of detection is the result of the reasoning process that explains the sarcasm. Current research predominantly focuses on addressing either MSD or MuSE as a single task. Even though some recent work has attempted to integrate these tasks, their inherent causal dependency is often overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose MuVaC, a variational causal inference framework that mimics human cognitive mechanisms for understanding sarcasm, enabling robust multimodal feature learning to jointly optimize MSD and MuSE. Specifically, we first model MSD and MuSE from the perspective of structural causal models, establishing variational causal pathways to define the objectives for joint optimization. Next, we design an alignment-then-fusion approach to integrate multimodal features, providing robust fusion representations for sarcasm detection and explanation generation. Finally, we enhance the reasoning trustworthiness by ensuring consistency between detection results and explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MuVaC in public datasets, offering a new perspective for understanding multimodal sarcasm.

TL;DR: BMAM is a memory architecture for language-model-based agents, inspired by cognitive systems, to address 'soul erosion' by decomposing memory into specialized subsystems. It achieves 78.45% accuracy in long-horizon evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenges of preserving temporally grounded information and maintaining behavioral consistency in language-model-based agents over extended interactions, termed 'soul erosion'.

Method: BMAM decomposes memory into episodic, semantic, salience-aware, and control-oriented components, inspired by cognitive systems. It organizes episodic memories along timelines and fuses multiple signals for retrieval.

Result: BMAM achieves 78.45% accuracy on the LoCoMo benchmark, with episodic memory playing a critical role in temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: BMAM's functional decomposition of memory improves long-horizon reasoning and consistency in language-model-based agents.

Abstract: Language-model-based agents operating over extended interaction horizons face persistent challenges in preserving temporally grounded information and maintaining behavioral consistency across sessions, a failure mode we term soul erosion. We present BMAM (Brain-inspired Multi-Agent Memory), a general-purpose memory architecture that models agent memory as a set of functionally specialized subsystems rather than a single unstructured store. Inspired by cognitive memory systems, BMAM decomposes memory into episodic, semantic, salience-aware, and control-oriented components that operate at complementary time scales. To support long-horizon reasoning, BMAM organizes episodic memories along explicit timelines and retrieves evidence by fusing multiple complementary signals. Experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark show that BMAM achieves 78.45 percent accuracy under the standard long-horizon evaluation setting, and ablation analyses confirm that the hippocampus-inspired episodic memory subsystem plays a critical role in temporal reasoning.

*Evanfiya Logacheva,Arto Hellas,Tsvetomila Mihaylova,Juha Sorva,Ava Heinonen,Juho Leinonen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel RST-based method for improving AI-generated diagram code by aligning outputs with user expectations, reducing factual hallucination, and enhancing faithfulness to context, though quality varies due to LLM stochasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about the quality of generative AI outputs in computing education by improving diagram generation through alignment with user expectations.

Method: Uses Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) with in-context examples for diagram code generation, evaluated by educators on logical organization, connectivity, layout aesthetic, and hallucination.

Result: Preliminary results show reduced hallucination and improved faithfulness, but quality varies due to LLM stochasticity; higher-complexity contexts increase hallucination.

Conclusion: The RST-based method improves diagram generation, but LLM limitations like stochasticity and error detection remain challenges.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has found a widespread use in computing education; at the same time, quality of generated materials raises concerns among educators and students. This study addresses this issue by introducing a novel method for diagram code generation with in-context examples based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), which aims to improve diagram generation by aligning models' output with user expectations. Our approach is evaluated by computer science educators, who assessed 150 diagrams generated with large language models (LLMs) for logical organization, connectivity, layout aesthetic, and AI hallucination. The assessment dataset is additionally investigated for its utility in automated diagram evaluation. The preliminary results suggest that our method decreases the rate of factual hallucination and improves diagram faithfulness to provided context; however, due to LLMs' stochasticity, the quality of the generated diagrams varies. Additionally, we present an in-depth analysis and discussion on the connection between AI hallucination and the quality of generated diagrams, which reveals that text contexts of higher complexity lead to higher rates of hallucination and LLMs often fail to detect mistakes in their output.

### [116] [Beyond Divergent Creativity: A Human-Based Evaluation of Creativity in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20546)
*Kumiko Nakajima,Jan Zuiderveld,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the Divergent Association Task (DAT) for evaluating LLMs' creativity, introduces the Conditional Divergent Association Task (CDAT) combining novelty and appropriateness, and finds smaller models often outperform larger ones in creativity under CDAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous evaluations of LLMs' creativity lack grounding in human creativity theory, focusing solely on novelty (via DAT) and ignoring appropriateness. This makes results hard to interpret.

Method: The authors introduce CDAT, which assesses novelty conditional on appropriateness, grounded in human creativity theory. They evaluate various LLMs on CDAT and compare performance to baselines.

Result: Under CDAT, smaller LLM families often show higher creativity, while advanced families prioritize appropriateness over novelty. DAT scores for LLMs were lower than non-creative baselines, questioning its validity.

Conclusion: Training and alignment may trade novelty for appropriateness in LLMs. CDAT, combining both criteria, offers a better tool for evaluating creativity. The dataset and code are released.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in verbal creative tasks. However, previous assessments of the creative capabilities of LLMs remain weakly grounded in human creativity theory and are thus hard to interpret. The widely used Divergent Association Task (DAT) focuses on novelty, ignoring appropriateness, a core component of creativity. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs on DAT and show that their scores on the task are lower than those of two baselines that do not possess any creative abilities, undermining its validity for model evaluation. Grounded in human creativity theory, which defines creativity as the combination of novelty and appropriateness, we introduce Conditional Divergent Association Task (CDAT). CDAT evaluates novelty conditional on contextual appropriateness, separating noise from creativity better than DAT, while remaining simple and objective. Under CDAT, smaller model families often show the most creativity, whereas advanced families favor appropriateness at lower novelty. We hypothesize that training and alignment likely shift models along this frontier, making outputs more appropriate but less creative. We release the dataset and code.

### [117] [Single-Nodal Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in NLP Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20582)
*Shalom Rosner,Ronit D. Gross,Ella Koresh,Ido Kanter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores spontaneous symmetry breaking in NLP models during pre-training and fine-tuning, showing it occurs at individual attention heads and scales down to single nodes. A crossover in learning ability emerges as nodes increase, balancing random-guess decline with cooperative enhancement. Demonstrated using BERT-6 on Wikipedia and FewRel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking in NLP models, analogous to phase transitions in statistical mechanics, and understand its implications for learning dynamics and network task performance.

Method: Analyzes BERT-6 architecture during pre-training (Wikipedia dataset) and fine-tuning (FewRel classification task), focusing on individual attention heads and nodal behavior under deterministic dynamics.

Result: Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs at attention heads and nodes, with a crossover in learning ability as nodes increase. Nodal cooperation enhances learning beyond individual capabilities, and functions are upper-bounded via convex hull analysis.

Conclusion: The study reveals symmetry breaking in NLP models, linking nodal behavior to global task performance. It contrasts with spin-glass systems by explicitly connecting nodal function to network goals, validated through BERT-6 experiments.

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in statistical mechanics primarily occurs during phase transitions at the thermodynamic limit where the Hamiltonian preserves inversion symmetry, yet the low-temperature free energy exhibits reduced symmetry. Herein, we demonstrate the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in natural language processing (NLP) models during both pre-training and fine-tuning, even under deterministic dynamics and within a finite training architecture. This phenomenon occurs at the level of individual attention heads and is scaled-down to its small subset of nodes and also valid at a single-nodal level, where nodes acquire the capacity to learn a limited set of tokens after pre-training or labels after fine-tuning for a specific classification task. As the number of nodes increases, a crossover in learning ability occurs, governed by the tradeoff between a decrease following random-guess among increased possible outputs, and enhancement following nodal cooperation, which exceeds the sum of individual nodal capabilities. In contrast to spin-glass systems, where a microscopic state of frozen spins cannot be directly linked to the free-energy minimization goal, each nodal function in this framework contributes explicitly to the global network task and can be upper-bounded using convex hull analysis. Results are demonstrated using BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel classification task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how language contact affects intermediate representations in monolingual Persian language models, revealing selective contact effects on morphological but not syntactic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how historical language contact influences the internal representations of monolingual language models, using Persian as a case study.

Method: Probing Persian-trained model representations exposed to languages with varying Persian contact, quantifying linguistic information distribution for morphosyntactic features.

Result: Universal syntactic information remains unaffected by contact, while morphological features like Case and Gender reflect language-specific influences.

Conclusion: Contact effects in monolingual models are structurally constrained, impacting morphology more than syntax.

Abstract: We investigate structural traces of language contact in the intermediate representations of a monolingual language model. Focusing on Persian (Farsi) as a historically contact-rich language, we probe the representations of a Persian-trained model when exposed to languages with varying degrees and types of contact with Persian. Our methodology quantifies the amount of linguistic information encoded in intermediate representations and assesses how this information is distributed across model components for different morphosyntactic features. The results show that universal syntactic information is largely insensitive to historical contact, whereas morphological features such as Case and Gender are strongly shaped by language-specific structure, suggesting that contact effects in monolingual language models are selective and structurally constrained.

TL;DR: AgentIF-OneDay benchmarks AI agents' ability to handle diverse daily tasks via natural language, evaluating workflow execution, latent instruction inference, and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limited user perception of AI capabilities in daily scenarios by diversifying task evaluations beyond difficulty.

Method: Proposes AgentIF-OneDay benchmark with 104 tasks across three categories, using rubrics and LLM-human aligned evaluation.

Result: Achieves 80.1% agreement rate between LLM and human judgments; API-based and ChatGPT RL agents perform best.

Conclusion: Leading LLMs exhibit agentic capabilities, enabling advanced AI applications for diverse daily tasks.

Abstract: The capacity of AI agents to effectively handle tasks of increasing duration and complexity continues to grow, demonstrating exceptional performance in coding, deep research, and complex problem-solving evaluations. However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P2S introduces fine-grained process rewards for LLM reasoning tasks, outperforming outcome-focused methods like RLPR by addressing reward sparsity with Path Faithfulness Reward (PFR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods for LLM reasoning tasks focus on outcome-based rewards (e.g., RLPR), lacking step-by-step supervision. P2S aims to fill this gap by providing dense process rewards without human intervention.

Method: P2S synthesizes a high-quality reference reasoning chain (gold-CoT) and calculates Path Faithfulness Reward (PFR) for each reasoning step, derived from conditional probabilities of generating the suffix given the prefix. It integrates PFR with outcome-based rewards.

Result: Experiments on reading comprehension and medical QA benchmarks show P2S significantly outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: P2S effectively addresses reward sparsity in general-domain reasoning tasks by combining process and outcome rewards, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning in structured domains like mathematics and programming, its application to general-domain reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of verifiable reward signals. To this end, methods like Reinforcement Learning with Reference Probability Reward (RLPR) have emerged, leveraging the probability of generating the final answer as a reward signal. However, these outcome-focused approaches neglect crucial step-by-step supervision of the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we introduce Probabilistic Process Supervision (P2S), a novel self-supervision framework that provides fine-grained process rewards without requiring a separate reward model or human-annotated reasoning steps. During reinforcement learning, P2S synthesizes and filters a high-quality reference reasoning chain (gold-CoT). The core of our method is to calculate a Path Faithfulness Reward (PFR) for each reasoning step, which is derived from the conditional probability of generating the gold-CoT's suffix, given the model's current reasoning prefix. Crucially, this PFR can be flexibly integrated with any outcome-based reward, directly tackling the reward sparsity problem by providing dense guidance. Extensive experiments on reading comprehension and medical Question Answering benchmarks show that P2S significantly outperforms strong baselines.

Motivation: To assess LLMs' accuracy in structured data analytics and reliability in extracting info from clinical text with RAG support.

Method: Used a synthetic QA framework on MIMIC III data, combining exact-match metrics, semantic similarity, and human judgment.

Result: LLMs showed potential for precise querying and accurate info extraction in clinical workflows.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively support structured and unstructured EHR data tasks in clinical settings.

Abstract: This study applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to two foundational Electronic Health Record (EHR) data science tasks: structured data querying (using programmatic languages, Python/Pandas) and information extraction from unstructured clinical text via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We test the ability of LLMs to interact accurately with large structured datasets for analytics and the reliability of LLMs in extracting semantically correct information from free text health records when supported by RAG. To this end, we presented a flexible evaluation framework that automatically generates synthetic question and answer pairs tailored to the characteristics of each dataset or task. Experiments were conducted on a curated subset of MIMIC III, (four structured tables and one clinical note type), using a mix of locally hosted and API-based LLMs. Evaluation combined exact-match metrics, semantic similarity, and human judgment. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to support precise querying and accurate information extraction in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: A novel method trains a multimodal planning agent to dynamically decompose the mRAG pipeline, improving efficiency and maintaining performance in VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in mRAG pipelines for VQA tasks by reducing redundant computations while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Train a multimodal planning agent to intelligently determine the necessity of each mRAG step.

Result: Reduces search time by over 60% and decreases costly tool calls while outperforming baselines across six datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances efficiency and effectiveness in VQA tasks.

Abstract: Visual Question-Answering (VQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires integrating visual and textual information to generate accurate responses. While multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has shown promise in enhancing VQA systems by providing more evidence on both image and text sides, the default procedure that addresses VQA queries, especially the knowledge-intensive ones, often relies on multi-stage pipelines of mRAG with inherent dependencies. To mitigate the inefficiency limitations while maintaining VQA task performance, this paper proposes a method that trains a multimodal planning agent, dynamically decomposing the mRAG pipeline to solve the VQA task. Our method optimizes the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness by training the agent to intelligently determine the necessity of each mRAG step. In our experiments, the agent can help reduce redundant computations, cutting search time by over 60\% compared to existing methods and decreasing costly tool calls. Meanwhile, experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, including a Deep Research agent and a carefully designed prompt-based method, on average over six various datasets. Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reverse engineering threatens software security, and traditional VMP is costly and vulnerable. The goal is to leverage LLMs for robust software protection.

Method: The framework builds paired datasets, uses hierarchical dependency modeling, and optimizes contrastive objectives. It includes a protection effectiveness task and a two-stage training pipeline.

Result: ShieldedCode achieves 26.95% Pass@1 on L0 VM code generation (vs. GPT-4o's 22.58%) and improves Recall@1 by 10% over jTrans.

Conclusion: The framework advances learning-based software defense, showing significant robustness improvements across protection levels.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, yet their potential for software protection remains largely untapped. Reverse engineering continues to threaten software security, while traditional virtual machine protection (VMP) relies on rigid, rule-based transformations that are costly to design and vulnerable to automated analysis. In this work, we present the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our approach builds large-scale paired datasets of source code and normalized VM implementations, and introduces hierarchical dependency modeling at intra-, preceding-, and inter-instruction levels. We jointly optimize language modeling with functionality-aware and protection-aware contrastive objectives to capture both semantic equivalence and protection strength. To further assess resilience, we propose a protection effectiveness optimization task that quantifies and ranks different VM variants derived from the same source. Coupled with a two-stage continual pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, our method enables models to generate, compare, and reason over protected code. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves robustness across diverse protection levels, opening a new research direction for learning-based software defense. In this work, we present ShieldedCode, the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our method achieves 26.95% Pass@1 on L0 VM code generation compared to 22.58% for GPT-4o., and improves binary similarity detection Recall@1 by 10% over state of art methods like jTrans.

Motivation: Traditional batch clustering like HDBSCAN struggles with scalability and real-time adaptation in continuous social media data streams. This work aims to bridge the gap between batch processing and streaming data needs.

Method: The study introduces a three-stage pipeline (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) and evaluates online clustering algorithms using sliding-window simulations on historical datasets from Ukraine.

Result: The research provides insights into algorithmic trade-offs for online clustering, balancing traditional metrics (Silhouette Coefficient) with narrative-specific measures (distinctness, variance).

Conclusion: This work addresses scalability challenges in social media monitoring, offering implications for computational social science and crisis informatics by enabling real-time narrative tracking.

Abstract: Automated narrative intelligence systems for social media monitoring face significant scalability challenges when processing continuous data streams using traditional batch clustering algorithms. We investigate the replacement of HDBSCAN (offline clustering) with online (streaming/incremental) clustering methods in a production narrative report generation pipeline. The proposed system employs a three-stage architecture (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) that processes thousands of multilingual social media documents daily. While HDBSCAN excels at discovering hierarchical density-based clusters and handling noise, its batch-only nature necessitates complete retraining for each time window, resulting in memory constraints, computational inefficiency, and inability to adapt to evolving narratives in real-time. This work evaluates a bunch of online clustering algorithms across dimensions of cluster quality preservation, computational efficiency, memory footprint, and integration compatibility with existing workflows. We propose evaluation criteria that balance traditional clustering metrics (Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index) with narrative metrics (narrative distinctness, contingency and variance). Our methodology includes sliding-window simulations on historical datasets from Ukraine information space, enabling comparative analysis of algorithmic trade-offs in realistic operational contexts. This research addresses a critical gap between batch-oriented topic modeling frameworks and the streaming nature of social media monitoring, with implications for computational social science, crisis informatics, and narrative surveillance systems.

Method: AgentLongBench uses simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles to test agents in knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform well in static retrieval but struggle with dynamic information synthesis, with degradation linked to token volume per query.

Conclusion: Dynamic information synthesis remains a challenge for LLMs, highlighting the need for improved handling of high-density information in agent workflows.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.

*Mae Sosto,Delfina Sol Martinez Pandiani,Laura Hollink*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how LLMs reproduce societal biases, focusing on heterocisnormativity, and measures biases in text generations across gender and sexuality categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs reflect societal norms, particularly heterocisnormativity, and how these norms manifest as biases in their outputs.

Method: Examines biases in LLM responses across queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and unmarked categories, measuring sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity in sentence completions.

Result: Masked Language Models (MLMs) show the least favorable sentiment and higher toxicity for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate biases, but closed-access ARLMs produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects.

Conclusion: LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, with bias severity depending on model characteristics, indicating that harms may be redistributed but not eliminated.

Abstract: This paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) reproduce societal norms, particularly heterocisnormativity, and how these norms translate into measurable biases in their text generations. We investigate whether explicit information about a subject's gender or sexuality influences LLM responses across three subject categories: queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and the normalized "unmarked" category. Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes Reddit posts to understand how people evaluate AI for emotional support, finding engagement is driven by outcomes, trust, and response quality, with positive sentiment linked to goal alignment and companionship use posing risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how people evaluate and relate to AI systems like LLMs for emotional support and mental health in everyday, non-clinical settings.

Method: Analyzed 5,126 Reddit posts from mental health communities using a hybrid LLM-human pipeline grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory.

Result: Engagement is influenced by outcomes, trust, and response quality, not just emotional bonds. Positive sentiment correlates with goal alignment, while companionship use risks dependence and symptom escalation.

Conclusion: Theory-grounded constructs can be applied to large-scale discourse analysis, emphasizing the need to study user interpretations of AI in sensitive contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for emotional support and mental health-related interactions outside clinical settings, yet little is known about how people evaluate and relate to these systems in everyday use. We analyze 5,126 Reddit posts from 47 mental health communities describing experiential or exploratory use of AI for emotional support or therapy. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory, we develop a theory-informed annotation framework and apply a hybrid LLM-human pipeline to analyze evaluative language, adoption-related attitudes, and relational alignment at scale. Our results show that engagement is shaped primarily by narrated outcomes, trust, and response quality, rather than emotional bond alone. Positive sentiment is most strongly associated with task and goal alignment, while companionship-oriented use more often involves misaligned alliances and reported risks such as dependence and symptom escalation. Overall, this work demonstrates how theory-grounded constructs can be operationalized in large-scale discourse analysis and highlights the importance of studying how users interpret language technologies in sensitive, real-world contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona prompting improves hate speech classification but reduces rationale quality and fails to align with real-world demographics or mitigate biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLM-generated rationales vary with different demographic personas and assess the impact on model bias and human alignment.

Method: Study uses datasets with word-level rationales to measure agreement with human annotations across demographic groups and evaluates three LLMs.

Result: PP improves hate speech classification but degrades rationale quality, fails to align personas with real-world groups, and doesn't reduce biases.

Conclusion: PP poses a trade-off: better classification but poorer rationales and persistent biases, cautioning its use in sensitive tasks.

Abstract: For socially sensitive tasks like hate speech detection, the quality of explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for factors like user trust and model alignment. While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while PP can improve classification in socially-sensitive tasks, it often comes at the cost of rationale quality and fails to mitigate underlying biases, urging caution in its application.

### [130] [Teaching LLMs to Ask: Self-Querying Category-Theoretic Planning for Under-Specified Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20014)
*Shuhui Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SQ-BCP improves planning under partial observability by explicitly tracking preconditions and using self-queries or bridging hypotheses, reducing violations significantly while maintaining plan quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods hallucinate missing facts or violate constraints under partial observability, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: SQ-BCP uses bidirectional search, precondition tracking (	exttt{Sat/Viol/Unk}), self-queries, bridging hypotheses, and a pullback-based verifier for goal compatibility.

Result: SQ-BCP reduces violation rates to 14.9% and 5.8% on WikiHow and RecipeNLG tasks, outperforming baselines (26.0% and 15.7%).

Conclusion: SQ-BCP effectively handles partial observability, ensuring goal-compatible plans with competitive quality.

Abstract: Inference-time planning with large language models frequently breaks under partial observability: when task-critical preconditions are not specified at query time, models tend to hallucinate missing facts or produce plans that violate hard constraints. We introduce \textbf{Self-Querying Bidirectional Categorical Planning (SQ-BCP)}, which explicitly represents precondition status (\texttt{Sat}/\texttt{Viol}/\texttt{Unk}) and resolves unknowns via (i) targeted self-queries to an oracle/user or (ii) \emph{bridging} hypotheses that establish the missing condition through an additional action. SQ-BCP performs bidirectional search and invokes a pullback-based verifier as a categorical certificate of goal compatibility, while using distance-based scores only for ranking and pruning. We prove that when the verifier succeeds and hard constraints pass deterministic checks, accepted plans are compatible with goal requirements; under bounded branching and finite resolution depth, SQ-BCP finds an accepting plan when one exists. Across WikiHow and RecipeNLG tasks with withheld preconditions, SQ-BCP reduces resource-violation rates to \textbf{14.9\%} and \textbf{5.8\%} (vs.\ \textbf{26.0\%} and \textbf{15.7\%} for the best baseline), while maintaining competitive reference quality.

*Shuhui Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP) introduces graded action applicability and quality composition via t-norms, improving success rates in natural-language planning tasks compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing planners treat applicability as binary, losing meaningful distinctions and quality degradation tracking in multi-step plans.

Method: FCP annotates actions with degrees [0,1], composes quality via Lukasiewicz t-norm, and uses pullback verification for executability. Grounding employs LLM with k-sample median aggregation.

Result: FCP improves success and reduces hard-constraint violations on RecipeNLG-Subs compared to baselines and remains competitive with PDDL3 planners.

Conclusion: FCP effectively handles graded applicability in natural-language planning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Natural-language planning often involves vague predicates (e.g., suitable substitute, stable enough) whose satisfaction is inherently graded. Existing category-theoretic planners provide compositional structure and pullback-based hard-constraint verification, but treat applicability as crisp, forcing thresholding that collapses meaningful distinctions and cannot track quality degradation across multi-step plans. We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG. FCP improves success and reduces hard-constraint violations on RecipeNLG-Subs compared to LLM-only and ReAct-style baselines, while remaining competitive with classical PDDL3 planners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges E-commerce sellers face in discovering tools and utilizing data effectively, IA aims to automate insights and reduce decision-making effort.

Method: The system uses a plan-and-execute paradigm with a hierarchical multi-agent structure (manager and worker agents) and combines OOD detection, BERT-based routing, and dynamic domain knowledge injection.

Result: IA achieved 90% accuracy in human evaluation with P90 latency below 15s for Amazon sellers in the US.

Conclusion: IA effectively empowers E-commerce sellers by automating insights, proving its potential as a force multiplier in decision-making.

Abstract: Today, E-commerce sellers face several key challenges, including difficulties in discovering and effectively utilizing available programs and tools, and struggling to understand and utilize rich data from various tools. We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To allow users to explore how phrasing changes might affect outcomes in LLM-driven control scenarios.

Method: Models interactions as a structural causal model (SCM), uses probabilistic abduction for generating counterfactual outcomes, and includes a calibration phase for reliability guarantees.

Result: Demonstrated significant advantages over naive re-execution baselines in wireless network control.

Conclusion: The CCG framework effectively provides reliable counterfactual outcomes with high probability.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents can translate high-level user intents into plans and actions in an environment. Yet after observing an outcome, users may wonder: What if I had phrased my intent differently? We introduce a framework that enables such counterfactual reasoning in agentic LLM-driven control scenarios, while providing formal reliability guarantees. Our approach models the closed-loop interaction between a user, an LLM-based agent, and an environment as a structural causal model (SCM), and leverages test-time scaling to generate multiple candidate counterfactual outcomes via probabilistic abduction. Through an offline calibration phase, the proposed conformal counterfactual generation (CCG) yields sets of counterfactual outcomes that are guaranteed to contain the true counterfactual outcome with high probability. We showcase the performance of CCG on a wireless network control use case, demonstrating significant advantages compared to naive re-execution baselines.

*Zixuan Xiao,Chunguang Hu,Jun Ma*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework to address limitations of traditional remote sensing methods in urban park development monitoring, leveraging LLM's semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional remote sensing methods lack high-level, intelligent analysis and flexibility for complex multi-modal data in urban park monitoring, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: A multi-modal LLM agent framework is introduced, featuring data alignment mechanisms and a domain-specific toolkit to mitigate LLM hallucinations.

Result: The framework outperforms vanilla GPT-4o and other agents in robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, meeting diverse urban park monitoring needs.

Conclusion: The proposed solution provides reliable and scalable capabilities for urban park development monitoring, addressing current method shortcomings.

Abstract: As an important part of urbanization, the development monitoring of newly constructed parks is of great significance for evaluating the effect of urban planning and optimizing resource allocation. However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Compared to vanilla GPT-4o and other agents, our approach enables robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, offering reliable and scalable solutions tailored to the diverse and evolving demands of urban park development monitoring.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agentic framework called $	extit{method}$ is introduced to improve medical reasoning verification by iteratively querying external medical corpora, combining tool-augmented verification and reinforcement learning, achieving significant accuracy improvements and reduced sampling budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of existing reward models in medical reasoning verification, such as lack of explicit justification and single-pass retrieval, to ensure factual accuracy in clinical settings.

Method: Trains medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora, combining tool-augmented verification with iterative reinforcement learning and an adaptive curriculum mechanism.

Result: Achieves substantial gains: 23.5% improvement in MedQA and 32.0% in MedXpertQA accuracy, with an $	extbf{8×}$ reduction in sampling budget.

Conclusion: Grounded verification in dynamically retrieved evidence provides a principled path toward more reliable medical reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved strong performance on medical reasoning benchmarks, yet their deployment in clinical settings demands rigorous verification to ensure factual accuracy. While reward models offer a scalable approach for reasoning trace verification, existing methods face two limitations: they produce only scalar reward values without explicit justification, and they rely on single-pass retrieval that precludes adaptive knowledge access as verification unfolds. We introduce $\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular. Crucially, $\method$ demonstrates an $\mathbf{8\times}$ reduction in sampling budget requirement compared to prior reward model baselines. These findings establish that grounding verification in dynamically retrieved evidence offers a principled path toward more reliable medical reasoning systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEER, a framework to bridge the Cognitive Gap in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) by using Endogenous Reprompting, improving generation quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMMs often lack the ability to effectively guide their own generation processes, identified as a Cognitive Gap. The goal is to enhance this self-generation capability.

Method: Proposes Endogenous Reprompting and the SEER framework, which uses a two-stage loop: RLVR for latent evaluation activation and RLMT for optimizing generative reasoning. Requires only 300 samples from a compact task.

Result: SEER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality without losing general multimodal capabilities.

Conclusion: The SEER framework successfully bridges the Cognitive Gap in UMMs, demonstrating improved self-guided generation and reasoning.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) exhibit strong understanding, yet this capability often fails to effectively guide generation. We identify this as a Cognitive Gap: the model lacks the understanding of how to enhance its own generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose Endogenous Reprompting, a mechanism that transforms the model's understanding from a passive encoding process into an explicit generative reasoning step by generating self-aligned descriptors during generation. To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy. Experiments show that SEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality, without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities.

Motivation: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models for ECG lack multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise ECG measurement understanding, necessitating ECG-Agent.

Method: ECG-Agent is developed as a tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue, supported by the ECG-MTD dataset. Different agent sizes (on-device to larger) are tested.

Result: ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in accuracy, with on-device agents matching larger ones in evaluations of accuracy, tool-calling, and hallucinations.

Conclusion: ECG-Agent and ECG-MTD address key limitations, showing practical viability for real-world ECG applications through improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have rapidly expanded to electrocardiograms, focusing on classification, report generation, and single-turn QA tasks. However, these models fall short in real-world scenarios, lacking multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise understanding of ECG measurements such as the PQRST intervals. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue. To facilitate its development and evaluation, we also present ECG-Multi-Turn-Dialogue (ECG-MTD) dataset, a collection of realistic user-assistant multi-turn dialogues for diverse ECG lead configurations. We develop ECG-Agents in various sizes, from on-device capable to larger agents. Experimental results show that ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in response accuracy. Furthermore, on-device agents achieve comparable performance to larger agents in various evaluations that assess response accuracy, tool-calling ability, and hallucinations, demonstrating their viability for real-world applications.

TL;DR: AMA framework enhances LLM memory systems by using multi-agent collaboration for adaptive, granular memory management, improving consistency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM memory systems face issues like rigid retrieval granularity and logical inconsistencies, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: AMA uses coordinated agents (Constructor, Retriever, Judge, Refresher) for hierarchical memory management and adaptive retrieval.

Result: AMA outperforms baselines, reduces token use by 80%, and maintains retrieval precision and memory consistency.

Conclusion: AMA offers a scalable solution for robust, efficient memory systems in LLMs, addressing key challenges in current approaches.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has necessitated robust memory systems to support cohesive long-term interaction and complex reasoning. Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.

TL;DR: PoT improves LLMs' complex reasoning by dynamically updating policies via execution feedback, outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing LLMs' instability in long-horizon reasoning by internalizing feedback for real-time policy evolution.

Method: Policy of Thoughts (PoT) uses exploration and GRPO to refine reasoning via transient LoRA adapters.

Result: A 4B PoT model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, surpassing GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Conclusion: PoT demonstrates effective real-time policy refinement for enhanced reasoning in smaller LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex, long-horizon reasoning due to instability caused by their frozen policy assumption. Current test-time scaling methods treat execution feedback merely as an external signal for filtering or rewriting trajectories, without internalizing it to improve the underlying reasoning strategy. Inspired by Popper's epistemology of "conjectures and refutations," we argue that intelligence requires real-time evolution of the model's policy through learning from failed attempts. We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.

TL;DR: OmegaUse is a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on mobile and desktop platforms, using high-quality synthetic data and a decoupled training paradigm to achieve SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revolutionize human-computer interaction and improve productivity by enabling foundation models to execute real-world GUI tasks autonomously.

Method: Combines a data-construction pipeline (autonomous exploration and taxonomy-guided synthesis) with a two-stage training strategy (SFT followed by GRPO) on a MoE backbone.

Result: Achieves SOTA scores (96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2, 79.1% on AndroidControl) and strong performance on OS-Nav benchmarks (74.24% on ChiM-Nav, 55.9% on Ubu-Nav).

Conclusion: OmegaUse demonstrates competitive cross-terminal capabilities, advancing the potential of GUI agents for real-world applications.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.

### [141] [CtrlCoT: Dual-Granularity Chain-of-Thought Compression for Controllable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20467)
*Zhenxuan Fan,Jie Cao,Yang Dai,Zheqi Lv,Wenqiao Zhang,Zhongle Xie,Peng LU,Beng Chin Ooi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CtrlCoT is a dual-granularity framework for compressing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, combining semantic abstraction and token-level pruning to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT compression methods either shorten traces conservatively or prune tokens aggressively, leading to inefficiency or degraded accuracy. CtrlCoT addresses these limitations.

Method: CtrlCoT integrates Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction, Logic-Preserving Distillation, and Distribution-Alignment Generation to harmonize semantic abstraction and token-level pruning.

Result: On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT achieves 7.6 percentage points higher accuracy while using 30.7% fewer tokens compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CtrlCoT demonstrates more efficient and reliable reasoning compared to existing CoT compression methods.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves LLM reasoning but incurs high latency and memory cost due to verbose traces, motivating CoT compression with preserved correctness. Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/fanzhenxuan/Ctrl-CoT.

### [142] [Normative Equivalence in human-AI Cooperation: Behaviour, Not Identity, Drives Cooperation in Mixed-Agent Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20487)
*Nico Mutzner,Taha Yasseri,Heiko Rauhut*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents in human groups didn't change cooperative norms; cooperation levels remained similar regardless of AI or human labels, driven by group behavior rather than identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI agents influence cooperative norms in small groups, beyond dyadic interactions.

Method: Online experiment with a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG), involving groups of three humans and one bot (framed as human or AI). The bot followed one of three strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding.

Result: Cooperation levels were similar across human and AI labels, driven by group dynamics and behavioral inertia. No difference in norm persistence or perceptions was found.

Conclusion: Cooperative norms extend similarly to AI agents, suggesting normative equivalence between human-AI and all-human groups.

Abstract: The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into human group settings raises essential questions about how these novel participants influence cooperative social norms. While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.

*Oguzhan Gungordu,Siheng Xiong,Faramarz Fekri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PathWise is a novel multi-agent framework using LLMs for automated heuristic design, improving efficiency and scalability by leveraging stateful planning and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based frameworks for heuristic design suffer from myopic generation, redundancy, and lack of reasoning about heuristic derivation.

Method: PathWise employs a multi-agent system with a policy agent, world model agent, and critic agents, operating over an entailment graph for stateful memory and planning.

Result: Experiments show PathWise converges faster, produces better heuristics, generalizes across LLMs, and scales effectively.

Conclusion: PathWise advances automated heuristic design by integrating reasoning and planning, outperforming traditional trial-and-error methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated heuristic design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but existing frameworks' reliance on fixed evolutionary rules and static prompt templates often leads to myopic heuristic generation, redundant evaluations, and limited reasoning about how new heuristics should be derived. We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.

*Yaacov Pariente,Vadim Indelman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores risk-sensitive planning in partially observable environments using ICVaR, extends three online planning algorithms to optimize ICVaR, and shows improved tail risk performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address risk-sensitive decision-making under partial observability by leveraging ICVaR, a dynamic risk measure, and extending existing planning algorithms.

Method: Develops a policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR, then adapts Sparse Sampling, PFT-DPW, and POMCPOW algorithms to optimize ICVaR instead of expected return.

Result: Experiments show ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to risk-neutral methods.

Conclusion: ICVaR-based planning effectively mitigates tail risk in partially observable environments while maintaining finite-time guarantees.

Abstract: We study risk-sensitive planning under partial observability using the dynamic risk measure Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR). A policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR is developed with finite-time performance guarantees that do not depend on the cardinality of the action space. Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $α$, where $α= 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $α< 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.

*Gray Cox*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for testing AI alignment via multi-model dialogue, leveraging Peace Studies concepts. Experiments show AI can meaningfully engage with these ideas and produce emergent insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reframe AI alignment as a relationship problem through dialogical reasoning, moving beyond control paradigms, and empirically test this approach.

Method: Deployed Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o in structured dialogues with assigned roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) across six conditions, analyzing 72 dialogue turns.

Result: AI models engaged substantively with Peace Studies concepts, surfaced unique concerns (Claude: verification; Gemini: bias/scalability; GPT-4o: implementation), and generated novel insights like 'VCW as transitional framework.'

Conclusion: The framework enables stress-testing alignment proposals, showing AI's dialogical reasoning potential. Future work includes hybrid human-AI protocols and deeper dialogue studies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodological framework for empirically testing AI alignment strategies through structured multi-model dialogue. Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.
  Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.
  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of "VCW as transitional framework." Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.
  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.

*Yanqi Dai,Yuxiang Ji,Xiao Zhang,Yong Wang,Xiangxiang Chu,Zhiwu Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MathForge improves mathematical reasoning in large models by addressing algorithmic imbalances and systematic data augmentation challenges, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack focus on harder questions, limiting the refinement of mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes MathForge with DGPO (algorithm) for difficulty-aware policy updates and MQR (data strategy) for multi-aspect question reformulation.

Result: MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The synergistic approach of DGPO and MQR effectively enhances mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks. The code and augmented data are all available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MathForge.

TL;DR: LLM-based agents can develop efficient and covert task-oriented communication protocols in collaborative tasks, raising transparency concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can create task-oriented communication protocols that differ from natural language, focusing on efficiency and covertness.

Method: Used a referential-game framework with vision-language model agents to evaluate language variants in a controlled setting.

Result: VLMs developed efficient and covert communication protocols, with spontaneous coordination between similar models.

Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential and risks of task-oriented communication, suggesting referential games as a future testbed.

Abstract: We investigate whether \emph{LLM-based agents} can develop task-oriented communication protocols that differ from standard natural language in collaborative reasoning tasks. Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.

TL;DR: A computational approach for Metric ASP integrates quantitative temporal constraints without scalability loss, using difference constraints to handle time externally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of maintaining scalability in Metric ASP when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints like durations and deadlines.

Method: Extends ASP with difference constraints (simplified linear constraints) to manage time-related aspects externally, decoupling time granularity.

Result: The approach remains scalable regardless of time precision, avoiding grounding bottlenecks.

Conclusion: Metric ASP with external difference constraints offers a scalable solution for quantitative temporal constraints.

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constraints, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.

TL;DR: IBR-GCS integrates game theory, trajectory planning, and combinatorial reasoning for multi-vehicle autonomous driving, ensuring safety and strategic consistency through iterative best-response updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of strategic interaction and hybrid maneuver planning in multi-vehicle autonomous driving under shared safety constraints.

Method: IBR-GCS uses an Iterative Best Response approach within the Graphs of Convex Sets framework, combining combinatorial maneuver reasoning, trajectory planning, and game-theoretic interaction.

Result: Simulations show that IBR-GCS produces safe trajectories and strategically consistent behaviors in multi-lane, multi-vehicle scenarios.

Conclusion: IBR-GCS effectively balances safety and strategic interaction in autonomous driving, converging to approximate generalized Nash equilibria.

Abstract: Multi-vehicle autonomous driving couples strategic interaction with hybrid (discrete-continuous) maneuver planning under shared safety constraints. We introduce IBR-GCS, an Iterative Best Response (IBR) planning approach based on the Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) framework that models highway driving as a generalized noncooperative game. IBR-GCS integrates combinatorial maneuver reasoning, trajectory planning, and game-theoretic interaction within a unified framework. The key novelty is a vehicle-specific, strategy-dependent GCS construction. Specifically, at each best-response update, each vehicle builds its own graph conditioned on the current strategies of the other vehicles, with vertices representing lane-specific, time-varying, convex, collision-free regions and edges encoding dynamically feasible transitions. This yields a shortest-path problem in GCS for each best-response step, which admits an efficient convex relaxation that can be solved using convex optimization tools without exhaustive discrete tree search. We then apply an iterative best-response scheme in which vehicles update their trajectories sequentially and provide conditions under which the resulting inexact updates converge to an approximate generalized Nash equilibrium. Simulation results across multi-lane, multi-vehicle scenarios demonstrate that IBR-GCS produces safe trajectories and strategically consistent interactive behaviors.

TL;DR: A framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems using Shapley values to attribute and quantify risk contributions across time, agents, and behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and interpreting extreme events in multi-agent systems is crucial for system safety, given their black-box nature.

Method: Adapts Shapley values to attribute extreme events to actions, aggregates scores across time, agents, and behaviors, and designs metrics to characterize events.

Result: Effective in diverse scenarios (economic, financial, social), providing insights into extreme phenomena emergence.

Conclusion: The framework successfully explains extreme events and quantifies risk contributions, aiding safety and understanding in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large language model-powered multi-agent systems have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex human-like systems. The interactions within these systems often lead to extreme events whose origins remain obscured by the black box of emergence. Interpreting these events is critical for system safety. This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event. We then aggregate the attribution scores along the dimensions of time, agent, and behavior to quantify the risk contribution of each dimension. Finally, we design a set of metrics based on these contribution scores to characterize the features of extreme events. Experiments across diverse multi-agent system scenarios (economic, financial, and social) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide general insights into the emergence of extreme phenomena.

TL;DR: Gap-K% is a new method for detecting pretraining data in LLMs, addressing privacy and copyright concerns by leveraging log probability gaps and local token correlations, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of pretraining corpora in LLMs raises privacy and copyright issues, highlighting the need for effective pretraining data detection methods.

Method: Gap-K% analyzes optimization dynamics in LLMs, using log probability gaps between top-1 predictions and target tokens, combined with a sliding window strategy for local correlations.

Result: Experiments on WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks show Gap-K% achieves state-of-the-art performance across different model sizes and input lengths.

Conclusion: Gap-K% effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance in pretraining data detection.

Abstract: The opacity of massive pretraining corpora in Large Language Models (LLMs) raises significant privacy and copyright concerns, making pretraining data detection a critical challenge. Existing state-of-the-art methods typically rely on token likelihoods, yet they often overlook the divergence from the model's top-1 prediction and local correlation between adjacent tokens. In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations. Extensive experiments on the WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks demonstrate that Gap-K% achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming prior baselines across various model sizes and input lengths.

*Adnan Ahmad,Chiara Boldrini,Lorenzo Valerio,Andrea Passarella,Marco Conti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust aggregation method for Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) to address data and model heterogeneity, improving convergence and reducing communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFL faces challenges like data and model initialization heterogeneities, leading to slower convergence due to varying local model parameters.

Method: Introduces a novel aggregation approach using consensus weights derived from second-order information of local models to scale neighbourhood updates.

Result: Experiments show improved generalizability of local models and reduced communication costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses heterogeneity in DFL, enhancing model performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is a serverless collaborative machine learning paradigm where devices collaborate directly with neighbouring devices to exchange model information for learning a generalized model. However, variations in individual experiences and different levels of device interactions lead to data and model initialization heterogeneities across devices. Such heterogeneities leave variations in local model parameters across devices that leads to slower convergence. This paper tackles the data and model heterogeneity by explicitly addressing the parameter level varying evidential credence across local models. A novel aggregation approach is introduced that captures these parameter variations in local models and performs robust aggregation of neighbourhood local updates. Specifically, consensus weights are generated via approximation of second-order information of local models on their local datasets. These weights are utilized to scale neighbourhood updates before aggregating them into global neighbourhood representation. In extensive experiments with computer vision tasks, the proposed approach shows strong generalizability of local models at reduced communication costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Oculomix, a hierarchical sampling strategy for mixed sample augmentations, outperforms traditional methods like CutMix and MixUp by up to 3% in AUROC for predicting cardiovascular events using retinal imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-level augmentation techniques (e.g., CutMix, MixUp) disrupt patient-specific attributes like comorbidities and clinical factors. Oculomix aims to preserve these attributes by leveraging hierarchical relationships in retinal imaging data.

Method: Oculomix uses two clinical priors: (1) same patient/time point images share attributes, and (2) same patient/different time points exhibit a soft temporal trend. It constrains mixing to patient and exam levels for better attribute preservation.

Result: On a diverse population (Alzeye), Oculomix outperformed CutMix and MixUp by up to 3% in AUROC for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over five years.

Conclusion: Oculomix demonstrates the value of hierarchical sampling for preserving patient-specific characteristics in oculomics, improving predictive performance for systemic diseases.

Abstract: Oculomics - the concept of predicting systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and dementia, through retinal imaging - has advanced rapidly due to the data efficiency of transformer-based foundation models like RETFound. Image-level mixed sample data augmentations, such as CutMix and MixUp, are frequently used for training transformers, yet these techniques perturb patient-specific attributes, such as medical comorbidity and clinical factors, since they only account for images and labels. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical sampling strategy, Oculomix, for mixed sample augmentations. Our method is based on two clinical priors. First (exam level), images acquired from the same patient at the same time point share the same attributes. Second (patient level), images acquired from the same patient at different time points have a soft temporal trend, as morbidity generally increases over time. Guided by these priors, our method constrains the mixing space to the patient and exam levels to better preserve patient-specific characteristics and leverages their hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is validated using ViT models on a five-year prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a large ethnically diverse population (Alzeye). We show that Oculomix consistently outperforms image-level CutMix and MixUp by up to 3% in AUROC, demonstrating the necessity and value of the proposed method in oculomics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to designing data-rate-aware CNN architectures for FPGAs, ensuring high hardware utilization by interleaving and sharing hardware units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data flow implementations for CNNs suffer from underutilization due to data reduction in pooling and convolutional layers. This work aims to optimize hardware usage.

Method: Analyzes CNN data flow, interleaves low data rate signals, shares hardware units, and uses parallelization to maintain throughput.

Result: The approach achieves close to 100% hardware utilization, saving arithmetic logic and enabling complex CNN implementations like MobileNet on a single FPGA.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses hardware underutilization in CNNs, offering high throughput and efficiency for FPGA implementations.

Abstract: Among hardware accelerators for deep-learning inference, data flow implementations offer low latency and high throughput capabilities. In these architectures, each neuron is mapped to a dedicated hardware unit, making them well-suited for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Previous unrolled implementations mostly focus on fully connected networks because of their simplicity, although it is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require fewer computations for the same accuracy. When observing the data flow in CNNs, pooling layers and convolutional layers with a stride larger than one, the number of data at their output is reduced with respect to their input. This data reduction strongly affects the data rate in a fully parallel implementation, making hardware units heavily underutilized unless it is handled properly. This work addresses this issue by analyzing the data flow of CNNs and presents a novel approach to designing data-rate-aware, continuous-flow CNN architectures. The proposed approach ensures a high hardware utilization close to 100% by interleaving low data rate signals and sharing hardware units, as well as using the right parallelization to achieve the throughput of a fully parallel implementation. The results show that a significant amount of the arithmetic logic can be saved, which allows implementing complex CNNs like MobileNet on a single FPGA with high throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the emergence of multi-step reasoning in deep language models by analyzing their hidden-state dynamics through geometric and statistical-physics frameworks.

Method: Analyzes the covariance spectrum of activations across layers, tracks deviations from random-matrix behavior, and formalizes the forward pass as a coarse-graining map. Theoretical conditions connect logical separability to spectral decay.

Result: Observes a sharp reduction in effective dimensionality and a phase transition near a critical depth. Identifies Transient Class Objects (TCOs) in representation space and validates theoretical predictions with layerwise probes.

Conclusion: The study reveals a low-entropy regime with emergent structures (TCOs) and provides theoretical insights into the dynamics of multi-step reasoning in Transformers.

Abstract: We study the emergence of multi-step reasoning in deep Transformer language models through a geometric and statistical-physics lens. Treating the hidden-state trajectory as a flow on an implicit Riemannian manifold, we analyze the layerwise covariance spectrum of activations, where $C^{(\ell)}=\mathbb{E}[h^{(\ell)}h^{(\ell)\top}]$, and track deviations from a random-matrix bulk. Across model scales (1.5B--30B), we observe a sharp reduction in effective dimensionality consistent with a phase transition: an order parameter based on sparsity/localization, $Ω(h)=1-\|h\|_1/(\sqrt{d}\|h\|_2)$, exhibits a discontinuity near a critical normalized depth $γ_c\approx 0.42$ in sufficiently large models. We formalize the forward pass as a discrete coarse-graining map and relate the appearance of stable "concept basins" to fixed points of this renormalization-like dynamics. The resulting low-entropy regime is characterized by a spectral tail collapse and by the formation of transient, reusable object-like structures in representation space, which we call Transient Class Objects (TCOs). We provide theoretical conditions connecting logical separability to spectral decay and validate the predicted signatures with layerwise probes on multiple open-weight model families.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how populations of learners can develop coordinated, diverse behaviors without explicit communication or diversity incentives.

Method: Introduces the NichePopulation algorithm, combining competitive exclusion with niche affinity tracking, tested in cryptocurrency trading, commodity prices, weather forecasting, solar irradiance, urban traffic, and air quality.

Result: Achieves a mean Specialization Index of 0.75, diverse populations outperform homogeneous baselines by +26.5%, and outperforms MARL baselines by 4.3x while being 4x faster.

Conclusion: Competition alone suffices for emergent specialization, enabling diverse populations to outperform homogeneous ones significantly.

Abstract: How can populations of learners develop coordinated, diverse behaviors without explicit communication or diversity incentives? We demonstrate that competition alone is sufficient to induce emergent specialization -- learners spontaneously partition into specialists for different environmental regimes through competitive dynamics, consistent with ecological niche theory. We introduce the NichePopulation algorithm, a simple mechanism combining competitive exclusion with niche affinity tracking. Validated across six real-world domains (cryptocurrency trading, commodity prices, weather forecasting, solar irradiance, urban traffic, and air quality), our approach achieves a mean Specialization Index of 0.75 with effect sizes of Cohen's d > 20. Key findings: (1) At lambda=0 (no niche bonus), learners still achieve SI > 0.30, proving specialization is genuinely emergent; (2) Diverse populations outperform homogeneous baselines by +26.5% through method-level division of labor; (3) Our approach outperforms MARL baselines (QMIX, MAPPO, IQL) by 4.3x while being 4x faster.

*Valery Manokhin,Daniel Grønhaug*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates model-agnostic post-hoc calibration methods for binary classification, benchmarking 21 classifiers and five calibrators, with Venn-Abers and Beta calibration showing the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve probabilistic predictions in supervised binary classification with distribution-free validity guarantees, focusing on conformal and Venn-based approaches.

Method: Benchmarked 21 classifiers on TabArena-v0.1 tasks using cross-validation, applied five calibrators, and evaluated using scoring rules and diagnostic measures.

Result: Venn-Abers predictors and Beta calibration performed best, while Platt scaling and isotonic regression sometimes degraded performance. Calibration effects varied widely.

Conclusion: No single calibration method dominates; Venn-Abers and Beta calibration showed the most consistent improvements, but effects depend on dataset and model architecture.

Abstract: We study model-agnostic post-hoc calibration methods intended to improve probabilistic predictions in supervised binary classification on real i.i.d. tabular data, with particular emphasis on conformal and Venn-based approaches that provide distribution-free validity guarantees under exchangeability. We benchmark 21 widely used classifiers, including linear models, SVMs, tree ensembles (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM), and modern tabular neural and foundation models, on binary tasks from the TabArena-v0.1 suite using randomized, stratified five-fold cross-validation with a held-out test fold. Five calibrators; Isotonic regression, Platt scaling, Beta calibration, Venn-Abers predictors, and Pearsonify are trained on a separate calibration split and applied to test predictions. Calibration is evaluated using proper scoring rules (log-loss and Brier score) and diagnostic measures (Spiegelhalter's Z, ECE, and ECI), alongside discrimination (AUC-ROC) and standard classification metrics. Across tasks and architectures, Venn-Abers predictors achieve the largest average reductions in log-loss, followed closely by Beta calibration, while Platt scaling exhibits weaker and less consistent effects. Beta calibration improves log-loss most frequently across tasks, whereas Venn-Abers displays fewer instances of extreme degradation and slightly more instances of extreme improvement. Importantly, we find that commonly used calibration procedures, most notably Platt scaling and isotonic regression, can systematically degrade proper scoring performance for strong modern tabular models. Overall classification performance is often preserved, but calibration effects vary substantially across datasets and architectures, and no method dominates uniformly. In expectation, all methods except Pearsonify slightly increase accuracy, but the effect is marginal, with the largest expected gain about 0.008%.

*Jiayu Xu,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Noise-Compensated Sharpness-aware Minimization (NCSAM), a method leveraging loss landscape flatness to improve generalization and robustness against noisy labels, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of Learning from Noisy Labels (LNL) in deep learning, aiming to enhance model performance despite corrupted annotations commonly found in real-world datasets.

Method: The proposed NCSAM uses perturbations from Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to mitigate label noise effects, supported by theoretical analysis linking loss landscape flatness to label noise robustness.

Result: Experiments show NCSAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets, achieving robustness and generalization similar to noise-free scenarios.

Conclusion: NCSAM effectively combines theoretical insights with practical perturbations to address noisy labels, offering superior performance in diverse tasks.

Abstract: Learning from Noisy Labels (LNL) presents a fundamental challenge in deep learning, as real-world datasets often contain erroneous or corrupted annotations, \textit{e.g.}, data crawled from Web. Current research focuses on sophisticated label correction mechanisms. In contrast, this paper adopts a novel perspective by establishing a theoretical analysis the relationship between flatness of the loss landscape and the presence of label noise. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that carefully simulated label noise synergistically enhances both the generalization performance and robustness of label noises. Consequently, we propose Noise-Compensated Sharpness-aware Minimization (NCSAM) to leverage the perturbation of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to remedy the damage of label noises. Our analysis reveals that the testing accuracy exhibits a similar behavior that has been observed on the noise-clear dataset. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art approaches on diverse tasks.

TL;DR: A probabilistic sensing paradigm inspired by the autonomic nervous system achieves energy-efficient, lossless data acquisition with minimal error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending sensor intelligence to data-acquisition decisions can improve energy efficiency but risks information loss if done deterministically.

Method: Uses a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) driven by an analog feature extraction circuit, enabling real-time autonomous sampling decisions.

Result: Demonstrates lossless probabilistic data acquisition with 0.41% normalized mean squared error and 93% savings in operation time and samples.

Conclusion: The probabilistic approach enables transformative energy-efficient sensing without compromising data integrity.

Abstract: Extending the intelligence of sensors to the data-acquisition process - deciding whether to sample or not - can result in transformative energy-efficiency gains. However, making such a decision in a deterministic manner involves risk of losing information. Here we present a sensing paradigm that enables making such a decision in a probabilistic manner. The paradigm takes inspiration from the autonomous nervous system and employs a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) driven by an analog feature extraction circuit. The response time of the system is on the order of microseconds, over-coming the sub-sampling-rate response time limit and enabling real-time intelligent autonomous activation of data-sampling. Validation experiments on active seismic survey data demonstrate lossless probabilistic data acquisition, with a normalized mean squared error of 0.41%, and 93% saving in the active operation time of the system and the number of generated samples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MeanCache is a training-free caching framework for efficient Flow Matching inference, using average-velocity perspective and trajectory-stability scheduling to outperform existing methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing caching methods rely on instantaneous velocity information, causing trajectory deviations and error accumulation under high acceleration ratios. MeanCache aims to address these issues.

Method: MeanCache leverages cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities and employs a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy for stable cache timing and JVP reuse.

Result: Experiments show MeanCache achieves 4.12X, 4.56X, and 3.59X acceleration on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while maintaining superior generation quality.

Conclusion: MeanCache offers a simple yet effective solution for Flow Matching inference, paving the way for stability-driven acceleration in large-scale generative models.

Abstract: We present MeanCache, a training-free caching framework for efficient Flow Matching inference. Existing caching methods reduce redundant computation but typically rely on instantaneous velocity information (e.g., feature caching), which often leads to severe trajectory deviations and error accumulation under high acceleration ratios. MeanCache introduces an average-velocity perspective: by leveraging cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities from instantaneous velocities, it effectively mitigates local error accumulation. To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality. We believe this simple yet effective approach provides a new perspective for Flow Matching inference and will inspire further exploration of stability-driven acceleration in commercial-scale generative models.

*Canyang Zhao,Bolin Peng,J. Patrick Mayo,Ce Ju,Bing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes TCLA, a framework addressing cross-session neural decoding challenges by aligning latent representations task-conditioned, improving performance with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-session nonstationarity in neural activity hinders BCIs' decoder generalization; limited new-session data exacerbates retraining.

Method: TCLA uses an autoencoder to learn low-dimensional neural dynamics from a source session, then aligns target session data task-conditioned.

Result: TCLA outperforms baselines, boosting decoding performance (e.g., 0.386 gain in R² for velocity decoding in motor tasks).

Conclusion: TCLA effectively transfers knowledge across sessions, enhancing neural decoding robustness with limited data.

Abstract: Cross-session nonstationarity in neural activity recorded by implanted electrodes is a major challenge for invasive Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as decoders trained on data from one session often fail to generalize to subsequent sessions. This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.

*Mingxuan Luo,Guipeng Xv,Sishuo Chen,Xinyu Li,Li Zhang,Zhangming Chan,Xiang-Rong Sheng,Han Zhu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng,Chen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CASCADE, a dataset for NetCVR prediction, and TESLA, a framework addressing cascaded delays and temporal dynamics, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CVR ignores refund behavior, limiting recommendation effectiveness. NetCVR better captures true satisfaction and business value but involves complex cascaded delays lacking datasets and training schemes.

Method: Proposes TESLA with a CVR-refund-rate cascaded architecture, stage-wise debiasing, and delay-time-aware ranking loss, using the CASCADE dataset for continuous modeling.

Result: TESLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving RI-AUC by 12.41 percent and RI-PRAUC by 14.94 percent on NetCVR prediction.

Conclusion: TESLA effectively addresses NetCVR challenges with cascaded modeling and temporal dynamics, validated by superior performance on CASCADE.

Abstract: In industrial recommender systems, conversion rate (CVR) is widely used for traffic allocation, but it fails to fully reflect recommendation effectiveness because it ignores refund behavior. To better capture true user satisfaction and business value, net conversion rate (NetCVR), defined as the probability that a clicked item is purchased and not refunded, has been proposed.Unlike CVR, NetCVR prediction involves a more complex multi-stage cascaded delayed feedback process. The two cascaded delays from click to conversion and from conversion to refund have opposite effects, making traditional CVR modeling methods inapplicable. Moreover, the lack of open-source datasets and online continuous training schemes further hinders progress in this area.To address these challenges, we introduce CASCADE (Cascaded Sequences of Conversion and Delayed Refund), the first large-scale open dataset derived from the Taobao app for online continuous NetCVR prediction. Through an in-depth analysis of CASCADE, we identify three key insights: (1) NetCVR exhibits strong temporal dynamics, necessitating online continuous modeling; (2) cascaded modeling of CVR and refund rate outperforms direct NetCVR modeling; and (3) delay time, which correlates with both CVR and refund rate, is an important feature for NetCVR prediction.Based on these insights, we propose TESLA, a continuous NetCVR modeling framework featuring a CVR-refund-rate cascaded architecture, stage-wise debiasing, and a delay-time-aware ranking loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TESLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CASCADE, achieving absolute improvements of 12.41 percent in RI-AUC and 14.94 percent in RI-PRAUC on NetCVR prediction. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/alimama-tech/NetCVR.

TL;DR: PIL introduces perturbations using linear surrogate models for efficient unlearnable example generation, reducing computational costs while maintaining effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about unauthorized data usage in deep learning models by creating unlearnable examples.

Method: Proposes Perturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL), generating perturbations via linear surrogate models.

Result: PIL matches or outperforms existing methods computationally efficiently and reveals linearization as a key mechanism.

Conclusion: PIL offers a practical, efficient solution for data protection and insights into unlearnable example effectiveness.

Abstract: Collecting web data to train deep models has become increasingly common, raising concerns about unauthorized data usage. To mitigate this issue, unlearnable examples introduce imperceptible perturbations into data, preventing models from learning effectively. However, existing methods typically rely on deep neural networks as surrogate models for perturbation generation, resulting in significant computational costs. In this work, we propose Perturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL), a computationally efficient yet effective method that generates perturbations using only linear surrogate models. PIL achieves comparable or better performance than existing surrogate-based methods while reducing computational time dramatically. We further reveal a key mechanism underlying unlearnable examples: inducing linearization to deep models, which explains why PIL can achieve competitive results in a very short time. Beyond this, we provide an analysis about the property of unlearnable examples under percentage-based partial perturbation. Our work not only provides a practical approach for data protection but also offers insights into what makes unlearnable examples effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing class imbalance and scarcity of labeled defective samples in industrial anomaly detection, particularly in few-shot settings.

Method: Replaces deterministic prototypes with task-specific probabilistic normality models, uses NIW prior for embeddings, and extends to federated meta-learning with contrastive regularization.

Result: Significant AUROC improvements over MAML, Proto-MAML, and PatchCore-based methods on MVTec AD benchmark.

Conclusion: BayPrAnoMeta outperforms existing methods, proving effective for few-shot anomaly detection in industrial settings.

Abstract: Industrial image anomaly detection is a challenging problem owing to extreme class imbalance and the scarcity of labeled defective samples, particularly in few-shot settings. We propose BayPrAnoMeta, a Bayesian generalization of Proto-MAML for few-shot industrial image anomaly detection. Unlike existing Proto-MAML approaches that rely on deterministic class prototypes and distance-based adaptation, BayPrAnoMeta replaces prototypes with task-specific probabilistic normality models and performs inner-loop adaptation via a Bayesian posterior predictive likelihood. We model normal support embeddings with a Normal-Inverse-Wishart (NIW) prior, producing a Student-$t$ predictive distribution that enables uncertainty-aware, heavy-tailed anomaly scoring and is essential for robustness in extreme few-shot settings. We further extend BayPrAnoMeta to a federated meta-learning framework with supervised contrastive regularization for heterogeneous industrial clients and prove convergence to stationary points of the resulting nonconvex objective. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate consistent and significant AUROC improvements over MAML, Proto-MAML, and PatchCore-based methods in few-shot anomaly detection settings.

*Chiraag Kaushik,Davis Barch,Andrea Fanelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes adapting sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for multimodal embeddings to improve alignment and interpretability, introducing cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of split dictionaries in SAEs when applied to multimodal embeddings, aiming to improve modality alignment and feature semanticity.

Method: Introduces cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization to adapt SAEs for multimodal embeddings, applied to CLIP and CLAP embeddings.

Result: The approach learns a more multimodal dictionary, reduces dead neurons, and improves feature semanticity, enhancing interpretability and control in cross-modal tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully improves multimodal alignment and interpretability in SAEs for multimodal embeddings.

Abstract: The Linear Representation Hypothesis asserts that the embeddings learned by neural networks can be understood as linear combinations of features corresponding to high-level concepts. Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn "split dictionaries", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity. We finally demonstrate how this improvement in alignment of concepts between modalities can enable improvements in the interpretability and control of cross-modal tasks.

TL;DR: StructuralCFN introduces Relation-Aware Inductive Bias via differentiable structural priors to improve deep learning performance on tabular data while maintaining interpretability and compactness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning architectures underperform gradient-boosted decision trees on tabular data and lack interpretability, failing to exploit structural dependencies.

Method: StructuralCFN models features as compositions using Differentiable Adaptive Gating and integrates domain-specific relational priors.

Result: Achieves significant improvements on scientific and clinical datasets, with a compact parameter footprint and human-readable mathematical expressions.

Conclusion: StructuralCFN outperforms standard deep baselines, offering interpretability and efficiency for tabular data.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of tabular data in high-stakes domains, traditional deep learning architectures often struggle to match the performance of gradient-boosted decision trees while maintaining scientific interpretability. Standard neural networks typically treat features as independent entities, failing to exploit the inherent manifold structural dependencies that define tabular distributions. We propose Structural Compositional Function Networks (StructuralCFN), a novel architecture that imposes a Relation-Aware Inductive Bias via a differentiable structural prior. StructuralCFN explicitly models each feature as a mathematical composition of its counterparts through Differentiable Adaptive Gating, which automatically discovers the optimal activation physics (e.g., attention-style filtering vs. inhibitory polarity) for each relationship. Our framework enables Structured Knowledge Integration, allowing domain-specific relational priors to be injected directly into the architecture to guide discovery. We evaluate StructuralCFN across a rigorous 10-fold cross-validation suite on 18 benchmarks, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) on scientific and clinical datasets (e.g., Blood Transfusion, Ozone, WDBC). Furthermore, StructuralCFN provides Intrinsic Symbolic Interpretability: it recovers the governing "laws" of the data manifold as human-readable mathematical expressions while maintaining a compact parameter footprint (300--2,500 parameters) that is over an order of magnitude (10x--20x) smaller than standard deep baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized virtual assistants using RAG on edge devices face efficiency and accuracy issues due to growing profile data and environmental noise, particularly in dynamic, multi-domain scenarios.

Method: TONEL incorporates a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware, improving retrieval precision under noisy conditions.

Result: Experiments on personalization benchmarks show TONEL's effectiveness in noisy, task-specific edge environments compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: TONEL successfully addresses the challenges of noise and domain adaptability in RAG deployment on edge devices, offering a practical solution for accurate and efficient personalized virtual assistants.

Abstract: Personalized virtual assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) on edge devices are attracting growing attention, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a key method for personalization by retrieving relevant profile data and generating tailored responses. However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on personalization benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our methods relative to strong baselines, especially in task-specific noisy scenarios.

TL;DR: RAMBO proposes a Dirichlet Process Mixture of Gaussian Processes to handle multi-regime optimization problems by discovering latent regimes and modeling each with an independent GP, improving performance over standard BO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard BO assumes uniform smoothness, which fails in multi-regime problems like molecular conformation search or drug discovery. RAMBO addresses this by adapting to varying smoothness levels.

Method: RAMBO uses a Dirichlet Process Mixture of GPs to automatically discover latent regimes, each modeled with an independent GP. It employs collapsed Gibbs sampling and adaptive concentration parameter scheduling for efficient inference.

Result: Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications (e.g., molecular conformer optimization, drug discovery) show RAMBO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multi-regime objectives.

Conclusion: RAMBO effectively handles multi-regime optimization by dynamically adapting to varying smoothness, offering significant improvements in diverse applications.

Abstract: Standard Bayesian Optimization (BO) assumes uniform smoothness across the search space an assumption violated in multi-regime problems such as molecular conformation search through distinct energy basins or drug discovery across heterogeneous molecular scaffolds. A single GP either oversmooths sharp transitions or hallucinates noise in smooth regions, yielding miscalibrated uncertainty. We propose RAMBO, a Dirichlet Process Mixture of Gaussian Processes that automatically discovers latent regimes during optimization, each modeled by an independent GP with locally-optimized hyperparameters. We derive collapsed Gibbs sampling that analytically marginalizes latent functions for efficient inference, and introduce adaptive concentration parameter scheduling for coarse-to-fine regime discovery. Our acquisition functions decompose uncertainty into intra-regime and inter-regime components. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, including molecular conformer optimization, virtual screening for drug discovery, and fusion reactor design, demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on multi-regime objectives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study developed and validated a visit-level 180-day mortality risk model for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) using longitudinal data from two Phase III cohorts, comparing five architectures. The GRU and RSF models showed high discrimination, with GRU achieving better calibration and PR-AUC of 0.87.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mCRPC is highly aggressive with poor prognosis and heterogeneous treatment response, necessitating a robust mortality risk model to aid proactive care planning.

Method: The study used longitudinal data from two Phase III cohorts (n=526, n=640), excluding right-censored cases. Five architectures (LSTM, GRU, Cox Proportional Hazards, RSF, Logistic Regression) were compared. Models were evaluated based on sensitivity and calibration.

Result: GRU and RSF showed high discrimination (C-index: 87%). GRU achieved better calibration (slope: 0.93; intercept: 0.07) and PR-AUC of 0.87. Clinical impact analysis revealed median time-in-warning of 151.0 days for true positives and 18.3 alerts per 100 patient-visits.

Conclusion: Longitudinal routine clinical markers can estimate short-horizon mortality risk in mCRPC, supporting proactive care planning over a multi-month window.

Abstract: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a highly aggressive disease with poor prognosis and heterogeneous treatment response. In this work, we developed and externally validated a visit-level 180-day mortality risk model using longitudinal data from two Phase III cohorts (n=526 and n=640). Only visits with observable 180-day outcomes were labeled; right-censored cases were excluded from analysis. We compared five candidate architectures: Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Logistic Regression. For each dataset, we selected the smallest risk-threshold that achieved an 85% sensitivity floor. The GRU and RSF models showed high discrimination capabilities initially (C-index: 87% for both). In external validation, the GRU obtained a higher calibration (slope: 0.93; intercept: 0.07) and achieved an PR-AUC of 0.87. Clinical impact analysis showed a median time-in-warning of 151.0 days for true positives (59.0 days for false positives) and 18.3 alerts per 100 patient-visits. Given late-stage frailty or cachexia and hemodynamic instability, permutation importance ranked BMI and systolic blood pressure as the strongest associations. These results suggest that longitudinal routine clinical markers can estimate short-horizon mortality risk in mCRPC and support proactive care planning over a multi-month window.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Domain Expansion, a framework to prevent latent representation collapse in multi-objective networks by using orthogonal pooling to create mutually orthogonal subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training networks for multiple objectives often leads to conflicting gradients, degrading shared representations and resulting in suboptimal performance for any single task.

Method: The framework employs a novel orthogonal pooling mechanism to restructure the latent space, assigning each objective to a mutually orthogonal subspace.

Result: Validated on diverse benchmarks (ShapeNet, MPIIGaze, Rotated MNIST), the method prevents collapse and produces an interpretable, compositional latent space suitable for direct manipulation.

Conclusion: Domain Expansion effectively addresses representation collapse, offering a structured and interpretable solution for multi-objective learning.

Abstract: Training a single network with multiple objectives often leads to conflicting gradients that degrade shared representations, forcing them into a compromised state that is suboptimal for any single task--a problem we term latent representation collapse. We introduce Domain Expansion, a framework that prevents these conflicts by restructuring the latent space itself. Our framework uses a novel orthogonal pooling mechanism to construct a latent space where each objective is assigned to a mutually orthogonal subspace. We validate our approach across diverse benchmarks--including ShapeNet, MPIIGaze, and Rotated MNIST--on challenging multi-objective problems combining classification with pose and gaze estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that this structure not only prevents collapse but also yields an explicit, interpretable, and compositional latent space where concepts can be directly manipulated.

*Paul Seurin,Dean Price*

TL;DR: The study extends a design optimization framework for heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs) to multi-objective optimization using PEARL, balancing cost and safety while addressing surrogate model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the optimization of HPMRs by minimizing both cost (LCOE) and safety risks ($F_{Δh}$) under constraints, improving remote energy solutions.

Method: Used PEARL algorithm for multi-objective optimization, evaluated three cost scenarios, and identified key design strategies.

Result: Reducing moderator radius, pin pitch, and drum coating angle while increasing fuel height lowers $F_{Δh}$. Four strategies consistently optimized LCOE across scenarios.

Conclusion: PEARL shows potential for balancing HPMR design trade-offs, but further surrogate model refinement and constraint relaxation are needed.

Abstract: Heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs) are compact and transportable nuclear power systems exhibiting inherent safety, well-suited for deployment in remote regions where access is limited and reliance on costly fossil fuels is prevalent. In prior work, we developed a design optimization framework that incorporates techno-economic considerations through surrogate modeling and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, focusing solely on minimizing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by using a bottom-up cost estimation approach. In this study, we extend that framework to a multi-objective optimization that uses the Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning (PEARL) algorithm. The objectives include minimizing both the rod-integrated peaking factor ($F_{Δh}$) and LCOE -- subject to safety and operational constraints. We evaluate three cost scenarios: (1) a high-cost axial and drum reflectors, (2) a low-cost axial reflector, and (3) low-cost axial and drum reflectors. Our findings indicate that reducing the solid moderator radius, pin pitch, and drum coating angle -- all while increasing the fuel height -- effectively lowers $F_{Δh}$. Across all three scenarios, four key strategies consistently emerged for optimizing LCOE: (1) minimizing the axial reflector contribution when costly, (2) reducing control drum reliance, (3) substituting expensive tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel with axial reflector material priced at the level of graphite, and (4) maximizing fuel burnup. While PEARL demonstrates promise in navigating trade-offs across diverse design scenarios, discrepancies between surrogate model predictions and full-order simulations remain. Further improvements are anticipated through constraint relaxation and surrogate development, constituting an ongoing area of investigation.

TL;DR: QAD (quantization-aware distillation) effectively recovers accuracy in quantized LLMs and VLMs by distilling a full-precision teacher into a quantized student, overcoming challenges in traditional QAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and instability of traditional quantization-aware training (QAT) for multi-stage post-trained models and improve accuracy recovery without requiring full training data.

Method: Uses KL divergence loss to distill knowledge from a full-precision teacher model into a quantized student model.

Result: Demonstrates consistent recovery to near-BF16 accuracy across various post-trained models like AceReason Nemotron and Llama Nemotron Super v1.

Conclusion: QAD is a robust and effective method for accuracy recovery in quantized LLMs and VLMs, especially for models trained through multi-stage pipelines.

Abstract: This technical report presents quantization-aware distillation (QAD) and our best practices for recovering accuracy of NVFP4-quantized large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). QAD distills a full-precision teacher model into a quantized student model using a KL divergence loss. While applying distillation to quantized models is not a new idea, we observe key advantages of QAD for today's LLMs: 1. It shows remarkable effectiveness and stability for models trained through multi-stage post-training pipelines, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and model merging, where traditional quantization-aware training (QAT) suffers from engineering complexity and training instability; 2. It is robust to data quality and coverage, enabling accuracy recovery without full training data. We evaluate QAD across multiple post-trained models including AceReason Nemotron, Nemotron 3 Nano, Nemotron Nano V2, Nemotron Nano V2 VL (VLM), and Llama Nemotron Super v1, showing consistent recovery to near-BF16 accuracy.

### [173] [In-Context Reinforcement Learning From Suboptimal Historical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20116)
*Juncheng Dong,Moyang Guo,Ethan X. Fang,Zhuoran Yang,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decision Importance Transformer (DIT), a framework for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) that improves performance with suboptimal offline datasets by combining transformer-based value functions and weighted policy training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models excel in in-context learning, inspiring their application to ICRL. The challenge lies in leveraging suboptimal historical data effectively.

Method: DIT trains a transformer-based value function to estimate advantages of behavior policies, then uses weighted maximum likelihood estimation to refine policies.

Result: DIT outperforms standard methods, especially with suboptimal datasets, validated on bandit and MDP problems.

Conclusion: DIT successfully adapts transformer models to ICRL, enhancing performance with suboptimal data by integrating value estimation and policy optimization.

Abstract: Transformer models have achieved remarkable empirical successes, largely due to their in-context learning capabilities. Inspired by this, we explore training an autoregressive transformer for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). In this setting, we initially train a transformer on an offline dataset consisting of trajectories collected from various RL tasks, and then fix and use this transformer to create an action policy for new RL tasks. Notably, we consider the setting where the offline dataset contains trajectories sampled from suboptimal behavioral policies. In this case, standard autoregressive training corresponds to imitation learning and results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Decision Importance Transformer(DIT) framework, which emulates the actor-critic algorithm in an in-context manner. In particular, we first train a transformer-based value function that estimates the advantage functions of the behavior policies that collected the suboptimal trajectories. Then we train a transformer-based policy via a weighted maximum likelihood estimation loss, where the weights are constructed based on the trained value function to steer the suboptimal policies to the optimal ones. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of DIT on both bandit and Markov Decision Process problems. Our results show that DIT achieves superior performance, particularly when the offline dataset contains suboptimal historical data.

Motivation: To advance Polar code design for 6G applications by creating an extensible and adaptable framework.

Method: Reinforcement learning-based universal sequence design incorporating physical law constraints, weak long-term influence exploitation, and joint multi-configuration optimization.

Result: Achieves competitive performance relative to 5G NR sequences and up to 0.2 dB gain over beta-expansion baseline at N=2048.

Conclusion: The framework successfully scales and adapts to diverse conditions, making it suitable for standardization.

Abstract: To advance Polar code design for 6G applications, we develop a reinforcement learning-based universal sequence design framework that is extensible and adaptable to diverse channel conditions and decoding strategies. Crucially, our method scales to code lengths up to $2048$, making it suitable for use in standardization. Across all $(N,K)$ configurations supported in 5G, our approach achieves competitive performance relative to the NR sequence adopted in 5G and yields up to a 0.2 dB gain over the beta-expansion baseline at $N=2048$. We further highlight the key elements that enabled learning at scale: (i) incorporation of physical law constrained learning grounded in the universal partial order property of Polar codes, (ii) exploitation of the weak long term influence of decisions to limit lookahead evaluation, and (iii) joint multi-configuration optimization to increase learning efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reimplementation of Facebook Prophet in PyMC addresses limitations in inference methods and API flexibility, enabling comparison of Bayesian techniques like MCMC, MAP, and Variational Inference for time-series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The default inference methods and API design of Facebook Prophet were restrictive for custom modeling and alternative Bayesian techniques.

Method: Reimplemented Prophet in PyMC to extend the base model and evaluate MCMC, MAP, and Variational Inference techniques.

Result: Detailed analysis of sampling, convergence diagnostics, forecasting metrics, and computational efficiency, identifying issues for future work.

Conclusion: The PyMC-based implementation provides flexibility for advanced Bayesian inference in time-series forecasting, with further improvements planned.

Abstract: Since its introduction, Facebook Prophet has attracted positive attention from both classical statisticians and the Bayesian statistics community. The model provides two built-in inference methods: maximum a posteriori estimation using the L-BFGS-B algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling via the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). While exploring various time-series forecasting problems using Bayesian inference with Prophet, we encountered limitations stemming from the inability to apply alternative inference techniques beyond those provided by default. Additionally, the fluent API design of Facebook Prophet proved insufficiently flexible for implementing our custom modeling ideas. To address these shortcomings, we developed a complete reimplementation of the Prophet model in PyMC, which enables us to extend the base model and evaluate and compare multiple Bayesian inference methods. In this paper, we present our PyMC-based implementation and analyze in detail the implementation of different Bayesian inference techniques. We consider full MCMC techniques, MAP estimation and Variational inference techniques on a time-series forecasting problem. We discuss in details the sampling approach, convergence diagnostics, forecasting metrics as well as their computational efficiency and detect possible issues which will be addressed in our future work.

TL;DR: The paper investigates privacy vulnerabilities in Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) via Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) and introduces SAMA, a novel attack method that outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLMs are promising but underexplored for privacy risks. Their bidirectional prediction increases attack opportunities compared to autoregressive models.

Method: The paper introduces SAMA, which uses masked subset sampling across densities, sign-based statistics, and inverse-weighted aggregation to detect memorization.

Result: SAMA improves AUC by 30% over baselines, with up to 8x better performance at low false positive rates on nine datasets.

Conclusion: DLMs have significant privacy vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for tailored defenses.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) represent a promising alternative to autoregressive language models, using bidirectional masked token prediction. Yet their susceptibility to privacy leakage via Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) remains critically underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of MIA vulnerabilities in DLMs. Unlike the autoregressive models' single fixed prediction pattern, DLMs' multiple maskable configurations exponentially increase attack opportunities. This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism. Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates. These findings reveal significant, previously unknown vulnerabilities in DLMs, necessitating the development of tailored privacy defenses.

*Richard Csaky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A large autoregressive model predicts and generates long-context MEG brain activity, demonstrating stability and specificity across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scale next-token prediction for MEG brain activity across diverse datasets and scanners, enabling long-context generation and evaluation.

Method: Uses a modified SEANet-style vector-quantizer to tokenize MEG data, trains a Qwen2.5-VL backbone for prediction, and evaluates with task-matched tests.

Result: Generations remain stable over long rollouts and outperform swapped controls in specificity.

Conclusion: The model effectively generalizes across datasets, offering promising tools for MEG analysis.

Abstract: We present a large autoregressive model for source-space MEG that scales next-token prediction to long context across datasets and scanners: handling a corpus of over 500 hours and thousands of sessions across the three largest MEG datasets. A modified SEANet-style vector-quantizer reduces multichannel MEG into a flattened token stream on which we train a Qwen2.5-VL backbone from scratch to predict the next brain token and to recursively generate minutes of MEG from up to a minute of context. To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce three task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization. Across metrics, generations remain relatively stable over long rollouts and are closer to the correct continuation than swapped controls. Code available at: https://github.com/ricsinaruto/brain-gen.

*Bo Dai,Na Li,Dale Schuurmans*

TL;DR: The paper explores a unified theoretical framework for self-supervised learning (SSL) to address the lack of clear understanding and principles in representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of SSL methods has highlighted the absence of a unified understanding, theoretical foundation, and efficient design principles, which hampers progress and practical application.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze the sufficiency of representations from a spectral perspective, linking it to existing successful SSL algorithms and proposing a unified framework.

Result: The study reveals the spectral essence of SSL algorithms, providing a foundation for understanding, analyzing, and improving representation learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework aims to inspire more efficient and practical SSL algorithms while offering a principled way to understand and apply representation learning.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) have improved empirical performance by unleashing the power of unlabeled data for practical applications. Specifically, SSL extracts the representation from massive unlabeled data, which will be transferred to a plenty of down streaming tasks with limited data. The significant improvement on diverse applications of representation learning has attracted increasing attention, resulting in a variety of dramatically different self-supervised learning objectives for representation extraction, with an assortment of learning procedures, but the lack of a clear and unified understanding. Such an absence hampers the ongoing development of representation learning, leaving a theoretical understanding missing, principles for efficient algorithm design unclear, and the use of representation learning methods in practice unjustified. The urgency for a unified framework is further motivated by the rapid growth in representation learning methods. In this paper, we are therefore compelled to develop a principled foundation of representation learning. We first theoretically investigate the sufficiency of the representation from a spectral representation view, which reveals the spectral essence of the existing successful SSL algorithms and paves the path to a unified framework for understanding and analysis. Such a framework work also inspires the development of more efficient and easy-to-use representation learning algorithms with principled way in real-world applications.

*Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,My Duong,Ying Mao,Kaixun Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PASS is a scalable framework for pairwise-constrained clustering that uses pseudo-points and selectors to handle constraints efficiently, outperforming existing methods in cost and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for pairwise-constrained clustering struggle with scalability, especially in niche applications like quantum clustering. PASS aims to address this by preserving constraint satisfaction while enabling scalable solutions.

Method: PASS collapses must-link constraints into pseudo-points and employs two selection rules: a constraint-aware margin rule for near-boundary points and CL violations, and an information-geometric rule scoring points via Fisher-Rao distance to select high-information subsets under a budget.

Result: PASS achieves competitive SSE (sum of squared errors) at much lower computational cost than exact or penalty-based methods, and performs well where other approaches fail.

Conclusion: PASS offers an effective and scalable solution for pairwise-constrained clustering, particularly in challenging scenarios, by balancing constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Pairwise-constrained clustering augments unsupervised partitioning with side information by enforcing must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraints between specific samples, yielding labelings that respect known affinities and separations. However, ML and CL constraints add an extra layer of complexity to the clustering problem, with current methods struggling in data scalability, especially in niche applications like quantum or quantum-hybrid clustering. We propose PASS, a pairwise-constraints and ambiguity-driven subset selection framework that preserves ML and CL constraints satisfaction while allowing scalable, high-quality clustering solution. PASS collapses ML constraints into pseudo-points and offers two selectors: a constraint-aware margin rule that collects near-boundary points and all detected CL violations, and an information-geometric rule that scores points via a Fisher-Rao distance derived from soft assignment posteriors, then selects the highest-information subset under a simple budget. Across diverse benchmarks, PASS attains competitive SSE at substantially lower cost than exact or penalty-based methods, and remains effective in regimes where prior approaches fail.

*Jim Maar,Denis Paperno,Callum Stuart McDougall,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates simple techniques to assess implicit planning in language models, showing it's a universal mechanism present even in smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and assess implicit planning behavior in language models, which can inform AI safety and control decisions.

Method: Uses case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering to manipulate predictions by steering vectors.

Result: Implicit planning is found in models as small as 1B parameters, and generated outputs can be controlled by steering vectors.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a direct way to study implicit planning in LLMs, revealing its universality and potential impact on AI safety.

Abstract: Prior work suggests that language models, while trained on next token prediction, show implicit planning behavior: they may select the next token in preparation to a predicted future token, such as a likely rhyming word, as supported by a prior qualitative study of Claude 3.5 Haiku using a cross-layer transcoder. We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. "-ight") or answer to a question ("whale") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters. Our methodology offers a widely applicable direct way to study implicit planning abilities of LLMs. More broadly, understanding planning abilities of language models can inform decisions in AI safety and control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a local duality theory for sparse support vector machines (SSVMs), linking them to 0/1-loss SVM and providing theoretical justification for their empirical advantages over hinge-loss and ramp-loss SVMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical justification for SSVMs derived by adding cardinality functions to convex SVMs, and to explore their relationship with other SVM variants.

Method: Develops a local duality theory for SSVMs, proves their dual relationship with 0/1-loss SVM, and analyzes connections to hinge-loss and ramp-loss SVMs.

Result: SSVMs are shown to be dual to 0/1-loss SVM, with local solutions guiding hyperparameter selection for other SVMs. Empirical tests confirm SSVM advantages.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical and empirical support for SSVMs, demonstrating their superiority under specific conditions and offering practical insights for SVM applications.

Abstract: Due to the rise of cardinality minimization in optimization, sparse support vector machines (SSVMs) have attracted much attention lately and show certain empirical advantages over convex SVMs. A common way to derive an SSVM is to add a cardinality function such as $\ell_0$-norm to the dual problem of a convex SVM. However, this process lacks theoretical justification. This paper fills the gap by developing a local duality theory for such an SSVM formulation and exploring its relationship with the hinge-loss SVM (hSVM) and the ramp-loss SVM (rSVM). In particular, we prove that the derived SSVM is exactly the dual problem of the 0/1-loss SVM, and the linear representer theorem holds for their local solutions. The local solution of SSVM also provides guidelines on selecting hyperparameters of hSVM and rSVM. {Under specific conditions, we show that a sequence of global solutions of hSVM converges to a local solution of 0/1-loss SVM. Moreover, a local minimizer of 0/1-loss SVM is a local minimizer of rSVM.} This explains why a local solution induced by SSVM outperforms hSVM and rSVM in the prior empirical study. We further conduct numerical tests on real datasets and demonstrate potential advantages of SSVM by working with locally nice solutions proposed in this paper.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an influence-based diagnostic to measure how neural emulators of PDE solution operators internalize physical symmetries, going beyond equivariance tests by analyzing learning dynamics. Applied to fluid flow emulators, it reveals symmetry-compatible generalization mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if surrogate models truly internalize symmetries of known PDE solution operators, beyond just forward-pass equivariance.

Method: Proposes an influence-based diagnostic measuring gradient coherence along symmetry group orbits to assess learning dynamics.

Result: Demonstrates orbit-wise gradient coherence as a mechanism for symmetry generalization and identifies symmetry-compatible training basins.

Conclusion: Provides a novel technique to assess symmetry internalization in surrogate models, validated through fluid flow emulators.

Abstract: We study how neural emulators of partial differential equation solution operators internalize physical symmetries by introducing an influence-based diagnostic that measures the propagation of parameter updates between symmetry-related states, defined as the metric-weighted overlap of loss gradients evaluated along group orbits. This quantity probes the local geometry of the learned loss landscape and goes beyond forward-pass equivariance tests by directly assessing whether learning dynamics couple physically equivalent configurations. Applying our diagnostic to autoregressive fluid flow emulators, we show that orbit-wise gradient coherence provides the mechanism for learning to generalize over symmetry transformations and indicates when training selects a symmetry compatible basin. The result is a novel technique for evaluating if surrogate models have internalized symmetry properties of the known solution operator.

TL;DR: MAPLE is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that improves UMAP by using self-supervised learning and MMCRs for better manifold modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance manifold modeling in dimensionality reduction, especially for high-dimensional data with complex structures like biological or image data.

Method: MAPLE uses self-supervised learning and MMCRs to compress variances among similar points and amplify variances among dissimilar points.

Result: MAPLE produces clearer cluster separations and finer subcluster resolution than UMAP with similar computational cost.

Conclusion: MAPLE outperforms UMAP in manifold modeling efficiency and visual clarity for complex datasets.

Abstract: We present a new nonlinear dimensionality reduction method, MAPLE, that enhances UMAP by improving manifold modeling. MAPLE employs a self-supervised learning approach to more efficiently encode low-dimensional manifold geometry. Central to this approach are maximum manifold capacity representations (MMCRs), which help untangle complex manifolds by compressing variances among locally similar data points while amplifying variance among dissimilar data points. This design is particularly effective for high-dimensional data with substantial intra-cluster variance and curved manifold structures, such as biological or image data. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MAPLE can produce clearer visual cluster separations and finer subcluster resolution than UMAP while maintaining comparable computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuraLSP is a novel neural preconditioner using GNNs and a unique loss metric for solving PDEs, achieving faster convergence and robustness against rank inflation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural methods for solving PDEs suffer from rank inflation and suboptimal convergence due to aggregation of discretized matrices into graphs.

Method: Proposes NeuraLSP, combining GNNs with a loss metric based on the left singular subspace of near-nullspace vectors, compressing spectral info into a low-rank operator.

Result: Achieves up to 53% speedup, with theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness across diverse PDEs.

Conclusion: NeuraLSP offers improved convergence and robustness, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Numerical techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) are integral for many fields across science and engineering. Such techniques usually involve solving large, sparse linear systems, where preconditioning methods are critical. In recent years, neural methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated their potential through accelerated convergence. Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate. In this paper, we articulate NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner combined with a novel loss metric that leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors. By compressing spectral information into a fixed low-rank operator, our method exhibits both theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness to rank inflation, affording up to a 53% speedup. Besides the theoretical guarantees for our newly-formulated loss function, our comprehensive experimental results across diverse families of PDEs also substantiate the aforementioned theoretical advances.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization by proposing a causal framework to evaluate representation effectiveness, outperforming traditional domain-invariant methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD methods rely on domain-invariant features, which may not be causally effective. The paper aims to improve robustness by focusing on causal necessity and sufficiency.

Method: Introduces a segment-level framework to directly measure causal effectiveness of representations across domains.

Result: Experiments show consistent OOD performance improvements, especially under challenging domain shifts.

Conclusion: Causal evaluation provides a more reliable criterion for OOD generalization than invariance alone.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a fundamental challenge in real-world classification, where test distributions often differ substantially from training data. Most existing approaches pursue domain-invariant representations, implicitly assuming that invariance implies reliability. However, features that are invariant across domains are not necessarily causally effective for prediction.
  In this work, we revisit OOD classification from a causal perspective and propose to evaluate learned representations based on their necessity and sufficiency under distribution shift. We introduce an explicit segment-level framework that directly measures causal effectiveness across domains, providing a more faithful criterion than invariance alone.
  Experiments on multi-domain benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in OOD performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts, highlighting the value of causal evaluation for robust generalization.

*Ioannis Anagnostides,Rohan Chauhan,Ioannis Panageas,Tuomas Sandholm,Jingming Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the complexity of performative prediction, showing a phase transition where computing stable points becomes PPAD-complete even for weak performative effects, and extends this hardness to convex domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational complexity of performative prediction, particularly when performative effects are strong, and to bridge gaps in previous work by addressing both quadratic loss functions and linear distribution shifts.

Method: The study establishes PPAD-completeness for computing performatively stable points, extends this to general convex domains, and addresses strategic classification by proving PLS-hardness for strategic local optima.

Result: A sharp phase transition is demonstrated: computing stable points becomes intractable (PPAD-complete) even for weak performative effects, and this extends to convex domains. Strategic classification is shown to be PLS-hard.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the inherent computational challenges in performative prediction, even in seemingly simple settings, and provide insights into the complexity of variational inequalities and strategic classification.

Abstract: Performative prediction captures the phenomenon where deploying a predictive model shifts the underlying data distribution. While simple retraining dynamics are known to converge linearly when the performative effects are weak ($ρ< 1$), the complexity in the regime $ρ> 1$ was hitherto open. In this paper, we establish a sharp phase transition: computing an $ε$-performatively stable point is PPAD-complete -- and thus polynomial-time equivalent to Nash equilibria in general-sum games -- even when $ρ= 1 + O(ε)$. This intractability persists even in the ostensibly simple setting with a quadratic loss function and linear distribution shifts. One of our key technical contributions is to extend this PPAD-hardness result to general convex domains, which is of broader interest in the complexity of variational inequalities. Finally, we address the special case of strategic classification, showing that computing a strategic local optimum is PLS-hard.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a meta-cognitive reinforcement learning framework to assess and regulate learning behavior using reliability signals, improving robustness against noise and late-stage failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust reinforcement learning methods lack the ability to self-assess reliability, leading to over-conservatism or catastrophic failures under uncertainty.

Method: The framework introduces a meta-trust variable based on Value Prediction Error Stability (VPES) to modulate learning dynamics through fail-safe regulation and gradual trust recovery.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves higher average returns and reduces late-stage training failures in continuous-control benchmarks with reward corruption.

Conclusion: Meta-cognitive reinforcement learning, enabled by VPES-based trust regulation, enhances robustness and performance in noisy environments.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning methods typically focus on suppressing unreliable experiences or corrupted rewards, but they lack the ability to reason about the reliability of their own learning process. As a result, such methods often either overreact to noise by becoming overly conservative or fail catastrophically when uncertainty accumulates.
  In this work, we propose a meta-cognitive reinforcement learning framework that enables an agent to assess, regulate, and recover its learning behavior based on internally estimated reliability signals. The proposed method introduces a meta-trust variable driven by Value Prediction Error Stability (VPES), which modulates learning dynamics via fail-safe regulation and gradual trust recovery.
  Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks with reward corruption demonstrate that recovery-enabled meta-cognitive control achieves higher average returns and significantly reduces late-stage training failures compared to strong robustness baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeRaDiff introduces a denoising time realignment procedure to modulate regularization strength during sampling, avoiding costly alignment sweeps while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Choosing the right regularization strength for aligning diffusion models with human preferences is challenging and expensive due to the need for trial-and-error sweeps.

Method: DeRaDiff replaces the reverse step reference distribution with a geometric mixture of aligned and reference posteriors, enabling dynamic control with a single parameter.

Result: DeRaDiff approximates models trained at various regularization strengths without additional training, reducing computational costs significantly.

Conclusion: DeRaDiff offers an efficient solution for finding optimal regularization strengths, eliminating the need for expensive alignment sweeps.

Abstract: Recent advances align diffusion models with human preferences to increase aesthetic appeal and mitigate artifacts and biases. Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to "reward hacking". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control. Our experiments show that across multiple text image alignment and image-quality metrics, our method consistently provides a strong approximation for models aligned entirely from scratch at different regularization strengths. Thus, our method yields an efficient way to search for the optimal strength, eliminating the need for expensive alignment sweeps and thereby substantially reducing computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance classic algorithms like minimum-cost flow with machine-learned predictions, improving efficiency and performance.

Method: Augments the classic $ε$-relaxation minimum-cost flow algorithm with dual prediction, providing bounds on time complexity and sample complexity for PAC-learning.

Result: Empirical validation shows average speedups of $12.74\times$ and $1.64\times$ in traffic networks and chip escape routing, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully integrates ML predictions into classic algorithms, demonstrating practical improvements in efficiency.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that machine-learned predictions can provably improve the performance of classic algorithms. In this work, we propose the first minimum-cost network flow algorithm augmented with a dual prediction. Our method is based on a classic minimum-cost flow algorithm, namely $\varepsilon$-relaxation. We provide time complexity bounds in terms of the infinity norm prediction error, which is both consistent and robust. We also prove sample complexity bounds for PAC-learning the prediction. We empirically validate our theoretical results on two applications of minimum-cost flow, i.e., traffic networks and chip escape routing, in which we learn a fixed prediction, and a feature-based neural network model to infer the prediction, respectively. Experimental results illustrate $12.74\times$ and $1.64\times$ average speedup on two applications.

*Tianze Jiang,Blake Bordelon,Cengiz Pehlevan,Boris Hanin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE layers improve neural network scalability but introduce training complexities. A new parameterization method simplifies hyperparameter tuning across models of varying sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the hyperparameter tuning challenges in sparse MoE layers for scalable transformer models.

Method: Proposed a new parameterization approach validated by dynamical mean-field theory, enabling reliable hyperparameter transfer.

Result: Effective hyperparameter transfer demonstrated across models from 51M to over 2B parameters, improving training efficiency.

Conclusion: The parameterization method simplifies and enhances scalability in MoE-based transformer models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers have emerged as an important tool in scaling up modern neural networks by decoupling total trainable parameters from activated parameters in the forward pass for each token. However, sparse MoEs add complexity to training due to (i) new trainable parameters (router weights) that, like all other parameter groups, require hyperparameter (HP) tuning; (ii) new architecture scale dimensions (number of and size of experts) that must be chosen and potentially taken large. To make HP selection cheap and reliable, we propose a new parameterization for transformer models with MoE layers when scaling model width, depth, number of experts, and expert (hidden) size. Our parameterization is justified by a novel dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) analysis. When varying different model dimensions trained at a fixed token budget, we find empirically that our parameterization enables reliable HP transfer across models from 51M to over 2B total parameters. We further take HPs identified from sweeping small models on a short token horizon to train larger models on longer horizons and report performant model behaviors.

*Jinyang Wu,Shuo Yang,Changpeng Yang,Yuhao Shen,Shuai Zhang,Zhengqi Wen,Jianhua Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spark introduces strategic branching at critical decision points for efficient reinforcement learning in long-horizon tasks, improving success rates with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training reinforcement learning agents for long-horizon tasks is challenging due to scarce high-quality trajectories and inefficient resource allocation in existing methods.

Method: Spark uses adaptive branching at critical states to prioritize promising trajectories, leveraging intrinsic decision-making signals for precise resource allocation.

Result: Spark achieves higher success rates with fewer samples and robust generalization in diverse tasks like embodied planning.

Conclusion: Spark effectively improves resource efficiency and generalization in reinforcement learning for long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has empowered large language models to act as intelligent agents, yet training them for long-horizon tasks remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality trajectories, especially under limited resources. Existing methods typically scale up rollout sizes and indiscriminately allocate computational resources among intermediate steps. Such attempts inherently waste substantial computation budget on trivial steps while failing to guarantee sample quality. To address this, we propose \textbf{Spark} (\textbf{S}trategic \textbf{P}olicy-\textbf{A}ware explo\textbf{R}ation via \textbf{K}ey-state dynamic branching), a novel framework that selectively branches at critical decision states for resource-efficient exploration. Our key insight is to activate adaptive branching exploration at critical decision points to probe promising trajectories, thereby achieving precise resource allocation that prioritizes sampling quality over blind coverage. This design leverages the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals to reduce dependence on human priors, enabling the agent to autonomously expand exploration and achieve stronger generalization. Experiments across diverse tasks (e.g., embodied planning), demonstrate that \textsc{Spark} achieves superior success rates with significantly fewer training samples, exhibiting robust generalization even in unseen scenarios.

### [192] [An Accounting Identity for Algorithmic Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20217)
*Hadi Elzayn,Jacob Goldin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an accounting identity linking model accuracy and fairness criteria, showing that globally calibrated models balance miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups as a 'total unfairness budget.' For binary outcomes, this budget is tied to mean-squared error and group prevalence differences, nesting impossibility results and revealing tradeoffs. Accuracy and fairness are complementary in binary tasks, with experiments confirming fairness interventions often trade fairness violations or expand the unfairness budget. The theory extends to non-binary outcomes, clarifying when impossibility results persist or relax.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the relationship between accuracy and fairness in predictive models, demonstrating inherent tradeoffs and complementarity, while extending understanding beyond binary outcomes.

Method: Derives an accounting identity linking accuracy and fairness, analyzes its implications for binary and non-binary outcomes, and validates the theory with experiments on benchmark data.

Result: The identity shows accuracy and fairness are complementary in binary tasks, with fairness interventions often substituting fairness violations or increasing unfairness budgets. The theory generalizes to non-binary outcomes.

Conclusion: Accuracy and fairness should be viewed as complements, not just tradeoffs, with implications for model design and fairness interventions. The framework extends to broader prediction tasks.

Abstract: We derive an accounting identity for predictive models that links accuracy with common fairness criteria. The identity shows that for globally calibrated models, the weighted sums of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups is equal to a "total unfairness budget." For binary outcomes, this budget is the model's mean-squared error times the difference in group prevalence across outcome classes. The identity nests standard impossibility results as special cases, while also describing inherent tradeoffs when one or more fairness measures are not perfectly satisfied. The results suggest that accuracy and fairness are best viewed as complements in binary prediction tasks: increasing accuracy necessarily shrinks the total unfairness budget and vice-versa. Experiments on benchmark data confirm the theory and show that many fairness interventions largely substitute between fairness violations, and when they reduce accuracy they tend to expand the total unfairness budget. The results extend naturally to prediction tasks with non-binary outcomes, illustrating how additional outcome information can relax fairness incompatibilities and identifying conditions under which the binary-style impossibility does and does not extend to regression tasks.

*Julian Gutierrez,Redouane Silvente*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two ML frameworks for forecasting and optimizing storage in the EPEX SPOT market: a fast parametric model for daily use and generative models for comprehensive analysis, aiding price-making storage strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency in the EPEX SPOT day-ahead market by leveraging machine learning for aggregated curve forecasting and storage optimization.

Method: 1. A parametric model forecasts hourly curves using Chebyshev polynomials for elastic segments. 2. Generative models learn joint distributions of order-level submissions to create synthetic scenarios.

Result: The parametric model offers daily use with low error and interpretability; generative models provide comprehensive analysis. Storage optimization shows price-compression effects.

Conclusion: The frameworks enhance forecasting and storage strategies in energy markets, balancing interpretability and comprehensive analysis.

Abstract: We present two machine learning frameworks for forecasting aggregated curves and optimizing storage in the EPEX SPOT day-ahead market. First, a fast parametric model forecasts hourly demand and supply curves in a low-dimensional and grid-robust representation, with minimum and maximum volumes combined with a Chebyshev polynomial for the elastic segment. The model enables daily use with low error and clear interpretability. Second, for a more comprehensive analysis, though less suited to daily operation, we employ generative models that learn the joint distribution of 24-hour order-level submissions given weather and fuel variables. These models generate synthetic daily scenarios of individual buy and sell orders, which, once aggregated, yield hourly supply and demand curves. Based on these forecasts, we optimize a price-making storage strategy, quantify revenue distributions, and highlight the price-compression effect with lower peaks, higher off-peak levels, and diminishing returns as capacity expands.

*Zichao Yu,Ming Li,Wenyi Zhang,Difan Zou,Weiguo Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProFlow is a framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling that enforces strict PDE constraints and observational fidelity without retraining generative priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of enforcing hard physical constraints in inverse problems using deep generative models, which struggle without costly retraining or disrupting prior learning.

Method: ProFlow uses a proximal guidance framework with a two-step scheme: terminal optimization for physical and observational consistency, and interpolation to align with the generative trajectory.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in physical/observational consistency and distributional accuracy on Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and viscous Burgers' equations.

Conclusion: ProFlow effectively bridges the gap between strict physical constraints and generative priors, offering superior performance in computational physics tasks.

Abstract: Inferring physical fields from sparse observations while strictly satisfying partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Recently, deep generative models offer powerful data-driven priors for such inverse problems, yet existing methods struggle to enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned generative prior. Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates. Comprehensive benchmarks on Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and viscous Burgers' equations demonstrate that ProFlow achieves superior physical and observational consistency, as well as more accurate distributional statistics, compared to state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based baselines.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGP introduces certificate-guided pruning for black-box optimization under noise, ensuring explicit optimality certificates and controlled sample complexity, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack explicit optimality certificates or measurable progress guarantees.

Method: CGP uses confidence-adjusted Lipschitz envelopes to maintain an active set of potentially optimal points and prunes suboptimal regions with high probability. Extensions include adaptive learning, trust regions, and hybrid GP refinement.

Result: CGP achieves controlled shrinkage of active sets and near-optimal sample complexity, outperforming baselines on benchmarks.

Conclusion: CGP provides principled stopping criteria and scalable solutions for noisy black-box optimization.

Abstract: We study black-box optimization of Lipschitz functions under noisy evaluations. Existing adaptive discretization methods implicitly avoid suboptimal regions but do not provide explicit certificates of optimality or measurable progress guarantees. We introduce \textbf{Certificate-Guided Pruning (CGP)}, which maintains an explicit \emph{active set} $A_t$ of potentially optimal points via confidence-adjusted Lipschitz envelopes. Any point outside $A_t$ is certifiably suboptimal with high probability, and under a margin condition with near-optimality dimension $α$, we prove $\Vol(A_t)$ shrinks at a controlled rate yielding sample complexity $\tildeO(\varepsilon^{-(2+α)})$. We develop three extensions: CGP-Adaptive learns $L$ online with $O(\log T)$ overhead; CGP-TR scales to $d > 50$ via trust regions with local certificates; and CGP-Hybrid switches to GP refinement when local smoothness is detected. Experiments on 12 benchmarks ($d \in [2, 100]$) show CGP variants match or exceed strong baselines while providing principled stopping criteria via certificate volume.

*Hari Krishna Sahoo,Mudit Gaur,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rectified flow models improve efficiency by enforcing linear transport trajectories, enabling fast sampling and achieving optimal sample complexity under standard assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance flow-based generative models by constraining transport trajectories to be linear, speeding up sampling while maintaining high-quality generation.

Method: The paper uses rectified flow models, which linearize paths from base to data distribution, and analyzes them theoretically under assumptions about neural network classes and velocity fields.

Result: Rectified flows achieve sample complexity O~(ε^-2), improving on prior O(ε^-4) bounds and matching the optimal rate for mean estimation.

Conclusion: The structural simplicity of rectified flows allows for controlled Rademacher complexity, explaining their strong empirical performance and efficiency gains.

Abstract: Recently, flow-based generative models have shown superior efficiency compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we study rectified flow models, which constrain transport trajectories to be linear from the base distribution to the data distribution. This structural restriction greatly accelerates sampling, often enabling high-quality generation with a single Euler step. Under standard assumptions on the neural network classes used to parameterize the velocity field and data distribution, we prove that rectified flows achieve sample complexity $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. This improves on the best known $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ bounds for flow matching model and matches the optimal rate for mean estimation. Our analysis exploits the particular structure of rectified flows: because the model is trained with a squared loss along linear paths, the associated hypothesis class admits a sharply controlled localized Rademacher complexity. This yields the improved, order-optimal sample complexity and provides a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of rectified flow models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWE-bench highlights LLMs' software engineering evaluation gaps, proposing HE-SNR for better mid-training guidance via entropy compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of effective metrics for guiding mid-training of LLMs, especially in complex software engineering tasks.

Method: Introduces a data filtering strategy and the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, leading to HE-SNR metric development.

Result: HE-SNR shows superior robustness and predictive power in industrial MoE models across varied contexts.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical and practical tools for optimizing LLMs' potential in engineering domains.

Abstract: SWE-bench has emerged as the premier benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on complex software engineering tasks. While these capabilities are fundamentally acquired during the mid-training phase and subsequently elicited during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), there remains a critical deficit in metrics capable of guiding mid-training effectively. Standard metrics such as Perplexity (PPL) are compromised by the "Long-Context Tax" and exhibit weak correlation with downstream SWE performance. In this paper, we bridge this gap by first introducing a rigorous data filtering strategy. Crucially, we propose the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, redefining intelligence not by scalar Top-1 compression, but by the capacity to structure uncertainty into Entropy-Compressed States of low orders ("reasonable hesitation"). Grounded in this fine-grained entropy analysis, we formulate a novel metric, HE-SNR (High-Entropy Signal-to-Noise Ratio). Validated on industrial-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models across varying context windows (32K/128K), our approach demonstrates superior robustness and predictive power. This work provides both the theoretical foundation and practical tools for optimizing the latent potential of LLMs in complex engineering domains.

TL;DR: C2 enhances Decision Transformer (DT) with cross-correlation modeling and selective learning for auto-bidding, achieving up to 3.23% performance gain over GAVE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address DT's limitations: insufficient cross-correlation modeling and indiscriminate learning of behaviors in auto-bidding.

Method: Introduces Cross Learning Block (CLB) for inter-sequence correlation and Constraint-aware Loss (CL) for optimal trajectory learning.

Result: Achieves up to 3.23% gain over GAVE on AuctionNet dataset; ablation studies confirm CLB and CL synergy.

Conclusion: C2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in auto-bidding by effectively addressing DT's limitations.

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT) shows promise for generative auto-bidding by capturing temporal dependencies, but suffers from two critical limitations: insufficient cross-correlation modeling among state, action, and return-to-go (RTG) sequences, and indiscriminate learning of optimal/suboptimal behaviors. To address these, we propose C2, a novel framework enhancing DT with two core innovations: (1) a Cross Learning Block (CLB) via cross-attention to strengthen inter-sequence correlation modeling; (2) a Constraint-aware Loss (CL) incorporating budget and Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) constraints for selective learning of optimal trajectories. Extensive offline evaluations on the AuctionNet dataset demonstrate consistent performance gains (up to 3.23\% over state-of-the-art GAVE) across diverse budget settings; ablation studies verify the complementary synergy of CLB and CL, confirming C2's superiority in auto-bidding.

*Long Van Tran,Truyen Tran,Phuoc Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework to recover temporal order in SDE parameter estimation, addressing issues like corrupted or hidden temporal data. It uses score-matching to infer order and tests the method on synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SDE parameter estimation methods fail when temporal ordering is corrupted or hidden, limiting their use in privacy-sensitive or incomplete data scenarios.

Method: The framework exploits asymmetries in forward/backward processes, uses score-matching for pairwise temporal order inference, and sorts observations for total order recovery before parameter estimation via maximum likelihood.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the method's effectiveness in estimating SDE parameters without relying on accurate temporal ordering.

Conclusion: The proposed framework broadens SDE parameter estimation to scenarios with missing or hidden temporal data, enhancing applicability in sensitive or incomplete-data domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have enabled robust modeling of real-world dynamical processes across diverse domains, such as finance, health, and systems biology. However, parameter estimation for SDEs typically relies on accurately timestamped observational sequences. When temporal ordering information is corrupted, missing, or deliberately hidden (e.g., for privacy), existing estimation methods often fail. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which temporal order can be recovered and introduce a novel framework that simultaneously reconstructs temporal information and estimates SDE parameters. Our approach exploits asymmetries between forward and backward processes, deriving a score-matching criterion to infer the correct temporal order between pairs of observations. We then recover the total order via a sorting procedure and estimate SDE parameters from the reconstructed sequence using maximum likelihood. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, extending parameter estimation to settings with missing temporal order and broadening applicability in sensitive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As forecasting models face diminishing returns in accuracy, the paper explores post-processing as an underexplored opportunity to bridge the last-mile gap in time-series forecasting.

Method: Delta-Adapter introduces tiny, bounded modules at input and output interfaces for soft edits and residual correction, ensuring local descent guarantees, drift bounds, and stability. It also acts as a feature selector and distribution calibrator.

Result: Experiments show Delta-Adapter improves accuracy and calibration across diverse backbones and datasets with negligible computational overhead and no interface changes.

Conclusion: Delta-Adapter effectively enhances deployed forecasters by addressing accuracy, interpretability, and uncertainty calibration through lightweight post-processing.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has long been dominated by advances in model architecture, with recent progress driven by deep learning and hybrid statistical techniques. However, as forecasting models approach diminishing returns in accuracy, a critical yet underexplored opportunity emerges: the strategic use of post-processing. In this paper, we address the last-mile gap in time-series forecasting, which is to improve accuracy and uncertainty without retraining or modifying a deployed backbone. We propose $δ$-Adapter, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic way to boost deployed time series forecasters without retraining. $δ$-Adapter learns tiny, bounded modules at two interfaces: input nudging (soft edits to covariates) and output residual correction. We provide local descent guarantees, $O(δ)$ drift bounds, and compositional stability for combined adapters. Meanwhile, it can act as a feature selector by learning a sparse, horizon-aware mask over inputs to select important features, thereby improving interpretability. In addition, it can also be used as a distribution calibrator to measure uncertainty. Thus, we introduce a Quantile Calibrator and a Conformal Corrector that together deliver calibrated, personalized intervals with finite-sample coverage. Our experiments across diverse backbones and datasets show that $δ$-Adapter improves accuracy and calibration with negligible compute and no interface changes.

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of attention layers in transformer-based LLMs, linking them to human memory retrieval mechanisms, and identifies neurons encoding context-defining keywords for applications like unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses gaps in understanding how attention layers in LLMs function, particularly their analogy to human memory processes, driven by regulatory pressures for transparency and accountability.

Method: The research draws on psychology and computational psycholinguistics, hypothesizing that attention layers mimic cue-based retrieval in human memory, with keywords acting as cues. Neurons encoding these keywords are isolated.

Result: Evidence supports the keywords-as-cues hypothesis, and neurons facilitating keyword retrieval are identified, enabling keyword extraction for downstream tasks like unlearning.

Conclusion: The study advances XAI by clarifying attention mechanisms in LLMs and offers practical insights for improving transparency and unlearning capabilities.

Abstract: While explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for large language models (LLMs) remains an evolving field with many unresolved questions, increasing regulatory pressures have spurred interest in its role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and privacy-preserving machine unlearning. Despite recent advances in XAI have provided some insights, the specific role of attention layers in transformer based LLMs remains underexplored. This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords. We provide converging evidence for this keywords-as-cues hypothesis. In addition, we isolate neurons within attention layers whose activations selectively encode and facilitate the retrieval of context-defining keywords. Consequently, these keywords can be extracted from identified neurons and further contribute to downstream applications such as unlearning.

TL;DR: A framework for learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging is introduced, improving resolution without high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and spatial resolution in PACT by compensating for SIR effects in the data domain.

Method: Developed two models (U-Net and Deconv-Net) to map SIR-corrupted data to idealized data, enabling efficient reconstruction.

Result: Validation showed improved resolution and robustness; in-vivo application revealed previously obscured structures.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances accuracy and speed in 3D PACT imaging.

Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.

Conclusion: Provides a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time control while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Bridging the sim2real gap between computationally inexpensive models and complex physical systems remains a central challenge in machine learning applications to engineering problems, particularly in multi-scale settings where reduced-order models typically capture only dominant dynamics. In this work, we present Cheap2Rich, a multi-scale data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor histories by combining a fast low-fidelity prior with learned, interpretable discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects. The results highlight a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation and system identification in complex multi-scale systems, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time monitoring and control while providing interpretable discrepancy dynamics.

TL;DR: Peer prediction method evaluates and post-trains LLMs without ground truth, rewarding honesty and resisting deception, even with weak supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluations rely on strong supervision, which is often unavailable, leading to deceptive results. Mechanism design research offers solutions for honest answers under weak supervision.

Method: Introduced peer prediction method based on mutual predictability, rewarding honest answers without needing ground truth labels.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness with theoretical and empirical validation, including recovering truthfulness in models post-malicious finetuning and reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision.

Conclusion: Peer prediction outperforms traditional LLM-as-a-Judge methods, especially with large capability gaps, enabling trustworthy evaluation and training under weak supervision.

Abstract: The evaluation and post-training of large language models (LLMs) rely on supervision, but strong supervision for difficult tasks is often unavailable, especially when evaluating frontier models. In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for GMV prediction with delayed feedback modeling, and proposes READER, a dual-branch predictor addressing repurchase and label calibration challenges, improving accuracy by 2.19%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unexplored challenge of delayed feedback modeling for continuous GMV prediction, where a single click can lead to multiple purchases.

Method: Establish TRACE benchmark and propose READER, a repurchase-aware dual-branch predictor with dynamic calibration for regression targets.

Result: READER achieves a 2.19% accuracy improvement on TRACE, demonstrating superior performance over baselines.

Conclusion: The study opens new research avenues for GMV delayed feedback modeling, with TRACE and READER providing valuable insights and tools for future work.

Abstract: The prediction objectives of online advertisement ranking models are evolving from probabilistic metrics like conversion rate (CVR) to numerical business metrics like post-click gross merchandise volume (GMV). Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router. Moreover, READER dynamically calibrates the regression target to mitigate under-estimation caused by incomplete labels. Experimental results show that READER yields superior performance on TRACE over baselines, achieving a 2.19% improvement in terms of accuracy. We believe that our study will open up a new avenue for studying online delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction, and our TRACE benchmark with the gathered insights will facilitate future research and application in this promising direction.

### [206] [Window-Diffusion: Accelerating Diffusion Language Model Inference with Windowed Token Pruning and Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20332)
*Fengrui Zuo,Zhiwei Ke,Yiming Liu,Wenqi Lou,Chao Wang,Xvehai Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A window-based method accelerates DLM inference by pruning and caching tokens, achieving significant speedup without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DLMs suffer from redundant computation due to full-sequence attention. Block-wise diffusion reduces cost but requires retraining. Token-level analysis shows locality in DLM inference, enabling optimization.

Method: Proposes a window-based token pruning and caching approach. Divides tokens into active, buffer (cached KV states), and far-field (pruned) tokens, restricting computation to the sliding window.

Result: Achieves up to 99× inference speedup on LLaDA and Dream datasets while maintaining generation performance.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces redundant computation in DLMs without retraining, leveraging structural locality and token partitioning.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate text through iterative denoising, but inference requires full-sequence attention at every iteration, resulting in substantial redundant computation on masked tokens. Block-wise diffusion can reduce this cost, yet it typically relies on retraining and constrained update orders, limiting its direct applicability to pretrained DLMs. Our token-level analysis reveals pronounced structural locality in DLM inference. Decoding is driven by a small set of prefix-localized active tokens; the influence of distant undecoded context diminishes rapidly, and decoded tokens exhibit stage-wise temporal stability, enabling reuse of intermediate representations except for a brief post-decode transient. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textbf{\placeholder}\footnote{The source code is available at https://github.com/vhicrgit/Window-Diffusion.}, a window-based token pruning and caching method for inference. We maintain a local computation window that slides rightward as denoising progresses, and partition undecoded tokens into: (i) \textit{active tokens} that are computed online, (ii) \textit{buffer tokens} whose KV states are cached and periodically refreshed, and (iii) \textit{far-field tokens} that are pruned outside the window. Computation is restricted to active and buffer tokens within the window, while far-field tokens are omitted at each stage. Experiments on LLaDA and Dream show that, under matched compute budgets, our method achieves up to $99\times$ inference speedup while largely preserving generation performance.

TL;DR: TABED dynamically ensembles multiple drafts using batch inference deviations, achieving 1.74x speedup over autoregressive decoding and 5% better than single drafting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SD methods are unexplored for LVLMs, which process both image and text prompts.

Method: Benchmarking existing methods and proposing TABED, a dynamic ensemble leveraging batch inference deviations.

Result: TABED achieves robust speedups and performance improvements.

Conclusion: TABED is a training-free, plug-and-play solution for LVLM acceleration.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has proven effective for accelerating LLM inference by quickly generating draft tokens and verifying them in parallel. However, SD remains largely unexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which extend LLMs to process both image and text prompts. To address this gap, we benchmark existing inference methods with small draft models on 11 datasets across diverse input scenarios and observe scenario-specific performance fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing. With its plug-and-play compatibility, we further enhance TABED by integrating advanced verification and alternative drafting methods. Code and custom-trained models are available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/TABED.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TINNs improve accuracy and convergence for solving time-dependent PDEs by evolving network weights over time, outperforming PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs reuse a single network across all times, degrading accuracy and training stability.

Method: TINNs parameterize network weights as a function of time, optimizing with Levenberg--Marquardt.

Result: Experiments show TINNs achieve up to 4× better accuracy and 10× faster convergence than PINNs.

Conclusion: TINNs offer a promising alternative to PINNs for solving time-dependent PDEs with evolving dynamics.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) solve time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning a mesh-free, differentiable solution that can be evaluated anywhere in space and time. However, standard space--time PINNs take time as an input but reuse a single network with shared weights across all times, forcing the same features to represent markedly different dynamics. This coupling degrades accuracy and can destabilize training when enforcing PDE, boundary, and initial constraints jointly. We propose Time-Induced Neural Networks (TINNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes the network weights as a learned function of time, allowing the effective spatial representation to evolve over time while maintaining shared structure. The resulting formulation naturally yields a nonlinear least-squares problem, which we optimize efficiently using a Levenberg--Marquardt method. Experiments on various time-dependent PDEs show up to $4\times$ improved accuracy and $10\times$ faster convergence compared to PINNs and strong baselines.

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether continuous-time generative models can represent highly sparse, constrained discrete distributions, using Sudoku grids as a test case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if standard continuous-time models can handle globally constrained discrete structures.

Method: Flow-matching and score-based models trained along Gaussian paths, comparing ODE, SDE, and DDPM-style sampling.

Result: Stochastic sampling outperforms deterministic flows; DDPM-style sampling achieves highest validity.

Conclusion: Classic diffusion/flow models can represent constrained combinatorial structures and assist in constraint satisfaction.

Abstract: Can standard continuous-time generative models represent distributions whose support is an extremely sparse, globally constrained discrete set? We study this question using completed Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, treating them as a subset of a continuous relaxation space. We train flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path and compare deterministic (ODE) sampling, stochastic (SDE) sampling, and DDPM-style discretizations derived from the same continuous-time training. Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.

TL;DR: LLM-AutoDP leverages LLMs to automate data processing strategies for domain-specific fine-tuning, reducing manual effort and privacy risks while improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data processing for fine-tuning LLMs is labor-intensive and raises privacy concerns, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.

Method: Proposes LLM-AutoDP, a framework using LLMs to generate and refine DP strategies iteratively with feedback, incorporating acceleration techniques like Distribution Preserving Sampling and Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism.

Result: Achieves over 80% win rate against unprocessed data and 65% against LLM-based AutoML baselines, with a 10x reduction in search time.

Conclusion: LLM-AutoDP effectively automates and optimizes data processing for LLM fine-tuning, balancing performance, privacy, and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments on multi-domain datasets show that FedRD outperforms competing baselines in addressing the challenges of HFL.

Conclusion: FedRD effectively tackles the critical issues in federated domain generalization, offering a robust solution for collaborative learning in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) aims to ensure effective and privacy-preserving collaboration among different entities. As newly joined clients require significant adjustments and additional training to align with the existing system, the problem of generalizing federated learning models to unseen clients under heterogeneous data has become progressively crucial. Consequently, we highlight two unsolved challenging issues in federated domain generalization: Optimization Divergence and Performance Divergence. To tackle the above challenges, we propose FedRD, a novel heterogeneity-aware federated learning algorithm that collaboratively utilizes parameter-guided global generalization aggregation and local debiased classification to reduce divergences, aiming to obtain an optimal global model for participating and unseen clients. Extensive experiments on public multi-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach exhibits a substantial performance advantage over competing baselines in addressing this specific problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new memorization detection metric for diffusion-based image generative models by combining isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current memorization detection methods in diffusion models, which rely on isotropic assumptions and are ineffective in anisotropic regimes.

Method: Develops a detection metric by analyzing isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment of guidance and unconditional scores, computable via two forward passes on pure noise inputs.

Result: Outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods, being 5x faster, and demonstrates effectiveness through a mitigation strategy for memorized prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed metric offers a faster and more accurate solution for detecting memorization in diffusion models, with practical applications in mitigating memorization.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generative models produce high-fidelity images through iterative denoising but remain vulnerable to memorization, where they unintentionally reproduce exact copies or parts of training images. Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by utilizing a mitigation strategy that adapts memorized prompts based on our developed metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical grounding for extracting human-interpretable concepts from LLM representations, addressing the ambiguity and methodological challenges faced by SAEs.

Method: Proposes ConCA, an unsupervised linear unmixing process to recover log-posteriors of concepts from LLM representations, with sparse ConCA leveraging sparsity for better performance.

Result: Implemented 12 sparse ConCA variants, showing their effectiveness in extracting meaningful concepts across multiple LLMs, outperforming SAEs.

Conclusion: ConCA offers a theory-backed alternative to SAEs for concept extraction, demonstrating practical advantages and clearer theoretical foundations.

Abstract: Developing human understandable interpretation of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly critical for their deployment in essential domains. Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem. We implement 12 sparse ConCA variants and demonstrate their ability to extract meaningful concepts across multiple LLMs, offering theory-backed advantages over SAEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents trained on static environments lose performance as digital environments change over time due to shifts in domains and resolutions. Existing methods fail to adapt to these changes effectively.

Method: The authors introduce GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), a reinforcement fine-tuning framework with two novel rewards: Anchoring Point Reward in Flux (APR-iF) and Anchoring Region Reward in Flux (ARR-iF). These rewards help agents adapt to shifting interaction points and regions.

Result: GUI-AiF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in experiments, demonstrating improved stability and adaptability in continual learning scenarios for GUI agents.

Conclusion: The work presents the first continual learning framework for GUI agents, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement fine-tuning with novel rewards in adapting to dynamic digital environments.

Abstract: As digital environments (data distribution) are in flux, with new GUI data arriving over time-introducing new domains or resolutions-agents trained on static environments deteriorate in performance. In this work, we introduce Continual GUI Agents, a new task that requires GUI agents to perform continual learning under shifted domains and resolutions. We find existing methods fail to maintain stable grounding as GUI distributions shift over time, due to the diversity of UI interaction points and regions in fluxing scenarios. To address this, we introduce GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework that stabilizes continual learning through two novel rewards: Anchoring Point Reward in Flux (APR-iF) and Anchoring Region Reward in Flux (ARR-iF). These rewards guide the agents to align with shifting interaction points and regions, mitigating the tendency of existing reward strategies to over-adapt to static grounding cues (e.g., fixed coordinates or element scales). Extensive experiments show GUI-AiF surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. Our work establishes the first continual learning framework for GUI agents, revealing the untapped potential of reinforcement fine-tuning for continual GUI Agents.

TL;DR: TimeCatcher is a volatility-aware variational forecasting framework that improves long-term forecasting for non-stationary time series by capturing dynamic patterns and amplifying significant variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight MLP-based models assume local stationarity and struggle with highly non-stationary series, especially during abrupt fluctuations, common in domains like web traffic monitoring.

Method: TimeCatcher extends linear architectures with a variational encoder to capture latent dynamic patterns and a volatility-aware mechanism to detect and amplify significant local variations.

Result: Experiments on nine real-world datasets (traffic, financial, energy, weather) show TimeCatcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, especially in high-volatility, long-term forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: TimeCatcher addresses limitations of current models in handling non-stationary series, achieving robust performance in volatile, long-term forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Recent lightweight MLP-based models have achieved strong performance in time series forecasting by capturing stable trends and seasonal patterns. However, their effectiveness hinges on an implicit assumption of local stationarity assumption, making them prone to errors in long-term forecasting of highly non-stationary series, especially when abrupt fluctuations occur, a common challenge in domains like web traffic monitoring. To overcome this limitation, we propose TimeCatcher, a novel Volatility-Aware Variational Forecasting framework. TimeCatcher extends linear architectures with a variational encoder to capture latent dynamic patterns hidden in historical data and a volatility-aware enhancement mechanism to detect and amplify significant local variations. Experiments on nine real-world datasets from traffic, financial, energy, and weather domains show that TimeCatcher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with particularly large improvements in long-term forecasting scenarios characterized by high volatility and sudden fluctuations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing transparency and fairness in ML models by ensuring equitable recourse options for individuals and protected groups.

Method: Defines fairness at individual, group, and hybrid levels; formulates an optimization task and uses reinforcement learning to generate fair CFs.

Result: Effective fairness preservation across benchmarks, with maintained CF quality (proximity, plausibility) and quantified fairness costs.

Conclusion: Highlights hybrid fairness's importance in XAI, paving the way for broader discussions beyond CFs.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is becoming increasingly essential for enhancing the transparency of machine learning (ML) models. Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs.

We model classification as a set of binary tests between class-conditional distributions of representations and empirically show that, along training trajectories, well-generalizing networks increasingly align with Neyman-Pearson optimal decision rules via monotonic improvements in KL divergence that relate to error rate exponents. We finally discuss how this yields an explanation and possible training or regularization strategies for different classes of neural networks.

TL;DR: A semi-supervised VAE framework aligns latent variables with dementia biomarkers, validated using ADNI PET scans to reveal disease-related metabolic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in analyzing high-dimensional neuroimaging data for neurodegenerative diseases by capturing disease-relevant features in a lower-dimensional space.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised VAE with similarity regularization to align latent variables with clinical measures, applied to ADNI PET scans.

Result: Guided latent variables align with cognitive scores, revealing metabolic reductions in key brain regions and networks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively extracts interpretable disease-related patterns, adaptable for studying neurodegenerative progression.

Abstract: High-dimensional neuroimaging data presents challenges for assessing neurodegenerative diseases due to complex non-linear relationships. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can encode scans into lower-dimensional latent spaces capturing disease-relevant features. We propose a semi-supervised VAE framework with a flexible similarity regularization term that aligns selected latent variables with clinical or biomarker measures of dementia progression. This allows adapting the similarity metric and supervised variables to specific goals or available data. We demonstrate the approach using PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), guiding the first latent dimension to align with a cognitive score. Using this supervised latent variable, we generate average reconstructions across levels of cognitive impairment. Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks. The remaining latent variables encode affine transformations and intensity variations, capturing confounds such as inter-subject variability and site effects. Our framework effectively extracts disease-related patterns aligned with established Alzheimer's biomarkers, offering an interpretable and adaptable tool for studying neurodegenerative progression.

TL;DR: CCMamba introduces a mamba-based neural framework for learning on combinatorial complexes, enabling efficient, adaptive, and scalable higher-order relational modeling without self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topological deep learning methods suffer from quadratic complexity and limited scalability due to reliance on local message passing via attention mechanisms.

Method: CCMamba reformulates message passing as selective state-space modeling, organizing multi-rank incidence relations into sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models.

Result: CCMamba demonstrates superior performance on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks, with improved scalability and robustness to depth.

Conclusion: CCMamba offers a linear-time, rank-aware solution for topological deep learning, surpassing traditional methods in expressive power and efficiency.

Abstract: Topological deep learning has emerged for modeling higher-order relational structures beyond pairwise interactions that standard graph neural networks fail to capture. Although combinatorial complexes offer a unified topological framework, most existing topological deep learning methods rely on local message passing via attention mechanisms, which incur quadratic complexity and remain low-dimensional, limiting scalability and rank-aware information aggregation in higher-order complexes.We propose Combinatorial Complex Mamba (CCMamba), the first unified mamba-based neural framework for learning on combinatorial complexes. CCMamba reformulates message passing as a selective state-space modeling problem by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models. This enables adaptive, directional, and long range information propagation in linear time without self attention. We further establish the theoretical analysis that the expressive power upper-bound of CCMamba message passing is the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Experiments on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks demonstrate that CCMamba consistently outperforms existing methods while exhibiting improved scalability and robustness to depth.

Abstract: Unsupervised ensemble learning emerged to address the challenge of combining multiple learners' predictions without access to ground truth labels or additional data.

*Efstratios Zaradoukas,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PURGE introduces a novel method for unlearning sensitive data in LLMs, improving efficiency, fluency, and robustness compared to existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs memorize sensitive data during pretraining, raising compliance issues. Existing unlearning methods leak data, reduce fluency, or rely on costly external models.

Method: PURGE uses an intrinsic reward signal to penalize forbidden concepts, framed as a verifiable unlearning task under Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: PURGE reduces token usage by 46x, improves fluency by 5.48%, and boosts robustness by 12.02%. It achieves 11% unlearning effectiveness while retaining 98% utility.

Conclusion: Framing unlearning as a verifiable task enables reliable, efficient forgetting, offering a promising direction for compliance-ready LLM deployment.

Abstract: During pretraining, LLMs inadvertently memorize sensitive or copyrighted data, posing significant compliance challenges under legal frameworks like the GDPR and the EU AI Act. Fulfilling these mandates demands techniques that can remove information from a deployed model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning approaches attempt to address this need, but often leak the very data they aim to erase, sacrifice fluency and robustness, or depend on costly external reward models. We introduce PURGE (Policy Unlearning through Relative Group Erasure), a novel method grounded in the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework that formulates unlearning as a verifiable problem. PURGE uses an intrinsic reward signal that penalizes any mention of forbidden concepts, allowing safe and consistent unlearning. Our approach reduces token usage per target by up to a factor of 46 compared with SotA methods, while improving fluency by 5.48 percent and adversarial robustness by 12.02 percent over the base model. On the Real World Knowledge Unlearning (RWKU) benchmark, PURGE achieves 11 percent unlearning effectiveness while preserving 98 percent of original utility. PURGE shows that framing LLM unlearning as a verifiable task, enables more reliable, efficient, and scalable forgetting, suggesting a promising new direction for unlearning research that combines theoretical guarantees, improved safety, and practical deployment efficiency.

Motivation: To address the need for decentralized learning algorithms on edge devices that are communication-efficient, robust to data corruption, and memory-light, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Method: Introduces AsylADMM, a gossip algorithm requiring only two variables per node, analyzed theoretically and empirically for synchronous and asynchronous cases.

Result: Demonstrates fast convergence, enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, outperforming rank-based methods.

Conclusion: AsylADMM offers a practical solution for robust decentralized learning on resource-constrained devices, supported by novel theoretical insights.

Abstract: Specifications for decentralized learning on resource-constrained edge devices require algorithms that are communication-efficient, robust to data corruption, and lightweight in memory usage. While state-of-the-art gossip-based methods satisfy the first requirement, achieving robustness remains challenging. Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods. Finally, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of rank-based trimming via Markov chain theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in ordinal regression and ranking caused by inherent dependencies conventional methods fail to model.

Method: Proposes RARL with a unified objective integrating regression and L2R, featuring ranking-aware rewards and RMO for training stability.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through extensive experiments on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: RARL successfully models ordinal dependencies and improves performance jointly for regression and ranking tasks.

Abstract: Ordinal regression and ranking are challenging due to inherent ordinal dependencies that conventional methods struggle to model. We propose Ranking-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a novel RL framework that explicitly learns these relationships. At its core, RARL features a unified objective that synergistically integrates regression and Learning-to-Rank (L2R), enabling mutual improvement between the two tasks. This is driven by a ranking-aware verifiable reward that jointly assesses regression precision and ranking accuracy, facilitating direct model updates via policy optimization. To further enhance training, we introduce Response Mutation Operations (RMO), which inject controlled noise to improve exploration and prevent stagnation at saddle points. The effectiveness of RARL is validated through extensive experiments on three distinct benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-GTD, a regularized version of GTD learning algorithms, addressing instability caused by singular feature interaction matrices in off-policy policy evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GTD algorithms assume nonsingular feature interaction matrices (FIM), which can fail in practice, leading to instability. The paper aims to solve this by regularization.

Method: The authors reformulate the MSPBE minimization into a regularized optimization objective, yielding the R-GTD algorithm, which ensures stability even with singular FIM.

Result: Theoretical guarantees and error bounds for R-GTD are established, and empirical experiments confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: R-GTD provides a stable and convergent solution for off-policy policy evaluation even when the FIM is singular.

Abstract: Gradient temporal-difference (GTD) learning algorithms are widely used for off-policy policy evaluation with function approximation. However, existing convergence analyses rely on the restrictive assumption that the so-called feature interaction matrix (FIM) is nonsingular. In practice, the FIM can become singular and leads to instability or degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a regularized optimization objective by reformulating the mean-square projected Bellman error (MSPBE) minimization. This formulation naturally yields a regularized GTD algorithms, referred to as R-GTD, which guarantees convergence to a unique solution even when the FIM is singular. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and explicit error bounds for the proposed method, and validate its effectiveness through empirical experiments.

Result: CoBA achieves superior accuracy compared to conventional ML models and fingerprinting benchmarks, validated with a dedicated dataset from TalTech's 5G mmWave network.

Conclusion: CoBA demonstrates reliable potential for regulated UAV airspace monitoring, offering a robust solution for classification challenges in low-altitude operations.

Abstract: Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in civilian and industrial applications, making secure low-altitude operations crucial. In dense mmWave environments, accurately classifying low-altitude UAVs as either inside authorized or restricted airspaces remains challenging, requiring models that handle complex propagation and signal variability. This paper proposes a deep learning model, referred to as CoBA, which stands for integrated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Attention which leverages Fifth Generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio measurements to classify UAV operations in authorized and restricted airspaces at low altitude. The proposed CoBA model integrates convolutional, bidirectional recurrent, and attention layers to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in UAV radio measurements. To validate the model, a dedicated dataset is collected using the 5G mmWave network at TalTech, with controlled low altitude UAV flights in authorized and restricted scenarios. The model is evaluated against conventional ML models and a fingerprinting-based benchmark. Experimental results show that CoBA achieves superior accuracy, significantly outperforming all baseline models and demonstrating its potential for reliable and regulated UAV airspace monitoring.

Result: Achieves significantly faster inference than baselines while maintaining accuracy, and efficiently predicts perturbation responses.

Conclusion: WFR-MFM offers scalable, efficient solutions for dynamical system reconstruction in single-cell studies.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamical evolution from limited observations is a fundamental challenge in single-cell biology, where dynamic unbalanced optimal transport provides a principled framework for modeling coupled transport and mass variation. However, existing approaches rely on trajectory simulation at inference time, making inference a key bottleneck for scalable applications. In this work, we propose a mean-flow framework for unbalanced flow matching that summarizes both transport and mass-growth dynamics over arbitrary time intervals using mean velocity and mass-growth fields, enabling fast one-step generation without trajectory simulation. To solve dynamic unbalanced optimal transport under the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry, we further build on this framework to develop Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Mean Flow Matching (WFR-MFM). Across synthetic and real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, WFR-MFM achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference than a range of existing baselines while maintaining high predictive accuracy, and enables efficient perturbation response prediction on large synthetic datasets with thousands of conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in time series forecasting by introducing ACFormer, a model combining linear efficiency with CNN's non-linear feature extraction for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of linear models in capturing non-linear signals and complex dependencies in time series forecasting.

Method: Proposes ACFormer, which uses convolutional layers for feature extraction, a shared compression module for fine-grained information, gated attention for temporal locality, and patch expansion for variable-specific patterns.

Result: ACFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, effectively capturing high-frequency components.

Conclusion: ACFormer successfully reconciles linear efficiency with non-linear feature extraction, outperforming existing models in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) faces challenges in modeling complex intra-channel temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations. Although recent research has highlighted the efficiency of linear architectures in capturing global trends, these models often struggle with non-linear signals. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic receptive field analysis of convolutional neural network (CNN) TSF models. We introduce the "individual receptive field" to uncover granular structural dependencies, revealing that convolutional layers act as feature extractors that mirror channel-wise attention while exhibiting superior robustness to non-linear fluctuations. Based on these insights, we propose ACFormer, an architecture designed to reconcile the efficiency of linear projections with the non-linear feature-extraction power of convolutions. ACFormer captures fine-grained information through a shared compression module, preserves temporal locality via gated attention, and reconstructs variable-specific temporal patterns using an independent patch expansion layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACFormer consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating the inherent drawbacks of linear models in capturing high-frequency components.

Abstract: We propose DIVERSE, a framework for systematically exploring the Rashomon set of deep neural networks, the collection of models that match a reference model's accuracy while differing in their predictive behavior. DIVERSE augments a pretrained model with Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers and uses Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to search a latent modulation space, generating diverse model variants without retraining or gradient access. Across MNIST, PneumoniaMNIST, and CIFAR-10, DIVERSE uncovers multiple high-performing yet functionally distinct models. Our experiments show that DIVERSE offers a competitive and efficient exploration of the Rashomon set, making it feasible to construct diverse sets that maintain robustness and performance while supporting well-balanced model multiplicity. While retraining remains the baseline to generate Rashomon sets, DIVERSE achieves comparable diversity at reduced computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual sensor approaches lack generalizability, computational efficiency, and scalability, while current time series foundation models are incompatible with virtual sensors.

Method: The proposed foundation model learns relevant input signals for each virtual sensor, leverages task synergies, and maintains computational efficiency.

Result: The model achieved a 415x reduction in computation time, 951x reduction in memory requirements, and improved predictive quality in large-scale evaluations.

Conclusion: The introduced foundation model enables practical deployment in large-scale sensor networks by scaling gracefully to hundreds of virtual sensors with minimal parameter growth.

Abstract: Virtual sensors use machine learning to predict target signals from available measurements, replacing expensive physical sensors in critical applications. Existing virtual sensor approaches require application-specific models with hand-selected inputs for each sensor, cannot leverage task synergies, and lack consistent benchmarks. At the same time, emerging time series foundation models are computationally expensive and limited to predicting their input signals, making them incompatible with virtual sensors. We introduce the first foundation model for virtual sensors addressing both limitations. Our unified model can simultaneously predict diverse virtual sensors exploiting synergies while maintaining computational efficiency. It learns relevant input signals for each virtual sensor, eliminating expert knowledge requirements while adding explainability. In our large-scale evaluation on a standard benchmark and an application-specific dataset with over 18 billion samples, our architecture achieves 415x reduction in computation time and 951x reduction in memory requirements, while maintaining or even improving predictive quality compared to baselines. Our model scales gracefully to hundreds of virtual sensors with nearly constant parameter count, enabling practical deployment in large-scale sensor networks.

TL;DR: The study explores Neural ODEs (NODEs) and Symbolic Regression (SR) for modeling complex systems. NODEs extrapolate well with dynamic similarity, SR recovers equations from noisy data with correct inputs, and combining NODEs with SR shows promise for inferring physical laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate scientific discovery by accurately modeling dynamics and discovering governing equations of complex systems using synthetic data.

Method: Used noisy synthetic data from damped oscillatory systems, tested NODEs for extrapolation and SR for equation recovery, and combined NODEs with SR.

Result: NODEs extrapolate effectively with dynamic similarity; SR recovers equations from noisy data with correct inputs. SR recovers two equations and approximates the third using NODE-generated data.

Conclusion: Combining NODEs and SR offers a promising approach for enriching limited data and inferring physical laws, though further work is needed.

Abstract: Accurately modelling the dynamics of complex systems and discovering their governing differential equations are critical tasks for accelerating scientific discovery. Using noisy, synthetic data from two damped oscillatory systems, we explore the extrapolation capabilities of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the ability of Symbolic Regression (SR) to recover the underlying equations. Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation. While this last finding highlights an area for future work, our results suggest that using NODEs to enrich limited data and enable symbolic regression to infer physical laws represents a promising new approach for scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework for learning context-aware runtime monitors for AI-based control ensembles improves safety and performance by selecting the best-suited controller for current conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML controllers in cyber-physical systems face accuracy degradation in unfamiliar environments, raising safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods often dilute individual controller strengths.

Method: The paper reformulates safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem, using contextual multi-armed bandits to learn and select the best controller for current conditions.

Result: The framework provides theoretical safety guarantees and better utilization of controller diversity, validated in simulated autonomous driving scenarios with improved safety and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed context-aware monitoring framework outperforms non-contextual baselines, leveraging controller strengths for safer and more efficient AI-based control ensembles.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning context-aware runtime monitors for AI-based control ensembles. Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.

Result: Experiments show MuRAL-CPD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially when minimal supervision is available, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed MuRAL-CPD method successfully addresses the limitations of traditional CPD by combining multiresolution analysis with active learning, leading to better performance and user alignment.

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) is a critical task in time series analysis, aiming to identify moments when the underlying data-generating process shifts. Traditional CPD methods often rely on unsupervised techniques, which lack adaptability to task-specific definitions of change and cannot benefit from user knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose MuRAL-CPD, a novel semi-supervised method that integrates active learning into a multiresolution CPD algorithm. MuRAL-CPD leverages a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition to detect changes across multiple temporal scales and incorporates user feedback to iteratively optimize key hyperparameters. This interaction enables the model to align its notion of change with that of the user, improving both accuracy and interpretability. Our experimental results on several real-world datasets show the effectiveness of MuRAL-CPD against state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios where minimal supervision is available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a PU RL distillation method for on-premise small models, eliminating the need for human preference annotation or reward models by using anchor-conditioned self-ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap in RL alignment for on-premise small models, which typically lack access to expensive human preference data or large-scale reward models.

Method: Uses positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation, querying a teacher model for an anchor response, sampling student candidates, and performing self-ranking to induce preferences for local training.

Result: The method achieves strong performance in low-cost settings, with theoretical support for its stability and order-consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables effective RL alignment for on-premise small models without costly external dependencies.

Abstract: Due to constraints on privacy, cost, and latency, on-premise deployment of small models is increasingly common. However, most practical pipelines stop at supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and fail to reach the reinforcement learning (RL) alignment stage. The main reason is that RL alignment typically requires either expensive human preference annotation or heavy reliance on high-quality reward models with large-scale API usage and ongoing engineering maintenance, both of which are ill-suited to on-premise settings. To bridge this gap, we propose a positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation method for on-premise small-model deployment. Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistently strong performance under a low-cost setting.

Motivation: Existing methods for group counterfactual explanations are limited by poor generalization, strict model assumptions, and uncontrolled geometry distortion. This paper aims to overcome these issues.

Method: The authors propose learning an explicit optimal transport map to transform any group instance into its counterfactual without re-optimization, minimizing transport cost and preserving group geometry.

Result: Experiments show the method generalizes accurately, preserves group geometry, and incurs negligible additional transport cost compared to baselines, especially outperforming them when model linearity isn't exploitable.

Conclusion: The proposed optimal transport map effectively addresses key limitations of existing methods, offering generalization, interpretability, and controlled geometry distortion.

Abstract: Group counterfactual explanations find a set of counterfactual instances to explain a group of input instances contrastively. However, existing methods either (i) optimize counterfactuals only for a fixed group and do not generalize to new group members, (ii) strictly rely on strong model assumptions (e.g., linearity) for tractability or/and (iii) poorly control the counterfactual group geometry distortion. We instead learn an explicit optimal transport map that sends any group instance to its counterfactual without re-optimization, minimizing the group's total transport cost. This enables generalization with fewer parameters, making it easier to interpret the common actionable recourse. For linear classifiers, we prove that functions representing group counterfactuals are derived via mathematical optimization, identifying the underlying convex optimization type (QP, QCQP, ...). Experiments show that they accurately generalize, preserve group geometry and incur only negligible additional transport cost compared to baseline methods. If model linearity cannot be exploited, our approach also significantly outperforms the baselines.

### [238] [Is Pure Exploitation Sufficient in Exogenous MDPs with Linear Function Approximation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20694)
*Hao Liang,Jiayu Cheng,Sean R. Sinclair,Yali Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pure Exploitation Learning (PEL) achieves strong regret bounds in Exo-MDPs without exploration, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap between empirical success of greedy methods in Exo-MDPs and lack of theoretical support.

Method: Introduces PEL and LSVI-PE, a linear-approximation method, using counterfactual trajectories and Bellman-closed feature transport.

Result: PEL achieves $Ã(H^2|Î|â‚ŽK)$ regret in tabular cases; LSVI-PE scales polynomially with feature dimension.

Conclusion: Pure exploitation suffices in Exo-MDPs, overturning the belief that exploration is necessary.

Abstract: Exogenous MDPs (Exo-MDPs) capture sequential decision-making where uncertainty comes solely from exogenous inputs that evolve independently of the learner's actions. This structure is especially common in operations research applications such as inventory control, energy storage, and resource allocation, where exogenous randomness (e.g., demand, arrivals, or prices) drives system behavior. Despite decades of empirical evidence that greedy, exploitation-only methods work remarkably well in these settings, theory has lagged behind: all existing regret guarantees for Exo-MDPs rely on explicit exploration or tabular assumptions. We show that exploration is unnecessary. We propose Pure Exploitation Learning (PEL) and prove the first general finite-sample regret bounds for exploitation-only algorithms in Exo-MDPs. In the tabular case, PEL achieves $\widetilde{O}(H^2|Ξ|\sqrt{K})$. For large, continuous endogenous state spaces, we introduce LSVI-PE, a simple linear-approximation method whose regret is polynomial in the feature dimension, exogenous state space, and horizon, independent of the endogenous state and action spaces. Our analysis introduces two new tools: counterfactual trajectories and Bellman-closed feature transport, which together allow greedy policies to have accurate value estimates without optimism. Experiments on synthetic and resource-management tasks show that PEL consistently outperforming baselines. Overall, our results overturn the conventional wisdom that exploration is required, demonstrating that in Exo-MDPs, pure exploitation is enough.

*Melika Mobini,Vincent Holst,Floriano Tori,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-generated bibliographies mimic human citation structure closely but leave semantic fingerprints detectable via embeddings, not graph structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLM-generated reference lists can be distinguished from human ones and understand the differences.

Method: Paired citation graphs (human and GPT-4o-generated) were analyzed using structural features and embeddings, tested with RF and GNNs.

Result: Embeddings sharply increased separability (93% accuracy), while structure alone was less effective (~60%). Results were replicated with Claude Sonnet 4.5.

Conclusion: LLM bibliographies mimic human topology but have detectable semantic traces; detection should focus on content, not graph structure.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to curate bibliographies, raising the question: are their reference lists distinguishable from human ones? We build paired citation graphs, ground truth and GPT-4o-generated (from parametric knowledge), for 10,000 focal papers ($\approx$ 275k references) from SciSciNet, and added a field-matched random baseline that preserves out-degree and field distributions while breaking latent structure. We compare (i) structure-only node features (degree/closeness/eigenvector centrality, clustering, edge count) with (ii) 3072-D title/abstract embeddings, using an RF on graph-level aggregates and Graph Neural Networks with node features. Structure alone barely separates GPT from ground truth (RF accuracy $\approx$ 0.60) despite cleanly rejecting the random baseline ($\approx$ 0.89--0.92). By contrast, embeddings sharply increase separability: RF on aggregated embeddings reaches $\approx$ 0.83, and GNNs with embedding node features achieve 93\% test accuracy on GPT vs.\ ground truth. We show the robustness of our findings by replicating the pipeline with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and with multiple embedding models (OpenAI and SPECTER), with RF separability for ground truth vs.\ Claude $\approx 0.77$ and clean rejection of the random baseline. Thus, LLM bibliographies, generated purely from parametric knowledge, closely mimic human citation topology, but leave detectable semantic fingerprints; detection and debiasing should target content signals rather than global graph structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Failure-prefix conditioning improves RLVR training by exposing models to failure-prone states, enhancing performance without losing token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training stalls in RLVR as problems become saturated due to rare encounters with informative failures.

Method: Failure-prefix conditioning reallocates exploration by training on prefixes from incorrect reasoning trajectories.

Result: The method matches gains from medium-difficulty problems, improves robustness, and unlocks further gains with iterative refreshes.

Conclusion: Failure-prefix conditioning effectively extends RLVR training on saturated problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.

TL;DR: MORPHIN is a self-adaptive Q-learning framework for RL agents facing non-stationary environments, offering dynamic adaptation without full retraining and outperforming standard Q-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL agents struggle in non-stationary environments with shifting rewards or expanding action spaces, necessitating adaptable frameworks.

Method: MORPHIN integrates concept drift detection and dynamic hyperparameter adjustments to adapt to reward shifts and action space expansions while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Result: MORPHIN achieves 1.7x better learning efficiency and superior convergence speed compared to standard Q-learning in Gridworld and traffic signal control simulations.

Conclusion: MORPHIN effectively enables RL agents to adapt dynamically in non-stationary environments, improving performance without full retraining.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in real-world applications where environmental conditions are non-stationary, particularly when reward functions shift or the available action space expands. This paper introduces MORPHIN, a self-adaptive Q-learning framework that enables on-the-fly adaptation without full retraining. By integrating concept drift detection with dynamic adjustments to learning and exploration hyperparameters, MORPHIN adapts agents to changes in both the reward function and on-the-fly expansions of the agent's action space, while preserving prior policy knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our approach using a Gridworld benchmark and a traffic signal control simulation. The results demonstrate that MORPHIN achieves superior convergence speed and continuous adaptation compared to a standard Q-learning baseline, improving learning efficiency by up to 1.7x.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reward models (RMs) inherit value biases from their base LLMs, impacting alignment with human preferences, as shown by consistent agency/communion differences in Llama and Gemma RMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reward models (RMs) derived from large language models (LLMs) inherit and exhibit biases in alignment with human values, which is understudied despite its importance.

Method: Analyzed 10 open-weight RMs using psycholinguistic corpora, focusing on 'Big Two' psychological axes (agency/communion). Examined log-probability differences and conducted ablation experiments.

Result: RMs show consistent value biases (e.g., Llama prefers agency, Gemma prefers communion) even with identical preference data and finetuning, traced back to base model logits.

Conclusion: RMs are strongly influenced by their base LLMs' pretraining, highlighting the need for alignment efforts at the pretraining stage and careful base model selection.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values but have received less attention than pre-trained and post-trained LLMs themselves. Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the "Big Two" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for "agency" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for "communion." This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.

*Anchen Sun,Zhibin Chen,Xiaodong Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Cox-MT model, a deep semi-supervised learning approach based on the Mean Teacher framework, improves survival prediction accuracy by utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data, outperforming existing ANN-based Cox models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled data restricts the performance of ANN-based Cox models in survival analysis.

Method: Employed a deep semi-supervised learning approach (Mean Teacher framework) to train single- and multi-modal ANN-based Cox models using labeled and unlabeled data.

Result: Cox-MT outperformed Cox-nnet in predicting cancer prognosis using TCGA data, with performance improving as unlabeled data increased. Multi-modal Cox-MT surpassed single-modal performance.

Conclusion: Cox-MT effectively leverages unlabeled data to enhance prediction accuracy, addressing limitations of traditional ANN-based Cox models.

Abstract: The Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model is widely used in survival analysis. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN)-based Cox-PH models have been developed. However, training these Cox models with high-dimensional features typically requires a substantial number of labeled samples containing information about time-to-event. The limited availability of labeled data for training often constrains the performance of ANN-based Cox models. To address this issue, we employed a deep semi-supervised learning (DSSL) approach to develop single- and multi-modal ANN-based Cox models based on the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data for training. We applied our model, named Cox-MT, to predict the prognosis of several types of cancer using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our single-modal Cox-MT models, utilizing TCGA RNA-seq data or whole slide images, significantly outperformed the existing ANN-based Cox model, Cox-nnet, using the same data set across four types of cancer considered. As the number of unlabeled samples increased, the performance of Cox-MT significantly improved with a given set of labeled data. Furthermore, our multi-modal Cox-MT model demonstrated considerably better performance than the single-modal model. In summary, the Cox-MT model effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to significantly enhance prediction accuracy compared to existing ANN-based Cox models trained solely on labeled data.

*Immanuel Abdi,Akshat Gupta,Micah Mok,Alexander Lu,Nicholas Lee,Gopala Anumanchipalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Evolutionary Strategies (ES) as a gradient-free alternative for continual learning in LLMs, comparing its performance and forgetting behavior with GRPO. While ES performs well initially, it suffers from significant forgetting due to less sparse updates with larger norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems struggle with continual learning post-deployment, partly due to memory-intensive gradient-based methods. ES offers a gradient-free alternative but lacks understanding of its forgetting behavior, which is crucial for continual learning applications.

Method: The study conducts a comprehensive analysis of ES, evaluating its forgetting curves during training across multiple update steps and comparing its performance and update characteristics with GRPO.

Result: ES achieves performance close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks but exhibits significant forgetting of prior abilities due to less sparse updates with larger norms.

Conclusion: The findings highlight ES's limitations for continual learning due to forgetting and call for future work to address this issue in gradient-free algorithms.

Abstract: One of the biggest missing capabilities in current AI systems is the ability to learn continuously after deployment. Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.

*Dawit Kiros Redie,Reza Arablouei,Stefan Werner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SA-PEF improves federated learning efficiency by combining step-ahead correction with partial error feedback, achieving faster convergence under non-IID data compared to traditional EF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address slow residual error decay and gradient mismatch in federated learning under non-IID data, which stalls early progress.

Method: Integrates step-ahead (SA) correction with partial error feedback (PEF), recovering EF when α=0 and SAEF when α=1. Analyzes convergence using second-moment bounds and residual recursion.

Result: Achieves O((η,η_0TR)−1) convergence to a variance/heterogeneity floor, matching Fed-SGD guarantees. Experiments confirm faster accuracy attainment than EF.

Conclusion: SA-PEF balances rapid warm-up and long-term stability, outperforming EF in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Biased gradient compression with error feedback (EF) reduces communication in federated learning (FL), but under non-IID data, the residual error can decay slowly, causing gradient mismatch and stalled progress in the early rounds. We propose step-ahead partial error feedback (SA-PEF), which integrates step-ahead (SA) correction with partial error feedback (PEF). SA-PEF recovers EF when the step-ahead coefficient $α=0$ and step-ahead EF (SAEF) when $α=1$. For non-convex objectives and $δ$-contractive compressors, we establish a second-moment bound and a residual recursion that guarantee convergence to stationarity under heterogeneous data and partial client participation. The resulting rates match standard non-convex Fed-SGD guarantees up to constant factors, achieving $O((η,η_0TR)^{-1})$ convergence to a variance/heterogeneity floor with a fixed inner step size. Our analysis reveals a step-ahead-controlled residual contraction $ρ_r$ that explains the observed acceleration in the early training phase. To balance SAEF's rapid warm-up with EF's long-term stability, we select $α$ near its theory-predicted optimum. Experiments across diverse architectures and datasets show that SA-PEF consistently reaches target accuracy faster than EF.

*Guoan Wang,Feiyu Wang,Zongwei Lv,Yikun Zong,Tong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hestia introduces a Hessian-guided differentiable quantization-aware training framework for low-bit LLMs, improving performance over existing methods by using softmax relaxation and Hessian metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of large language models is hindered by memory constraints, necessitating extremely low-bit quantization. Current QAT methods suffer from premature discretization and gradient mismatch.

Method: Hestia replaces hard rounding with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation and uses tensor-wise Hessian trace metrics for fine-grained temperature annealing.

Result: Hestia outperforms ternary QAT baselines, achieving average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for 1B and 3B models, respectively.

Conclusion: Hestia's Hessian-guided relaxation enhances representational capacity, providing a robust training path for 1.58-bit LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, deployment is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory wall, motivating a shift toward extremely low-bit quantization. However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models. These results indicate that Hessian-guided relaxation effectively recovers representational capacity, establishing a more robust training path for 1.58-bit LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/hestia2026/Hestia.

TL;DR: PCPL in MORL learns policies conditioned on user preferences for diverse Pareto-optimal solutions. The paper introduces GraphAllocBench, a scalable benchmark for PCPL, and new evaluation metrics PNDS and OS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PCPL benchmarks lack realism and scalability. GraphAllocBench addresses this gap with a graph-based resource allocation environment.

Method: Introduces GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark with diverse objectives and preferences, and proposes PNDS and OS metrics. Evaluates MLPs and graph-aware models.

Result: GraphAllocBench highlights MORL limitations and supports graph-based methods like GNNs for complex tasks.

Conclusion: GraphAllocBench is versatile and extensible, advancing PCPL research.

Abstract: Preference-Conditioned Policy Learning (PCPL) in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) aims to approximate diverse Pareto-optimal solutions by conditioning policies on user-specified preferences over objectives. This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

TL;DR: The paper extends score-based diffusion models to infinite-dimensional function spaces for Bayesian inverse problems, introducing a method to condition these models for posterior sampling using an infinite-dimensional Doob's h-transform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the lack of theoretical grounding for conditioning diffusion models in function spaces, enabling accurate posterior sampling in Bayesian inverse problems.

Method: The authors use an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's h-transform and propose Supervised Guidance Training, a simulation-free score matching objective, for efficient posterior sampling.

Result: They demonstrate that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term, with numerical examples validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: This work provides the first function-space method for fine-tuning diffusion models to sample from posterior distributions accurately.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have recently been extended to infinite-dimensional function spaces, with uses such as inverse problems arising from partial differential equations. In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.

TL;DR: The paper addresses distributional shift in offline reinforcement learning, identifying harmful TD cross-covariance effects and proposing two strategies (partitioned buffer sampling and gradient-based correction) to mitigate bias and improve policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributional shift in offline reinforcement learning, exacerbated by scarce or OOD-dominated data, leads to biased optimization and degraded policy performance.

Method: Developed partitioned buffer sampling (Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD or C^4) and a gradient-based corrective penalty to counteract harmful TD cross-covariance effects.

Result: Empirical results show higher stability and up to 30% improvement in returns, especially with small datasets and OOD-heavy splits.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively mitigate bias from TD cross-covariance, enhancing stability and performance in offline reinforcement learning.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in offline reinforcement learning is distributional shift. Scarce data or datasets dominated by out-of-distribution (OOD) areas exacerbate this issue. Our theoretical analysis and experiments show that the standard squared error objective induces a harmful TD cross covariance. This effect amplifies in OOD areas, biasing optimization and degrading policy learning. To counteract this mechanism, we develop two complementary strategies: partitioned buffer sampling that restricts updates to localized replay partitions, attenuates irregular covariance effects, and aligns update directions, yielding a scheme that is easy to integrate with existing implementations, namely Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD (C^4). We also introduce an explicit gradient-based corrective penalty that cancels the covariance induced bias within each update. We prove that buffer partitioning preserves the lower bound property of the maximization objective, and that these constraints mitigate excessive conservatism in extreme OOD areas without altering the core behavior of policy constrained offline reinforcement learning. Empirically, our method showcases higher stability and up to 30% improvement in returns over prior methods, especially with small datasets and splits that emphasize OOD areas.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for stable, lightweight autoregressive models suitable for edge and embedded AI systems, where prediction errors accumulate over time.

Method: COMET-SG1 uses linear behavior-space encoding, memory-anchored transition estimation, and deterministic state updates, focusing on bounded long-horizon behavior.

Result: Experiments show COMET-SG1 achieves competitive short-horizon accuracy and significantly reduced long-horizon drift compared to MLP, LSTM, and k-nearest neighbor baselines.

Conclusion: COMET-SG1 offers a practical, interpretable solution for stable autoregressive prediction in edge applications, with a compact parameter footprint.

Abstract: COMET-SG1 is a lightweight, stability-oriented autoregressive regression model designed for time-series prediction on edge and embedded AI systems. Unlike recurrent neural networks or transformer-based sequence models, COMET-SG1 operates through linear behavior-space encoding, memory-anchored transition estimation, and deterministic state updates. This structure prioritizes bounded long-horizon behavior under fully autoregressive inference, a critical requirement for edge deployment where prediction errors accumulate over time. Experiments on non-stationary synthetic time-series data demonstrate that COMET-SG1 achieves competitive short-horizon accuracy while exhibiting significantly reduced long-horizon drift compared to MLP, LSTM, and k-nearest neighbor baselines. With a compact parameter footprint and operations compatible with fixed-point arithmetic, COMET-SG1 provides a practical and interpretable approach for stable autoregressive prediction in edge and embedded AI applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a distance-based copying framework to upgrade legacy machine learning models by learning replicas from input-output queries, improving fidelity and generalization over hard-label baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems need to evolve continuously, often without access to original training data or model internals. Black-box copying is a practical solution, but hard-label outputs limit its efficiency.

Method: The authors replace hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem. They introduce a smoothing and regularization scheme and two model-agnostic algorithms for distance estimation.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in fidelity and generalization accuracy over hard-label baselines, with distance outputs serving as uncertainty-related signals.

Conclusion: The proposed distance-based copying framework effectively upgrades legacy models, addressing the limitations of hard-label copying and enhancing performance.

Abstract: Deployed machine learning systems must continuously evolve as data, architectures, and regulations change, often without access to original training data or model internals. In such settings, black-box copying provides a practical refactoring mechanism, i.e. upgrading legacy models by learning replicas from input-output queries alone. When restricted to hard-label outputs, copying turns into a discontinuous surface reconstruction problem from pointwise queries, severely limiting the ability to recover boundary geometry efficiently. We propose a distance-based copying (distillation) framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem that exploits local geometry. We develop an $α$-governed smoothing and regularization scheme with Hölder/Lipschitz control over the induced target surface, and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances under label-only access. Experiments on synthetic problems and UCI benchmarks show consistent improvements in fidelity and generalization accuracy over hard-label baselines, while enabling distance outputs as uncertainty-related signals for black-box replicas.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the statistical limits of multitask learning, proving a stronger impossibility result than previous work, showing that abundant data per task doesn't overcome its inherent hardness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental statistical limits of multitask learning and clarify whether more data per task can resolve its challenges.

Method: The study builds on prior work (arXiv:2006.15785) and establishes a stronger impossibility result for adaptation in multitask learning, even with large sample sizes per task.

Result: The paper proves that multitask learning's hardness persists regardless of sample size per task, indicating deeper inherent limitations.

Conclusion: Multitask learning's fundamental challenges remain unresolved by increasing data per task, suggesting future research should explore optimal adaptivity.

Abstract: Multitask learning and related frameworks have achieved tremendous success in modern applications. In multitask learning problem, we are given a set of heterogeneous datasets collected from related source tasks and hope to enhance the performance above what we could hope to achieve by solving each of them individually. The recent work of arXiv:2006.15785 has showed that, without access to distributional information, no algorithm based on aggregating samples alone can guarantee optimal risk as long as the sample size per task is bounded.
  In this paper, we focus on understanding the statistical limits of multitask learning. We go beyond the no-free-lunch theorem in arXiv:2006.15785 by establishing a stronger impossibility result of adaptation that holds for arbitrarily large sample size per task. This improvement conveys an important message that the hardness of multitask learning cannot be overcame by having abundant data per task. We also discuss the notion of optimal adaptivity that may be of future interests.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the label complexity of active learning for decision trees, providing theoretical insights and a new algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance the theoretical understanding of active learning label complexity for decision trees as binary classifiers, addressing gaps in current knowledge.

Method: The paper analyzes the disagreement coefficient for decision trees under specific assumptions and presents a new active learning algorithm with a multiplicative error guarantee.

Result: The results show that under certain assumptions, a polylogarithmic number of label queries suffices, and the algorithm achieves a $(1+ε)$-approximate classifier. A lower bound confirms near-optimality.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the assumptions are essential for achieving low label complexity, and the proposed algorithm is nearly optimal.

Abstract: This paper advances the theoretical understanding of active learning label complexity for decision trees as binary classifiers. We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+ε)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions. Finally, we establish a label complexity lower bound, showing our algorithm's dependence on the error tolerance $ε$ is close to optimal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: condPED-ANOVA is a framework for accurately estimating hyperparameter importance in conditional search spaces, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HPI estimators like PED-ANOVA assume fixed search spaces and fail in conditional settings, where hyperparameters depend on others.

Method: Introduces a conditional HPI estimator for top-performing regions, with a closed-form solution to handle conditional dependencies.

Result: condPED-ANOVA provides meaningful importance estimates in conditional spaces, outperforming naive adaptations of existing methods.

Conclusion: condPED-ANOVA effectively addresses the challenge of estimating hyperparameter importance in conditional search spaces.

Abstract: We propose conditional PED-ANOVA (condPED-ANOVA), a principled framework for estimating hyperparameter importance (HPI) in conditional search spaces, where the presence or domain of a hyperparameter can depend on other hyperparameters. Although the original PED-ANOVA provides a fast and efficient way to estimate HPI within the top-performing regions of the search space, it assumes a fixed, unconditional search space and therefore cannot properly handle conditional hyperparameters. To address this, we introduce a conditional HPI for top-performing regions and derive a closed-form estimator that accurately reflects conditional activation and domain changes. Experiments show that naive adaptations of existing HPI estimators yield misleading or uninterpretable importance estimates in conditional settings, whereas condPED-ANOVA consistently provides meaningful importances that reflect the underlying conditional structure.

TL;DR: SDPO improves reinforcement learning by converting textual feedback into dense learning signals, outperforming traditional scalar-reward methods in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods face credit-assignment bottlenecks by relying solely on scalar rewards, ignoring rich textual feedback like runtime errors or evaluations.

Method: Introduces Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which uses the model's feedback-informed predictions as self-teachers to distill dense learning signals.

Result: SDPO enhances sample efficiency and accuracy across tasks like scientific reasoning and competitive programming, even outperforming scalar-feedback baselines.

Conclusion: SDPO effectively leverages rich textual feedback and implicit learning, achieving superior performance and discovery rates with fewer attempts.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly post-trained with reinforcement learning in verifiable domains such as code and math. Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.

*Steve Azzolin,Stefano Teso,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini,Sagar Malhotra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SE-GNN explanations can fail by being unrelated to the model's labeling process, misleadingly appearing faithful while being uninformative or even malicious. A new metric is proposed to detect such failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding SE-GNN explanations is crucial for transparency and misuse detection, but current explanations can be unreliable or misleading, lacking proper characterization of failure cases.

Method: The study identifies degenerate explanations in SE-GNNs, showing they can occur naturally or be maliciously planted. A novel faithfulness metric is introduced to detect these failures.

Result: Empirical analysis confirms SE-GNNs can achieve optimal performance while producing degenerate explanations, and existing metrics often fail to detect these issues.

Conclusion: The work underscores the need for reliable auditing tools in SE-GNNs, proposing a new metric to address the identified failures in explanation faithfulness.

Abstract: Explanations provided by Self-explainable Graph Neural Networks (SE-GNNs) are fundamental for understanding the model's inner workings and for identifying potential misuse of sensitive attributes. Although recent works have highlighted that these explanations can be suboptimal and potentially misleading, a characterization of their failure cases is unavailable. In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings. Our code is available in the supplemental.

*Zihao Wang,Hang Yin,Lihui Liu,Hanghang Tong,Yangqiu Song,Ginny Wong,Simon See*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the minimal dimension needed to embed subsets into vector spaces, finding tight bounds for various metrics and showing logarithmic dependency in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the geometric constraints of embedding subset memberships into vector spaces, addressing retrieval limitations in practical applications.

Method: Theoretical derivation of tight bounds for Minimal Embeddable Dimension (MED) and numerical simulations using centroid embeddings for subsets.

Result: Empirical support shows logarithmic dependency between MED and the number of elements, indicating learnability challenges are the main bottleneck.

Conclusion: The findings suggest future algorithm design should focus on overcoming learnability issues rather than geometric constraints.

Abstract: This paper studies the minimal dimension required to embed subset memberships ($m$ elements and ${m\choose k}$ subsets of at most $k$ elements) into vector spaces, denoted as Minimal Embeddable Dimension (MED). The tight bounds of MED are derived theoretically and supported empirically for various notions of "distances" or "similarities," including the $\ell_2$ metric, inner product, and cosine similarity. In addition, we conduct numerical simulation in a more achievable setting, where the ${m\choose k}$ subset embeddings are chosen as the centroid of the embeddings of the contained elements. Our simulation easily realizes a logarithmic dependency between the MED and the number of elements to embed. These findings imply that embedding-based retrieval limitations stem primarily from learnability challenges, not geometric constraints, guiding future algorithm design.

*Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov,Derya Umut Kulali,Taner Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PatchFormer is a patch-based time series foundation model using masked reconstruction for pretraining and lightweight adapters for transfer. It achieves state-of-the-art forecasting with less data and faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series forecasting methods need domain-specific feature engineering and large labeled datasets, which limits scalability and efficiency.

Method: PatchFormer segments time series into patches, learns multiscale representations, and uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking for pretraining. It also employs cross-domain knowledge distillation.

Result: PatchFormer reduces mean squared error by 27.3% and requires 94% less task-specific training data compared to baselines, scaling well with more data.

Conclusion: PatchFormer offers an efficient, scalable solution for time series forecasting across multiple domains with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem with applications in climate, energy, healthcare, and finance. Many existing approaches require domain-specific feature engineering and substantial labeled data for each task. We introduce PatchFormer, a patch-based time series foundation model that uses hierarchical masked reconstruction for self-supervised pretraining and lightweight adapters for efficient transfer. PatchFormer segments time series into patches and learns multiscale temporal representations with learnable aggregation across temporal scales. Pretraining uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking and objectives that encourage both local accuracy and global consistency, followed by cross-domain knowledge distillation. Experiments on 24 benchmark datasets spanning weather, energy, traffic, finance, and healthcare demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot multi-horizon forecasting, reducing mean squared error by 27.3 percent relative to strong baselines while requiring 94 percent less task-specific training data. The model exhibits near log-linear scaling with more pretraining data up to 100 billion points and processes length-512 sequences 3.8x faster than full-sequence transformers.

*Weixin Chen,Li Chen,Yuhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cofair is a single-train framework enabling post-training fairness control in recommender systems, allowing dynamic adjustments without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness-aware methods lack flexibility to adapt to varying fairness demands from stakeholders post-training, making retraining impractical.

Method: Cofair uses a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapters and user-level regularization to produce adaptable user embeddings.

Result: The framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, achieving competitive or better fairness-accuracy trade-offs than baselines without retraining.

Conclusion: Cofair offers a practical solution for flexible fairness control in recommender systems, addressing the limitations of static fairness methods.

Abstract: Despite growing efforts to mitigate unfairness in recommender systems, existing fairness-aware methods typically fix the fairness requirement at training time and provide limited post-training flexibility. However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/weixinchen98/Cofair.

### [260] [Exploring Transformer Placement in Variational Autoencoders for Tabular Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20854)
*Aníbal Silva,Moisés Santos,André Restivo,Carlos Soares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating Transformers into VAEs to improve modeling of tabular data, finding trade-offs between fidelity and diversity and noting linear relationships in Transformer blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular data poses challenges for generative models like VAEs due to their difficulty in modeling feature relationships, especially with mixed data types. Transformers, with their attention mechanism, offer better potential for capturing complex interactions.

Method: The authors empirically study the integration of Transformers into various VAE components. Experiments are conducted on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite.

Result: Results show that using Transformers for latent and decoder representations creates a trade-off between fidelity and diversity. Additionally, consecutive Transformer blocks exhibit high similarity, with decoder inputs and outputs showing nearly linear relationships.

Conclusion: Transformers can enhance VAEs for tabular data, but their positioning affects performance trade-offs and reveals linear dynamics in their blocks.

Abstract: Tabular data remains a challenging domain for generative models. In particular, the standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, typically composed of multilayer perceptrons, struggles to model relationships between features, especially when handling mixed data types. In contrast, Transformers, through their attention mechanism, are better suited for capturing complex feature interactions. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE. We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions. First, results indicate that positioning Transformers to leverage latent and decoder representations leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity. Second, we observe a high similarity between consecutive blocks of a Transformer in all components. In particular, in the decoder, the relationship between the input and output of a Transformer is approximately linear.
